See these examples:</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/hbr.jpg"\n            alt="Three reactions are shown with Lewis dot diagrams. The first shows a hydrogen with one red dot, a plus sign and a bromine with seven dots, one of which is red, connected by a right-facing arrow to a hydrogen and bromine with a pair of red dots in between them. There are also three lone pairs on the bromine. The second reaction shows a hydrogen with a coefficient of two and one red dot, a plus sign, and a sulfur atom with six dots, two of which are red, connected by a right facing arrow to two hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom. There are two red dots in between the two hydrogen atoms and the sulfur atom. Both pairs of these dots are red. The sulfur atom also has two lone pairs of dots. The third reaction shows two nitrogen atoms each with five dots, three of which are red, separated by a plus sign, and connected by a right-facing arrow to two nitrogen atoms with six red electron dots in between one another. Each nitrogen atom also has one lone pair of electrons."/>\n        <p>For more complicated molecules and molecular ions, it is helpful to follow the\n            step-by-step procedure outlined here:</p>\n        <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"/>\n        <dl>\n            <dt>Steps for Writing Lewis Structures</dt>\n            <dd>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons.
