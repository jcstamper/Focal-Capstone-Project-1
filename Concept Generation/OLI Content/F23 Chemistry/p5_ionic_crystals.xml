The packing of these ions into a\n            crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same\n            size. </p>\n        <p id="fdddbd9345674b45a7b24af4438ac5eb">Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and\n            their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction.\n            Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge\n            are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the\n            cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two\n            principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of\n            positive and negative ions in the compound. </p>\n        <p id="d915f380d97a4f23ac844498d372d696">In simple ionic structures, we usually find the\n            anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array.\n            (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions\n            larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when\n            compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy\n            one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of\n            the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane.\n            The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so\n            the hole is called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of\n            six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at the corners of\n            an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. The figure below illustrates both of\n            these types of holes. </p>\n        <p id="b163b78fc3ad4d9882c1e820cdc647e8"> </p>\n        <p id="f65b0990033d42bf9c1c346b19e38fd5"/>\n        <image id="f8be46caff6b44269510fe0fba759afb" src="../webcontent/U8M3_Holes.jpg"\n            alt="An image shows a top-view of a layer of blue spheres arranged in a sheet lying atop another sheet that is the same except the spheres are green.
