The wavelengths and intensities of the \n                    object\xe2\x80\x99s energy distribution can be measured by a spectrometer, and each distribution \n                    depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. As shown in the figure below, \n                    the maxima in these spectral distribution curves, <sub>\xce\xbb</sub>max, shift to shorter wavelengths as \n                    the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that as a metal is heated it glows \n                    red, then orange, yellow, and eventually white (as the intensities of all of the visible \n                    wavelengths become appreciable at very high temperatures). This common observation was      \n                    at the heart of the first paradox showing the fundamental limitations of classical physics \n                    that we will examine.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/em_curves_diff_temps.png" \n                    alt="Graph of wavelength (nm) vs intensity of electromagnetic radiation for several temperatures. \n                    At 5500 K the maximum intensity occurs at about 500 nm.

These expressions fit the observed experimental \n                    blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths but diverged more and more as the wavelength became shorter,\n                    with the absurd consequence of infinitely large energies as the wavelength approached zero. This became \n                    known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe", since it implied that everyday objects at room temperature should \n                    be emitting large amounts of UV light and no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment \n                    that led to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.</p> \n                \n                <p>Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for this phenomenon that\n                    fit the experimental observations. Planck treated the vibrating atoms as the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation\n                    (a premise from previous work), but instead of allowing the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a\n                    continuous set of energies (as allowed by classical physics, and as previously thought) Planck proposed that the vibrational \n                    energies were restricted to a discrete set of values for each frequency (i.e. that energy was <em style="italic">quantized</em>). </p>\n                <p><formula>$$E\\;=\\;nh\\nu\\;,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;n\\;=\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;...$$</formula></p>\n                \n                <p>The quantity <em style="italic">h</em> is a constant now known as Planck\'s constant, in his honor.\n                    Although it appears that energy is emitted and absorbed continuously and not in\n                    discrete quantities, notice that the value of Planck\'s constant is very small,\n                    6.626\xc3\x9710<sup>\xe2\x88\x9234</sup> joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy\n                    quantization is not observed in macroscopic phenomena.</p>\n                <wb:inline idref="planck_energy_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>The Photoelectric Effect</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the\n                    photoelectric effect. It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from\n                    the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than a\n                    threshold frequency, unique to the type of metal, was shone on it. Since the electrons in the metal had a\n                    certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed\n                    to have more energy - and therefore a higher frequency - to free the electrons.

Einstein also argued that the light intensity did\n                    not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to\n                    the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This\n                    explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing\n                    brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the\n                    likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.</p>\n                <p>With Einstein\'s findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Some\n                    phenomena could be explained by viewing light as a wave and other phenomena,\n                    such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by viewing light as a\n                    particle. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light\n                    is both wavelike and particle-like.
