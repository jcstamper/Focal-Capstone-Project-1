When their\n            electron configurations are added to the table as in the periodic table below, we also\n            see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of\n            these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play\n            the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest\n            energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core\n            electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties\n            of the elements.</p>\n        <p> It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the\n            chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was\n            available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it has\xe2\x80\x94the\n            arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons in the\n            same group. This arrangement is emphasized in the periodic table below. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/periodic1.jpeg" width="800"\n            alt="A periodic table, entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cElectron Configuration Table\xe2\x80\x9d is shown. The table includes the outer electron configuration information, atomic numbers, and element symbols for all elements. A square for the element hydrogen is pulled out beneath the table to provide detail. The blue shaded square includes the atomic number in the upper left corner, which is 1, the element symbol, H in the upper right corner, and the outer electron configuration in the lower, central portion of the square. For H, this is 1 s superscript 1."> </image>\n        <p> Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the\n            alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth\n            metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine\n            each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements\n            of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is\n            the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react. </p>\n      \n        <wb:inline idref="electron_config_pt_1digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n            <p> The periodic table can be divided into three categories of elements classified by the\n            orbitals being filled: main group, transition elements, and inner transition elements.\n            These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or\n            highest energy level orbitals of an atom. </p>\n        <p>Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the\n            last electron added enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and\n            red in periodic table below. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as\n            well as many metals and the intermediate semimetallic elements. The valence electrons\n            for main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga,\n            atomic number 31) has the electron configuration\n                [Ar]4s<sup>2</sup>3d<sup>10</sup>4p<sup>1</sup>, which contains three valence\n            electrons (underlined). The completely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence,\n            electrons. Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table. Just as it has 3 valence\n            electrons all of the elements in group 13 have 3 valence electrons. The periodic table\n            below indicates the number of valence electrons for each group of the main group\n            elements.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/periodic2.png" width="800"\n            alt="periodic table showing valence electrons for representative elements"> </image>\n        <p>Transition elements or transition metals are metallic elements in which the last electron\n            added enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas\n            configuration) in these elements include the ns and (n \xe2\x80\x93 1) d electrons. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/periodic3.png" width="800"\n            alt="periodic table highlighting the transition metals and inner transition metals"> </image>\n        <p>Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies\n            an f orbital. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n \xe2\x80\x93\n            2)f, the (n \xe2\x80\x93 1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:</p>\n        <p>The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)</p>\n        <p>The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)</p>\n        <p>Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series,\n            are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no\n            f electrons.</p>\n        <wb:inline idref="electron_config_2digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n              <section>\n            <title>Anomalous Electron Configurations</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron\n                    configuration of an element. However, we do find exceptions to the order of\n                    filling of orbitals that are indicated by the aufbau principle we have just\n                    discussed. For instance, the electron configurations of the transition metals\n                    chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others,\n                    are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells\n                    with very similar energy (such as with 4s and 3d), and small effects can lead to\n                    changes in the order of filling.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/periodic4.png" width="600"\n                    alt="periodic table highlighting Cr and Mo and Cu and Ag"> </image>\n                <p> In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled\n                    subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability\n                    is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the\n                    extra stability of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in\n                    Cu). Other exceptions also occur. There is no simple method to predict the\n                    exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is\n                    greater than the small differences in energy between subshells. </p>\n                <wb:inline idref="electron_config_pt_3digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n                \n              \n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\n                License</link>. </p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312</link>.</p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
