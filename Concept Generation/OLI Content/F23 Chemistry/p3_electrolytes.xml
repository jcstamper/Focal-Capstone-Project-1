These substances constitute an important class of compounds called\n            electrolytes. Substances that do not yield ions when dissolved are called\n            nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is\n            essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the\n            substance is known as a strong electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the\n            dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a weak\n            electrolyte.</p>\n        <p>Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the\n            electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct\n            electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is\n            the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged\n            entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved\n            ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to\n            electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of\n            dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or\n            qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit .</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_02_electrolyt.jpg" alt="This diagram shows three separate beakers. Each has a wire plugged into a wall outlet. In each case, the wire leads from the wall to the beaker and is split resulting in two ends. One end leads to a light bulb and continues on to a rectangle labeled with a plus sign. The other end leads to a rectangle labeled with a minus sign. The rectangles are in a solution. In the first beaker, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cEthanol No Conductivity,\xe2\x80\x9d four pairs of linked small green spheres suspended in the solution between the rectangles.

Solutions of electrolytes contain ions that permit the\n                passage of electricity. The conductivity of an electrolyte solution is related to\n                the strength of the electrolyte.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <section>\n            <title>Ionic Electrolytes</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions. The electrostatic\n                    attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole\n                    attraction. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic\n                    compounds in water.</p>\n                <p>When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and\n                    disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and\n                    solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This\n                    process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most\n                    conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,\n                    and so they are classified as strong electrolytes.</p>\n                <p>Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to\n                    water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water\n                    molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they\n                    attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water\n                    molecules penetrate between individual K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup> ions and\n                    surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together\n                    and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as seen in the\n                    illustration below. The reduction of the electrostatic attraction permits the\n                    independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution, resulting in an\n                    increase in the disorder of the system as the ions change from their fixed and\n                    ordered positions in the crystal to mobile and much more disordered states in\n                    solution. This increased disorder is responsible for the dissolution of many\n                    ionic compounds, including KCl, which dissolve with absorption of heat.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_02_waterions.jpg" alt="The diagram shows eight purple spheres labeled K superscript plus and eight green spheres labeled C l superscript minus mixed and touching near the center of the diagram. Outside of this cluster of spheres are seventeen clusters of three spheres, which include one red and two white spheres. A red sphere in one of these clusters is labeled O. A white sphere is labeled H. Two of the green C l superscript minus spheres are surrounded by three of the red and white clusters, with the red spheres closer to the green spheres than the white spheres. One of the K superscript plus purple spheres is surrounded by four of the red and white clusters.

Such is the\n                    case for compounds such as calcium carbonate (limestone), calcium phosphate (the\n                    inorganic component of bone), and iron oxide (rust).</p>\n                \n                <wb:inline idref="solutions_dnd_question" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n                <wb:inline idref="strong_electro_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n                \n               \n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Covalent Electrolytes</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very\n                    slightly ionized\xe2\x80\x94only about two out of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25\n                    \xc2\xb0C.

For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of\n                    covalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, when we dissolve\n                    hydrogen chloride in water, we find that the solution is a very good conductor.\n                    The water molecules play an essential part in forming ions: Solutions of\n                    hydrogen chloride in many other solvents, such as benzene, do not conduct\n                    electricity and do not contain ions.</p>\n                <p>Hydrogen chloride is an acid, and so its molecules react with water, transferring\n                    H<sup>+</sup> ions to form hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) and chloride ions (Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup>):</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_02_H3O_CL_img.jpg" alt="A chemical equation is shown.
