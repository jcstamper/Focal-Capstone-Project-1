Kinetic energy (KE)\n        is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position,\n        composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy\n        is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of\n        thermodynamics).</p>\n        <p> The total of all energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (<em style="italic">E</em>). As a\n            system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred\n            from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. The change\n            in internal energy of a system can be determined from the equation \xce\x94<em style="italic"\n                >E</em> = <em style="italic">q</em> + <em style="italic">w</em>. When the work done\n            by or on the system is pressure-volume work, the change in internal energy is calculated\n            using the equation: \xce\x94<em style="italic">E</em> = <em style="italic">q</em> \xe2\x88\x92 <em\n                style="italic">P</em>\xce\x94<em style="italic">V</em>. </p></body>\n</section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Introduction to Energy</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
