However, to understand how molecules with\n            more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example,\n            let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two\n            hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration\n                1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup>, with two unpaired electrons (one in each\n            of the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O\xe2\x80\x93H bonds form\n            from the overlap of these two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If\n            this were the case, the bond angle would be 90\xc2\xb0, as shown below, because p orbitals are\n            perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5\xc2\xb0,\n            not 90\xc2\xb0. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world\n            observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/hybrid1.jpg" alt="Two peanut-shaped orbitals lie perpendicular to one another. They overlap with spherical orbitals to the left and top of the diagram.">\n            <caption>The hypothetical overlap of two of the 2p orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with\n                the 1s orbitals of two hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of 90\xc2\xb0. This\n                is not consistent with experimental evidence.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H<sub>2</sub>O\n            differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with\n            the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave\n            function, \xcf\x88, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of\n            electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave\n            functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes.\n            This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization\n            and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO,\n            (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are\n            called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital\n            and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule\n            differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward\n            the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals\n            should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5\xc2\xb0). The observed angle of 104.5\xc2\xb0 is\n            experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful\n            explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate\n            predictions.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/hybrid2.jpg" alt="Two diagrams are shown and labeled \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d Diagram a shows two peanut-shaped orbitals lying in a tetrahedral arrangement around the letter \xe2\x80\x9cO.\xe2\x80\x9d Diagram b shows the same two orbitals, but they now overlap to the top and to the left with two spherical orbitals, each labeled \xe2\x80\x9cH.\xe2\x80\x9d A pair of electrons occupies each lobe of the peanut-shaped orbitals.">\n            <caption>(a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory\n                predicts a tetrahedral arrangement of hybrid orbitals.
