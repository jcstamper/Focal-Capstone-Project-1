So which\n            structure is correct? Here we will look at how to use the formal charges that we\n            calculated for each structure to decide which structure is most correct. </p>\n        <p> The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many\n            cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one\n            possible molecular structure\xe2\x80\x94different multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements\n            or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal\n            charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a\n            particular molecule or ion: </p>\n        <ol>\n            <li>A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in\n                which some formal charges are not zero.</li>\n            <li>If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the\n                smallest nonzero formal charges is preferable.</li>\n            <li>When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of\n                formal charges, the structure with the negative formal charges on the more\n                electronegative atoms is preferable.</li>\n        </ol>\n        <p>Let\'s apply these guidelines to our three structures for thiocyanate. </p>\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/form_charge2.jpg" width="700"\n            alt="Two rows of structures and numbers are shown.

However, the first arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest\n            number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline 2). Also, it places the least\n            electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative\n            element (Guideline 3).</p>\n        <p>Let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know from our\n            previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central\n            position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three\n            possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the\n            center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/form_charge3.jpg"\n            alt="Three Lewis structures are shown. The left and right structures show a carbon atom double bonded to two oxygen atoms, each of which has two lone pairs of electrons. The center structure shows a carbon atom that is triple bonded to an oxygen atom with one lone pair of electrons and single bonded to an oxygen atom with three lone pairs of electrons. The third structure shows an oxygen atom double bonded to another oxygen atom with to lone pairs of electrons. The first oxygen atom is also double bonded to a carbon atom with two lone pairs of electrons."/>\n\n        <p>Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the\n            left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).</p>\n\n        <example>\n            <p>Nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor\n                surgeries, such as the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely\n                structure for nitrous oxide? </p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/form_charge4.jpg"\n                alt="Two Lewis structures are shown with the word \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d in between them.

The right structure shows a nitrogen atom with two lone pairs of electrons double bonded to an oxygen atom that is double bonded to a nitrogen atom with two lone pairs of electrons.

A nitrogen atom with two lone pairs of electrons is double bonded to a nitrogen atom that is double bonded to an oxygen atom with two lone pairs of electrons."/>\n            <p>The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no\n                formal charge larger than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the\n                preference for having the less electronegative atom in the central position.</p>\n\n\n        </example>\n        <wb:inline idref="formal_charge2_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n        <wb:inline idref="formal_charge_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
