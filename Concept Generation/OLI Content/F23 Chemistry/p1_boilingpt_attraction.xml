In the following\n            description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion. </p>\n        <p>Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and\n            gaseous matter:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Particles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular\n                pattern; in a liquid, they are close together with no regular arrangement; in a gas,\n                they are far apart with no regular arrangement.</li>\n            <li>Particles in a solid vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in\n                relation to one another; in a liquid, they move past each other but remain in\n                essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move independently of one another\n                except when they collide.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p/>\n      \n        \n\n        <p>From everyday experience we know that substances exist in different states of matter\n            under various conditions. For example, water is a liquid at room temperature, a solid at\n            tempertures below 0 <sup>o</sup>C and a gas at temperatures above 100 <sup>o</sup>C.\n            Table salt (NaCl) is a solid a room temperature with a very high melting point and\n            boiling point of 800 <sup>o</sup>C and 1413 <sup>o</sup>C, respectively. While nitrogen\n                (N<sub>2</sub>), which is the main component in the air all around us, is a gas at\n            room temperature with a melting point of -210 <sup>o</sup>C and a boiling point of -196\n                <sup>o</sup>C. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/solid,liquid.png" width="700"\n            alt="(a)salt shaker with salt (b) glass of water (c) landscape of lake and mountain">\n            <caption>(a) Salt is a solid at room temperature, (b) water is a liquid at room\n                temperature and (c) nitrogen, which comprises ~78% of the air around us, is a gas at\n                room temperature.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>The difference in the conditions at which a substace is a solid, liquid, or gas reflect\n            the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make\n            up the substance. These attractive forces are either ionic bonds, in the case of ionic\n            compounds, or intermolecular forces (IMFs), in the case of molecular compounds. IMFs are\n            the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a\n            molecular substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module.\n            The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its attractive\n            forces and the kinetic energies (KE) of its particles. The attractive forces serve to\n            hold particles close together, whereas the particles\xe2\x80\x99 KE provides the energy required to\n            overcome these forces and thus increase the distance between particles. </p>\n        <p>Consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is cooled sufficiently, the kinetic energy\n            of its molecules decreases and the attractions between the molecules will be capable of\n            holding them together when they come into contact with each other; the gas condenses,\n            forming liquid H<sub>2</sub>O. When the liquid water is cooled even more, the kinetic\n            energy of its molecules decreases further and the attraction between the molecules will\n            be capable of holding them together in a rigid structure to form solid H<sub>2</sub>O or\n            ice.</p>\n        <wb:inline idref="imf_intro_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n\n        <p>Different substances have widely varying strengths of attractive forces between their\n            particles because of their composition. These attractive forces have a direct impact on\n            boiling points and melting points. In this module, we will explore these attractive\n            forces and their effects. Note that throughout this module we will focus primarily on\n            differences in boiling points, but, by and large, the concepts discussed can also be\n            applied to melting points.</p>\n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry </link>under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
