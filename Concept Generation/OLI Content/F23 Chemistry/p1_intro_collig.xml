Many solution properties are dependent upon the chemical identity of the\n            solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is more acidic, a\n            solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a\n            solution of sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that\n            depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their\n            identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point\n            elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties\n            is of central importance to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as\n            will be described in this module.</p>\n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under  <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
