But this is not the only way that compounds can be formed. Atoms can also make\n            chemical bonds by sharing electrons  between each other. Such bonds are called\n            covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar\n            tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or\n            fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen\n            atoms bond covalently to form an H<sub>2</sub> molecule; each hydrogen atom in the\n            H<sub>2</sub> molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same\n            number of valence electrons as the noble gas He</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/hydrogen_molecule.png"\n            alt="two hydrogen atoms form a hydrogen molecule" width="300">\n            <caption>Each of the hydrogen atoms in the hydrogen molecule shares its one valence\n                electron with the other hydrogen atom. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic\n            compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is\n            weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have\n            much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent\n            compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are\n            typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good\n            conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble\n            in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity\n            in any state.</p>\n        <wb:inline idref="covalent_form_1digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n        <p>Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the\n            hydrogen molecule, H<sub>2</sub>, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen\n            atoms. The diagram illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we\n            have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the\n            red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms\n            approach each other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1<em style="italic">s</em>) begin to\n            overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic\n            nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared\n            electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the\n            bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive\n            charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases.\n            The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is\n            achieved.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/graph.jpg" alt="A graph is shown with the x-axis labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cInternuclear distance ( p m )\xe2\x80\x9d while the y-axis is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cEnergy ( J ).\xe2\x80\x9d One value, \xe2\x80\x9c0,\xe2\x80\x9d is labeled midway up the y-axis and two values: \xe2\x80\x9c0\xe2\x80\x9d at the far left and \xe2\x80\x9c0.74\xe2\x80\x9d to the left, are labeled on the x-axis.

This low point on the graph corresponds to a drawing of two spheres that overlap considerably. The line then rises to zero on the y-axis and levels out. The point where it almost reaches zero corresponds to two spheres that overlap slightly. The line at zero on the y-axis corresponds to two spheres that are far from one another." width="500">\n            <caption>The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they\n                approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a\n                covalent bond. The bond length is the internuclear distance at which the lowest\n                potential energy is achieved.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <composite_activity purpose="learnbydoing">\n            <p>Similar to hydrogen, an oxygen atom will form a covalent bond with another oxygen\n                atom to form and oxygen molecule, O<sub>2</sub>.
