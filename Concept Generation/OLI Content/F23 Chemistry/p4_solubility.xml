You can repeat this process until the salt\n            concentration of the solution reaches its natural limit, a limit determined primarily by\n            the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent\n            attractive forces. You can be certain that you have reached this limit because, no\n            matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved salt remains. The concentration of\n            salt in the solution at this point is known as its solubility.</p>\n        <p>The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may\n            be achieved under given conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium.\n            Referring to the example of salt in water:</p>\n        <formula>$$\\mathrm{NaCl}(s)\\;\\;\\rightleftharpoons\\;\\;\\mathrm{Na}^+(aq)\\;+\\;\\mathrm{Cl}^-(aq)$$</formula>\n        <p>When a solute\xe2\x80\x99s concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be\n            saturated with that solute. If the solute\xe2\x80\x99s concentration is less than its solubility,\n            the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that contains a relatively low\n            concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration\n            is called concentrated.</p>\n        <p>If we add more salt to a saturated solution of salt, we see it fall to the bottom and no\n            more seems to dissolve. In fact, the added salt does dissolve, as represented by the\n            forward direction of the dissolution equation. Accompanying this process, dissolved salt\n            will precipitate, as depicted by the reverse direction of the equation. The system is\n            said to be at equilibrium when these two reciprocal processes are occurring at equal\n            rates, and so the amount of undissolved and dissolved salt remains constant. </p>\n        <p>Solutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such\n            solutions are said to be supersaturated, and they are interesting examples of\n            nonequilibrium states. For example, the carbonated beverage in an open container that\n            has not yet \xe2\x80\x9cgone flat\xe2\x80\x9d is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO<sub>2</sub>\n            concentration will decrease until it reaches its equilibrium value. A video showing the crystallization of \n            two supersaturated solutions of sodium acetate is shown below.</p>\n        <youtube src="M_DYQ4C9fVc"></youtube>\n        <wb:inline idref="saturated_dnd_question" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under  <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
