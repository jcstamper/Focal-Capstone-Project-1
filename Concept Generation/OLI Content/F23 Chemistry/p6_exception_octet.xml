Generally, these are molecules with central atoms\n                    from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not\n                    form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium\n                    dihydride, BeH<sub>2</sub>, and boron trifluoride, BF<sub>3</sub>, the beryllium\n                    and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is\n                    possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a\n                    fluorine atom in BF<sub>3</sub>, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental\n                    evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B\xe2\x80\x93F single\n                    bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three B\xe2\x80\x93F single bonds and an\n                    electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with\n                    an electron deficient boron. However, the B\xe2\x80\x93F bonds are slightly shorter than\n                    what is actually expected for B\xe2\x80\x93F single bonds, indicating that some double bond\n                    character is found in the actual molecule.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/exceptions5.jpg"\n                    alt="Two Lewis structures are shown.

It readily combines with a molecule containing an\n                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH<sub>3</sub> reacts with\n                        BF<sub>3</sub> because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the\n                    boron atom:</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/exceptions6.jpg"\n                    alt="A reaction is shown with three Lewis diagrams.
