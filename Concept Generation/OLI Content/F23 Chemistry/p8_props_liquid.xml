But when you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil\n                    to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The\n                    viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline,\n                    and other liquids that flow freely have a low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor\n                    oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown below, have\n                    higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a\n                    metal ball falls through a liquid (the ball falls more slowly through a more\n                    viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a\n                    narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly).</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_02_Viscosity.jpg" alt="Two photographs are shown and labeled \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d Photo a shows a jar of honey with a dipper drizzling it onto a biscuit.
