French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely\n            regarded as the \xe2\x80\x9cfather of modern chemistry,\xe2\x80\x9d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a\n            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation\n            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the\n            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He\n            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,\n            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt took the mob only a moment\n            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.\xe2\x80\x9d<sup>1</sup></p>\n        <p>As described in an earlier in this course, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for\n            answers to many of the questions that ask \xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d We can answer the question with\n            masses of substances or volumes of solutions. However, we can also answer this question\n            another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the\n            pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the\n            ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal\n            with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions\n            involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will\n            provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already\n            discussed.</p>\n        <p> Footnote </p>\n        <p>1 \xe2\x80\x9cQuotations by Joseph-Louis Lagrange,\xe2\x80\x9d last modified February 2006, accessed February\n            10, 2015, http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Quotations/Lagrange.html</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of\n                    molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and\n                    temperature.
