Here they are shown in a ball-and-stick model (left). These molecules\n                have single and double carbon-carbon bonds arranged to form a geometric framework of\n                hexagons and pentagons, similar to the pattern on a soccer ball (center). This\n                unconventional molecular structure is named after architect R. Buckminster Fuller,\n                whose innovative designs combined simple geometric shapes to create large, strong\n                structures such as this weather radar dome near Tucson, Arizona (right).

But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was\n            recognized: buckminsterfullerene, commonly known as a \xe2\x80\x9cbuckyball.\xe2\x80\x9d This molecule was\n            named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895\xe2\x80\x931983), whose\n            signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell\n            structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C\n            60 , and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable\n            molecule. They were guided by bonding theory\xe2\x80\x94the topic of this unit\xe2\x80\x94which explains\n            how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.</p>\n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
