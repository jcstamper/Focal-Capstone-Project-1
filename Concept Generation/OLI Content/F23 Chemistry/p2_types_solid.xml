These forces are primarily responsible for the physical\n            properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections provide descriptions of\n            the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and\n            molecular.</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Ionic Solids</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive\n                    and negative ions that are held together by electrostatic attractions, which can\n                    be quite strong. Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due\n                    to the very strong attractions between the ions\xe2\x80\x94in ionic compounds, the\n                    attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the\n                    partial charges in polar molecular compounds. Although they are hard, they also\n                    tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not\n                    conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because\n                    their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a\n                    metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_05_IonicSolid.jpg" alt="This figure shows large purple spheres bonded to smaller green spheres in an alternating pattern.

The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform\n                    distribution of atomic nuclei within a \xe2\x80\x9csea\xe2\x80\x9d of delocalized electrons. The atoms\n                    within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as\n                    metallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All\n                    exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and\n                    malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability\n                    (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and,\n                    therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting points of the metals\n                    vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt\n                    below 200 \xc2\xb0C. Several post-transition metals also have low melting points,\n                    whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above 1000 \xc2\xb0C. These\n                    differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the\n                    metals.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_05_Metallic.jpg" alt="This figure shows large brown spheres arranged in a cube.">\n                    <caption>Copper is a metallic solid.</caption>\n                </image>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Covalent Network Solid</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Covalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other\n                    nonmetals, and some covalent compounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and\n                    silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have\n                    networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a\n                    network of covalent bonds, as shown below. To break or to melt a covalent\n                    network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds are\n                    relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by\n                    hardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the\n                    hardest substances known and melts above 3500 \xc2\xb0C.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_05_NtwrkSolid.jpg" alt="Four pairs of images are shown.

Graphite is an exceptional example, composed of\n                        planar sheets of covalent crystals that are held together in layers by\n                        noncovalent forces.

The strengths of the attractive forces\n                    between the units present in different crystals vary widely, as indicated by the\n                    melting points of the crystals. Small symmetrical molecules (nonpolar\n                    molecules), such as H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and\n                        F<sub>2</sub>, have weak attractive forces and form molecular solids with\n                    very low melting points (below \xe2\x88\x92200 \xc2\xb0C). Substances consisting of larger,\n                    nonpolar molecules have larger attractive forces and melt at higher\n                    temperatures. Molecular solids composed of molecules with permanent dipole\n                    moments (polar molecules) melt at still higher temperatures.
