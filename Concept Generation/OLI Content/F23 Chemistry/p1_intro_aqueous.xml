However, mixtures\xe2\x80\x94samples of matter\n            containing two or more substances physically combined\xe2\x80\x94are more commonly encountered in\n            nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition\n            of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount\n            of oxygen in a planet\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The\n            relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known\n            as an \xe2\x80\x9calloy\xe2\x80\x9d) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative\n            amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving\n            the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage\n            determines its sweetness. In this section, we will describe one of the most common ways\n            in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.</p>\n\n        <section>\n            <title>Solutions</title>\n\n            <body>\n                <p>We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the\n                    composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout\n                    its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been\n                    implemented in many forms of man-made technology. Here we will introduce some of\n                    the basic properties of solutions.</p>\n\n                <p>The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration.\n                    Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a <extra><anchor>concentration</anchor><meaning><material><p>quantitative measure of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present in a solution</p></material></meaning></extra>\n                    that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component\n                    is called the <extra><anchor>solvent</anchor><meaning><material><p>solution component present in a concentration that is higher relative to other components</p></material></meaning></extra> and may be viewed as the medium in which the other\n                    components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent\n                    are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the\n                    solvent is called an <extra><anchor>aqueous solution</anchor><meaning><material><p>solution for which water is the solvent</p></material></meaning></extra>. Water has the ability to dissolve many\n                    different types of substances. Because of this, it is often referred to as the\n                    universal solvent.</p>\n\n                <p>A <extra><anchor>solute</anchor><meaning><material><p>solution component present in a concentration less than that of the solvent</p></material></meaning></extra> is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower\n                    concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with\n                    qualitative terms such as <extra><anchor>dilute</anchor><meaning><material><p>qualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively low concentration</p></material></meaning></extra> (of relatively low concentration) and\n                    <extra><anchor>concentrated</anchor><meaning><material><p>qualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively high concentration</p></material></meaning></extra> (of relatively high concentration).</p>\n\n\n\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <wb:inline idref="aqueous_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
