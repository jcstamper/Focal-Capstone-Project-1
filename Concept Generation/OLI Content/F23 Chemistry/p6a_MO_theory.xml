However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen\n            molecule O<sub>2</sub>, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would\n            write the following Lewis structure for O<sub>2</sub>:</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/oxygen_LS.jpg"\n            alt="A Lewis structure is shown. It is made up of two oxygen atoms, each with two lone pairs of electrons, bonded together with a double bond."/>\n        <p>This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an\n            O=O double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this\n            picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, O<sub>2</sub> is not\n            magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past\n            a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as seen\n            in the image below. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it\n            arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of O<sub>2</sub>\n            indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/oxygen_mag.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="A pitcher is shown pouring liquid oxygen through the gap between two magnets, where it has formed a solid disk. A call out box near the stream of liquid oxygen shows an image of six pairs of spheres, spread apart from one another. Another call out box near the solid disk shows ten pairs of spheres much closer together.">\n            <caption>Oxygen molecules orient randomly most of the time, as shown in the top\n                magnified view. However, when we pour liquid oxygen through a magnet, the molecules\n                line up with the magnetic field, and the attraction allows them to stay suspended\n                between the poles of the magnet where the magnetic field is strongest. Other\n                diatomic molecules (like N<sub>2</sub>) flow past the magnet.

When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field\n            (seen in the diagram below), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will\n            appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the\n            number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/oxygen_maganetic.jpg" width="500"\n            alt="A diagram depicts a stand supporting two objects that are held in balance by a horizontal bar.

The\n            Lewis-structure model does not predict the presence of these two unpaired electrons.\n            Unlike oxygen, the apparent weight of most molecules decreases slightly in the presence\n            of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Materials in which all of the electrons are paired\n            are diamagnetic and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic\n            materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in the presence of an applied magnetic\n            field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion.</p>\n        <p>Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that\n            accounts for the paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a\n            number of other molecules, such as violations of the octet rule and more molecules with\n            more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are difficult to describe\n            with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of\n            electrons in a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence\n            bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that are assigned to one specific atom, MO\n            theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are\n            delocalized over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent\n            atoms. MO theory also helps us understand why some substances are electrical conductors,\n            others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators. The table below summarizes\n            the main points of the two complementary bonding theories. Both theories provide\n            different, useful ways of describing molecular structure.</p>\n        \n       <wb:inline idref="para_dimagnetic_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n\n        <table>\n            <title> Comparison of Bonding Theories</title>\n            <tr>\n                <th> Valence Bond Theory</th>\n                <th> Molecular Orbital Theory</th>\n            </tr>\n\n\n            <tr>\n                <td>considers bonds as localized between one pair of atoms</td>\n                <td>considers electrons delocalized throughout the entire molecule</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>creates bonds from overlap of atomic orbitals (s, p, d\xe2\x80\xa6) and hybrid orbitals\n                    (sp, sp<sup>2</sup>, sp<sup>3</sup>\xe2\x80\xa6)</td>\n                <td>combines atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals (\xcf\x83, \xcf\x83*, \xcf\x80, \xcf\x80*)</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td> forms \xcf\x83 or \xcf\x80 bonds</td>\n                <td>creates bonding and antibonding interactions based on which orbitals are\n                    filled</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>predicts molecular shape based on the number of regions of electron density</td>\n                <td>predicts the arrangement of electrons in molecules</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td> needs multiple structures to describe resonance </td>\n                <td/>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n                >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n                href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n                >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
