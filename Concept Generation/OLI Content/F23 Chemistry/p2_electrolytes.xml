However, not all substances dissolve in water in the same way.\n            Let\'s look at ordinary table salt, NaCl, and table sugar,\n                C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> (sucrose), dissolved in water. You know\n            from everyday experience that both of these substances are soluble in water, but on a\n            molecular level the way in which they dissolve is quite different and results in\n            solutions with different properties.</p>\n\n        <p>When NaCl dissolves in water, the sodium ions and the chloride ions break away from the\n            solid and each individual ion is surrounded by water molecules. This breaking apart of\n            the ions is referred to as <extra>\n                <anchor>dissociation</anchor>\n                <meaning>\n                    <material>\n                        <p>physical process accompanying the dissolution of an ionic compound in\n                            which the compound\xe2\x80\x99s constituent ions are solvated and dispersed\n                            throughout the solution</p>\n                    </material>\n                </meaning>\n            </extra>. NaCl is a substance that completely, or nearly completely dissociates in\n            water. Nearly 100% of the ions separate into the solution.</p>\n\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/NaCl.png"\n            alt="The diagram shows eight purple spheres labeled K superscript plus and eight green spheres labeled C l superscript minus mixed and touching near the center of the diagram. Outside of this cluster of spheres are seventeen clusters of three spheres, which include one red and two white spheres. A red sphere in one of these clusters is labeled O. A white sphere is labeled H. Two of the green C l superscript minus spheres are surrounded by three of the red and white clusters, with the red spheres closer to the green spheres than the white spheres. One of the K superscript plus purple spheres is surrounded by four of the red and white clusters. The white spheres of these clusters are closest to the purple spheres."/>\n\n\n\n        <p>One important property of the resulting solution is its ability to conduct electricity.\n            Conductivity of a solution can be tested with an apparatus such as the one seen below.\n            Solutions that contain charged particles (ions) allow the electric current to flow\n            between the anodes. This will complete the circuit and cause the light bulb to light up.\n            Substances, like NaCl, that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called <extra>\n                <anchor>electrolytes</anchor>\n                <meaning>\n                    <material>\n                        <p>substances that produces ions when dissolved in water</p>\n                    </material>\n                </meaning>\n            </extra>.

Notice in the animation above that the sugar molecule\n            remains intact when dissolved in water. Substances, such as sugar, that when dissolved\n            in water do not conduct electricity are referred to as <extra>\n                <anchor>nonelectrolytes</anchor>\n                <meaning>\n                    <material>\n                        <p>substances that does not produce ions when dissolved in water</p>\n                    </material>\n                </meaning>\n            </extra>.</p>\n\n        <p>Other substances when dissolved in water only dissociate to a small extent. Acetic acid,\n            vinegar, is an example of one such substance. When acetic acid is in water it\n            dissociates only slightly (about 1%). There are some charged particles in the solution,\n            but relatively few. Because of this, an acetic acid solution will conduct electricity,\n            but only to a small extent. Substances that conduct electricity to a small extent are\n            referred to as <extra>\n                <anchor>weak electrolytes</anchor>\n                <meaning>\n                    <material>\n                        <p>substances that ionizes only partially when dissolved in water</p>\n                    </material>\n                </meaning>\n            </extra>. \n            Whereas NaCl, as discussed previously, that completely dissociates and conducts electricity to a large extent is a strong electrolyte.\n            </p>\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/HC2H3O2.png" alt="\n            This diagram shows a beaker with a wire plugged into a wall outlet. The wire leads from the wall to the beaker and is split resulting in two ends. One end leads to a light bulb and continues on to a rectangle labeled with a plus sign. The other end leads to a rectangle labeled with a minus sign. The rectangles are in a solution. The beaker is labeled HC2H3O2 Low Conductivity. When acetic acid is dissolved in water it partially dissociates into H+ and CH2O3-. The H+ ions are attracted to a negative electrode and the CH2O3- ions are attracted to positive electrode. The solution weakly conducts electricity."/>\n\n        <p>Under most conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,\n            and are classified as strong electrolytes. Most molecular compounds, with the exception\n            of acids, do not dissociate when dissolved in water and are nonelectrolytes. </p>\n\n        <p>While acids and bases will be discussed in more detail later, it is important to note\n            here that strong acids are strong electrolytes because they completely dissociate into\n                H<sup>+</sup> and their constituent anion. For instance, the strong acid nitric\n            acid, HNO<sub>3</sub>, dissociates into H<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\n            ions. Likewise, the strong acid perchloric acid dissociates into H<sup>+</sup> and\n                ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>. </p>\n\n        <p>Weak acids and bases, on the other hand, are weak electrolytes. Weak acids only\n            dissociate slightly. As we saw above with the weak acid, acetic acid. While it does\n            produce H<sup>+</sup> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, it\n            only does so to a small extent. </p>\n\n\n        <section>\n            <title>Electrolytes and Nonelectrolytes</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>\n                    <table>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th colspan="2">Electrolytes</th>\n\n                            <th>Nonelectrolytes</th>\n                        </tr>\n\n                        <tr>\n\n                            <td rowspan="2"><em>strong</em></td>\n\n                            <td>strong acids</td>\n                            <td rowspan="3">most molecular compounds</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td>ionic compounds</td>\n                        </tr>\n\n                        <tr>\n                            <td rowspan="2"><em>weak</em></td>\n\n                            <td>weak acids and bases</td>\n                        </tr>\n\n                        <!-- <tr><td>most molecular compounds</td></tr> -->\n                    </table>\n                </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n\n        <wb:inline idref="electrolytes_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n\n\n        <wb:inline idref="conduct_dnd_question" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n                >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n                href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n                >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
