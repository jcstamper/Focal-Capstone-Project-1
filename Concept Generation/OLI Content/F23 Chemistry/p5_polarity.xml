We refer to this as a pure, or nonpolar, covalent bond. Electrons shared in pure\n            covalent bonds have an equal probability of being near each nucleus. In the case of\n                Cl<sub>2</sub>, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl\n            shares one electron with the other, forming one covalent bond:</p>\n        <formula>$$\\mathrm{Cl}\\;+\\;\\mathrm{Cl}\\;\\longrightarrow\\;{\\mathrm{Cl}}_2$$</formula>\n\n        <p>The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding\n            electrons and two shared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching\n            the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since the bonding atoms are\n            identical, Cl<sub>2</sub> also features a pure covalent bond.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/chlorine_molecule.png">\n            <caption>Chlorine molecule showing the valence shell of the two chlorine atoms and the 2\n                electrons being shared between them.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared,\n            but no longer equally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom\n            than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density toward that atom. This\n            unequal distribution of electrons is known as a <extra><anchor>polar covalent bond</anchor><meaning><material><p>covalent bond between atoms of different electronegativities; a covalent bond with a positive end and a negative end</p></material></meaning></extra>, characterized by a\n            partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom\n            that attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice\n            versa. For example, the electrons in the H\xe2\x80\x93Cl bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend\n            more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule,\n            the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial\n            positive charge. Figure shows the distribution of electrons in the H\xe2\x80\x93Cl bond. Note that\n            the shaded area around Cl is much larger than it is around H. Compare this to the\n                H<sub>2</sub> nonpolar bond which shares electrons equally and there is an even\n            distribution of electrons between the two atoms. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/hydrogen_molecule2.png"\n            alt="Even distribution of electron density in the hydrogen molecule">\n            <caption>The two hydrogen atoms share electrons equally.
