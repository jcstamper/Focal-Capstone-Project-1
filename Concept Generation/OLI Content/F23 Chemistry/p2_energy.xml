As well as having kinetic and\n            potential energy, energy is being transferred from the skateboard to the surface of the\n            track in the form of thermal energy caused by the interaction between the wheels of the\n            skateboard and the surface of the track. Return to the skatepark simulation and choose\n            the "Friction" screen. Again click to show the bar graph. Drag the skater to the top of\n            the track and observe the changes in energy now that the thermal energy due to friction\n            is accounted for.</p>\n\n        <p>When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of\n            one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the\n            conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example,\n            chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose\n            gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a car\xe2\x80\x99s engine, the rapidly\n            expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type\n            of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders\xe2\x80\x99 pistons.</p>\n\n        <p>For chemical reactions, mass and energy are conserved separately. The total mass present\n            before the reaction occurs is equal to the total mass present after the reaction occurs.\n            Likewise, the total energy present before the reaction occurs is equal to the total\n            energy present after the reaction occurs. However, for nuclear reactions, mass can be\n            converted into energy according to Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s formula (<em style="italic">E</em> = <em style="italic">mc</em><sup>2</sup>, where <em\n                style="italic">E</em> is energy, <em style="italic">m</em> is mass, and <em\n                style="italic">c</em> is the speed of light). In nuclear reactions, the total mass\n            changes and this leads to changes in energy that are much larger (by factors of a\n            million or so) than chemical reactions. To encompass both chemical and nuclear changes,\n            we combine these laws into one statement: The total quantity of matter and energy in the\n            universe is fixed. For most of this course, we will considering only chemical reactions,\n            and so energy and mass are separately conserved. </p>\n\n\n        <p>The animations and activities that follow show how energy is transformed from one type to\n            another in certain processes. In considering systems such as these, kinetic energy is\n            often referred to as mechanical energy. </p>\n\n        <wb:inline idref="energy_transfer_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
