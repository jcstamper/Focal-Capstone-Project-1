The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids,\n                covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of\n                crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the\n                arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them.\n                Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have\n                distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of\n                interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. </p></body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">The Solid State of Matter</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
