This\n            picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature \xe2\x80\x9csolar\n            system\xe2\x80\x9d with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. This\n            classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron\n            moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and,\n            according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic\n            radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electron\xe2\x80\x99s orbit getting\n            continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are\n            inherently unstable.</p>\n        <p>In 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical\n            electromagnetism\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously\n            emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the\n            atom Planck\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of quantization and Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s finding that light consists of\n            photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron\n            orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state\n            hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The\n            energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies. </p>\n        <p>Bohr assumed that only discrete values for these could occur. Bohr was able to calculate\n            the energies of each orbital and he found that they fit the following equation:</p>\n        <formula>$$E_n=\\frac{-k}{n^2},\\;n=1,2,3,\\dots$$</formula>\n        <p>In this expression, <em style="italic">k</em> is a constant comprising fundamental constants of Ryberg\'s contant,\n            Planck\xe2\x80\x99s constant and the speed of light ( <em style="italic">k</em> = <em style="italic">(\xe2\x88\x92hcR<sub>H</sub>)</em> =\n            2.18\xc3\x9710<sup>-18</sup> J ). The energies of the orbitals calculated are seen in the\n            image below. Notice that as the more negative the calculated value, the lower the energy\n            with <em style="italic">n</em> = 1 having the most negative value, which means it has the lowest energy. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/quantum.jpeg" width="600"\n            alt="The figure includes a diagram representing the relative energy levels of the quantum numbers of the hydrogen atom.

The more negative the\n                calculated value, the lower the energy. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest\n            possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit,\n            the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. \n            When the electron is in this lowest energy\n            orbit, the atom is said to be in its <extra><anchor>ground electronic state</anchor><meaning><material><p>state in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible</p></material></meaning></extra> (or simply ground state). If the\n            atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to\n            an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an <extra><anchor>excited electronic state</anchor><meaning><material><p>state having an energy greater than the ground-state energy</p></material></meaning></extra> (or\n            simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an\n            excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the\n            difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an\n            atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more\n            excited one.</p>\n        <p> We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about\n            energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy\n            energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron\n            from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the\n            electron returns to its initial state. In effect, an atom can \xe2\x80\x9cstore\xe2\x80\x9d energy by using it\n            to promote an electron to a state with a higher energy and release it when the electron\n            returns to a lower state. The energy can be released as one quantum of energy, as the\n            electron returns to its ground state (say, from <em style="italic">n</em> = 5 to <em style="italic">n</em> = 1), or it can be released\n            as two or more smaller quanta as the electron falls to an intermediate state, then to\n            the ground state (say, from <em style="italic">n</em> = 5 to <em style="italic">n</em> = 4, emitting one quantum, then to <em style="italic">n</em> = 1,\n            emitting a second quantum). </p>\n        \n        <section>\n            <title>Slide Show</title>\n            <body><iframe src="https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/212824" width="800" height="472"></iframe></body>\n        </section>\n        \n        \n        <wb:inline idref="bohr_model_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="http://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\n                License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
