(credit: modification of work by Paul Flowers)</caption>\n        </image>\n\n        <p>Your overall health and susceptibility to disease depends upon the complex interaction\n            between your genetic makeup and environmental exposure, with the outcome difficult to\n            predict. Early detection of biomarkers, substances that indicate an organism\xe2\x80\x99s disease\n            or physiological state, could allow diagnosis and treatment before a condition becomes\n            serious or irreversible. Recent studies have shown that your exhaled breath can contain\n            molecules that may be biomarkers for recent exposure to environmental contaminants or\n            for pathological conditions ranging from asthma to lung cancer. Scientists are working\n            to develop biomarker \xe2\x80\x9cfingerprints\xe2\x80\x9d that could be used to diagnose a specific disease\n            based on the amounts and identities of certain molecules in a patient\xe2\x80\x99s exhaled breath.\n            An essential concept underlying this goal is that of a molecule\xe2\x80\x99s identity, which is\n            determined by the numbers and types of atoms it contains, and how they are bonded\n            together. This unit will describe some of the fundamental chemical principles related\n            to the composition of matter, including those central to the concept of molecular\n            identity.</p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
