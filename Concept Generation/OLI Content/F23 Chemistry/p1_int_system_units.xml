Every measurement provides three\n            kinds of information: </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>the size or magnitude of the measurement (a number)</li>\n            <li>a standard of comparison for the measurement (a unit)</li>\n            <li>an indication of the uncertainty of the measurement</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p> While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the\n            uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented\n            and will be discussed later. The number in the measurement can be represented in\n            different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation.</p>\n\n        <p>Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for\n            measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of\n            the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees\n            to be 1 liter. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life\n            threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patient\xe2\x80\x99s seizures\n            and states a dosage of \xe2\x80\x9c100\xe2\x80\x9d without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing\n            to the medical professional giving the dose, but also the consequences can be dire: 100 mg\n            given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of\n            100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.</p>\n\n        <p>We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version\n            of the metric system, using the units listed in table below. Other units can be derived\n            from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international\n            agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the\n            French, Le Syst\xc3\xa8me International d\xe2\x80\x99Unit\xc3\xa9s). SI units have been used by the United States\n            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964.</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Base Quantities and Units of the SI System</title>\n            <body>\n\n                <table>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Quantity</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Symbol for Quantity</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">SI Unit</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Symbol for Base Unit</em></td>\n                        \n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>length</td>\n                        <td>&ell;</td>\n                        <td>meter</td>\n                        <td>m</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>mass</td>\n                        <td><em style="italic">m</em></td>\n                        <td>kilogram</td>\n                        <td>kg</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>time</td>\n                        <td><em style="italic">t</em></td>\n                        <td>second</td>\n                        <td>s</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>temperature</td>\n                        <td><em style="italic">T</em></td>\n                        <td>kelvin</td>\n                        <td>K</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>electric current</td>\n                        <td><em style="italic">I</em></td>\n                        <td>ampere</td>\n                        <td>A</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>amount of substance</td>\n                        <td><em style="italic">n</em></td>\n                        <td>mole</td>\n                        <td>mol</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>luminous intensity</td>\n                        <td><em style="italic">I<sub>v</sub></em></td>\n                        <td>candela</td>\n                        <td>cd</td>\n                    </tr>\n\n\n                </table>\n                <p>Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream\n                    is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons\n                    (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but\n                    these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI\n                    units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a\n                    length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means\n                    \xe2\x80\x9cone thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d which in scientific notation is 10<sup>3</sup> (1 kilometer =\n                    1000 m = 10<sup>3</sup> m). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are\n                    raised are listed in table below.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Common Unit Prefixes</title>\n            <body>\n                <table>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Prefix</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Symbol</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Factor</em></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>femto</td>\n                        <td>f</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-15</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>pico</td>\n                        <td>p</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-12</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>nano</td>\n                        <td>n</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-9</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>micro</td>\n                        <td>\xce\xbc</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-6</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>milli</td>\n                        <td>m</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-3</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>centi</td>\n                        <td>c</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-2</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>deci</td>\n                        <td>d</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>-1</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>kilo</td>\n                        <td>k</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>3</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>mega</td>\n                        <td>M</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>6</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>giga</td>\n                        <td>G</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>9</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>tera</td>\n                        <td>T</td>\n                        <td>10<sup>12</sup></td>\n                    </tr>\n\n\n                </table>\n                <wb:inline idref="unit_prefixes_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>SI Base Units</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI\n                    system, were established in France during the French Revolution.

A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from\n                    the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a\n                    vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer\n                    than a yard (Figure); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer\n                    distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 10<sup>3</sup> m),\n                    whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m =\n                        10<sup>-2</sup> m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10<sup>-3</sup> m).</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/length.jpg" width="600"\n                    alt="One meter is slightly larger than a yard and one centimeter is less than half the size of one inch. 1 inch is equal to 2.54 cm. 1 m is equal to 1.094 yards which is equal to 39.36 inches.">\n                    <caption>The relative lengths of 1 m, 1 yd, 1 cm, and 1 in. are shown (not\n                        actual size), as well as comparisons of 2.54 cm and 1 in., and of 1 m and\n                        1.094 yd. </caption>\n                </image>\n            </body>\n\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Mass</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). The kilogram was\n                    previously defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n                    (IUPAC) as the mass of a specific reference object. This object was originally\n                    one liter of pure water, and more recently it was a metal cylinder made from a\n                    platinum-iridium alloy with a height and diameter of 39 mm. In May\n                    2019, this definition was changed to one that is based instead on precisely\n                    measured values of several fundamental physical constants. One kilogram is\n                    about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass of the\n                    kilogram (10<sup>\xe2\x88\x923</sup> kg).</p>\n              \n                <image src="../webcontent/mass.jpg" width="400"\n                    alt="The photo shows a small metal cylinder on a stand.

The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin\n                    (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K\n                    (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word \xe2\x80\x9cdegree\xe2\x80\x9d nor the degree\n                    symbol (&deg;). The degree Celsius (&deg;C) is also allowed in the SI system,\n                    with both the word \xe2\x80\x9cdegree\xe2\x80\x9d and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements.\n                    Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales\n                    place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 &deg;C) and\n                    boils at 373.15 K (100 &deg;C) by definition, and normal human body temperature\n                    is approximately 310 K (37 &deg;C). The conversion between these two units and\n                    the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this module.</p>\n            </body>\n\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Time</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The SI base unit of time is the second (s).
