A solution may be saturated with the compound at an\n            elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a\n            lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains\n            solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower\n            temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the\n            excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal or by mechanically agitating the\n            solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one pictured in Figure, take advantage of this\n            behavior.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_03_handwarmer.jpg" alt="Three photos of hand warmers are shown side by side with an arrow pointing from the first photo to the second, and another arrow pointing from the second photo to the third.
