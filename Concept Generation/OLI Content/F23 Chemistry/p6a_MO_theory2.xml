Just like electrons around\n            isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized)\n            energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be\n            found is called a molecular orbital (\xce\xa8<sup>2</sup>). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular\n            orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.</p>\n        <p>We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms\n                (H<sub>2</sub> or Cl<sub>2</sub>, for example). Such molecules are called\n            homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular\n            orbitals occur.</p>\n        <p>The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is\n            called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the\n            wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic\n            orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which\n            peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with\n            troughs, as seen below. In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine\n            with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and\n            out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/waves.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="A pair of diagrams are shown and labeled, \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d Diagram a shows two identical waves with two crests and two troughs. They are drawn one above the other with a plus sign in between and an equal sign to the right. To the right of the equal sign is a much taller wave with a same number of troughs and crests. Diagram b shows two waves with two crests and two troughs, but they are mirror images of one another rotated over a horizontal axis. They are drawn one above the other with a plus sign in between and an equal sign to the right. To the right of the equal sign is a flat line.">\n            <caption>(a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with\n                greater amplitude. (b) When out-of-phase waves combine, destructive interference\n                produces a wave with less (or no) amplitude.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s\n            orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated below. The in-phase\n            combination produces a lower energy \xcf\x83<sub>s</sub> molecular orbital (read as "sigma-s") in which\n            most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition\n            (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher\n            energy \xcf\x83<sup>\xe2\x88\x97</sup><sub>s</sub> molecular orbital (read as "sigma-s-star") molecular orbital in which there\n            is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding\n            orbital. Electrons in a \xcf\x83<sub>s</sub> orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are\n            more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons\n            to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these\n            orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the \xcf\x83<sup>\xe2\x88\x97</sup><sub>s</sub> orbitals are located well away from the\n            region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these\n            electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding\n            orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy\n            antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill\n            higher-energy atomic orbitals.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/MO-theory_phase.jpg" width="500"\n            alt="A diagram is shown that depicts a vertical upward-facing arrow that lies to the left of all the other portions of the diagram and is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cE.\xe2\x80\x9d To the immediate right of the midpoint of the arrow are two circles each labeled with a positive sign, the letter S, and the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cAtomic orbitals.\xe2\x80\x9d These are followed by a right-facing horizontal arrow that points to the same two circles labeled with plus signs, but they are now touching and are labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cCombine atomic orbitals.\xe2\x80\x9d Two right-facing arrows lead to the last portion of the diagram, one facing upward and one facing downward.

We indicate\n            the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same\n            phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When\n            regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron\n            density and creates nodes. When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create \xcf\x83 and \xcf\x83*\n            orbitals. If two atoms are located along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system,\n            the two p<sub>x</sub> orbitals overlap end to end and form \xcf\x83<sub>px</sub> (bonding) and \xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x97<sub>px</sub> (antibonding)\n            (read as "sigma-p-x" and "sigma-p-x star," respectively). Just as with s-orbital\n            overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a\n            higher-energy, antibonding orbital.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/MO_sigma_pi.jpg" width="550"\n            alt="Two horizontal rows of diagrams are shown.

In valence bond theory,\n            we describe \xcf\x80 bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and\n            perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either side of\n            the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the \xcf\x80 orbital by this same shape, and\n            a \xcf\x80 bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact\n            with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For\n            the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the\n            internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/mo_theory_pi.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="Two horizontal rows of diagrams are shown.
