For a theory to be accepted, it must explain\n            experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained\n            widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are\n            consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules.\n            However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.</p>\n        <p>There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use\n            quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are\n            likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p\n            orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free\n            atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe\n            the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete\n            understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the\n            electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms\n            when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the\n            nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are\n            described by valence bond theory and hybridization.</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Valence Bond Theory</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled\n                    atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of\n                    electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two\n                    different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second\n                    orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a\n                    covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom\n                    overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each\n                    orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this\n                    negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms\xe2\x80\x99 positively charged nuclei\n                    serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent\n                    bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the\n                    orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are\n                    stronger than those that have less overlap.</p>\n                <p>The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. The slideshow\n                    below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored\n                    curve) changes as they approach each other. </p>\n                \n                <section>\n                    <title>Slide Show</title>\n                    <body><iframe src="https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/196699" width="800" height="471"></iframe></body>\n                </section>\n                \n               <!-- <section>\n                    <title>Slide Show</title>\n                    <body>\n                        <p>Press "NEXT" to advance slideshow.</p>\n                        <wb:inline idref="lewis_ie"></wb:inline>\n                    </body>\n                </section>\n                -->\n                \n                \n                <p>The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the\n                    bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity\n                    of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of\n                    energy is required to break the bond. For the H<sub>2</sub> molecule shown in the\n                    slideshow, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is 7.24 \xc3\x97 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> J lower in\n                    energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number.\n                    However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond\n                    energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24\n                    \xc3\x97 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> J to break one H\xe2\x80\x93H bond, but it takes 4.36 \xc3\x97 10<sup>5</sup> J to break 1 mole of\n                    H\xe2\x80\x93H bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in the table\n                    below. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table\n                    provides average values. For example, breaking the first C\xe2\x80\x93H bond in CH<sub>4</sub>, methane, \n                    requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first C\xe2\x80\x93H bond in H\xe2\x80\x93CH<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> (toluene, a common\n                    paint thinner) requires 375.5 kJ/mol.</p>\n                <table>\n                    \n
