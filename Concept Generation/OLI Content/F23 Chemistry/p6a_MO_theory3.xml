For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of\n            one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each\n            horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular\n            orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center.\n            Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals.\n            For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular\n            orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that\n            combining the six 2p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one \xcf\x83 and two \xcf\x80)\n            and three antibonding orbitals (one \xcf\x83* and two \xcf\x80*).</p>\n        <p>We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the\n            orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle.\n            Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before\n            pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins\n            as seen in the diagram below. Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the\n            molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating\n            the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular\n            orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so\n            parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion\n            containing seven electrons (such as Be<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) would have the molecular electron\n            configuration (\xcf\x83<sub>1s</sub>)<sup>2</sup>(\xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x97<sub>1s</sub>)<sup>2</sup>(\xcf\x83<sub>2s</sub>)<sup>2</sup>(\xcf\x83\xe2\x88\x97<sub>2s</sub>)<sup>1</sup>. It is common to omit the core electrons from\n            molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence\n            electrons.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/MO-energy_dia.jpg" width="700"\n            alt="A diagram is shown that has an upward-facing vertical arrow running along the left side labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cE.\xe2\x80\x9d At the bottom center of the diagram is a horizontal line labeled, \xe2\x80\x9csigma subscript 2 s,\xe2\x80\x9d that has two vertical half arrows drawn on it, one facing up and one facing down.

The net contribution of the\n                    electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the\n                    bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by\n                    electrons.</p>\n                <p>When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in\n                    molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons\n                    between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a\n                    bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order\n                    differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of\n                    electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is\n                    more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but\n                    both methods describe the same phenomenon.</p>\n                <p>In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction\n                    if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding\n                    interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated\n                    by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing\n                    (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to\n                    get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:</p>\n                <formula>$$\\mathrm{bond}\\;\\mathrm{order}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\;(\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{bonding}\\;\\mathrm{electrons})-(\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{antibonding}\\;\\mathrm{electrons})}2$$</formula>\n                <p>The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given\n                    atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases, as seen in the table below. If the\n                    distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such\n                    that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not\n                    form. We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.</p>\n                \n                <table>\n                    <title>Representative Bond Energies and Lengths</title>\n                    <tr><th>Bond</th>\t<th>Length (pm)</th>\t<th>Energy (kJ/mol)</th>\t\t<th>Bond</th>\t<th>Length (pm)</th>\t<th>Energy (kJ/mol)</th></tr>\n                      <tr>  <td>H\xe2\x80\x93H</td>\t<td>74</td>\t<td>436</td>\t\t<td>C\xe2\x80\x93O</td>\t<td>140.1</td>\t<td>358</td></tr>\n                       <tr> <td>H\xe2\x80\x93C</td>\t<td>106.8</td>\t<td>413</td>\t<td>C=O</td>\t<td>119.7</td>\t<td>745</td></tr>\n                       <tr> <td>H\xe2\x80\x93N</td>\t<td>101.5</td>\t<td>391</td>\t<td>C\xe2\x89\xa1O</td>\t<td>113.7</td>\t<td>1072</td></tr>\n                       <tr><td> H\xe2\x80\x93O</td>\t<td>97.5</td>\t<td>467</td>\t<td>H\xe2\x80\x93Cl\t</td><td>127.5</td><td>\t431</td></tr>\n                       <tr><td> C\xe2\x80\x93C</td><td>\t150.6</td>\t<td>347</td>\t<td>H\xe2\x80\x93Br\t</td><td>141.4</td>\t<td>366</td></tr>\n                       <tr><td> C=C\t</td><td>133.5</td>\t<td>614</td>\t<td>H\xe2\x80\x93I</td><td>\t160.9</td>\t<td>298</td></tr>\n                       <tr> <td>C\xe2\x89\xa1C</td>\t<td>120.8</td>\t<td>839</td>\t<td>O\xe2\x80\x93O</td>\t<td>148</td>\t<td>146</td></tr>\n                      <tr> <td> C\xe2\x80\x93N</td>\t<td>142.1</td>\t<td>305</td>\t<td>O=O</td>\t<td>120.8</td>\t<td>498</td></tr>\n                       <tr> <td>C=N</td>\t<td>130.0</td>\t<td>615</td>\t<td>F\xe2\x80\x93F\t</td><td>141.2</td>\t<td>159</td></tr>\n                       <tr> <td>C\xe2\x89\xa1N</td>\t<td>116.1</td>\t<td>891</td>\t<td>Cl\xe2\x80\x93Cl</td>\t<td>198.8</td>\t<td>243</td></tr>\n                </table>\n                \n                \n                <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n                    >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                        href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                        4.0 License. </link></p>\n                <p>Download for free at <link\n                    href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n                    >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
