We can tell a reaction is at\n            equilibrium if the reaction quotient (Q) is equal to the equilibrium constant (K). Once\n            at equilibrium a system will remain at equilibrium until a change is imposed on the\n            system. We next address what happens when a system at equilibrium is disturbed so that Q\n            is no longer equal to K. If a system at equilibrium is subjected to a perturbance or\n            stress (such as a change in concentration) the position of equilibrium changes. Since\n            this stress affects the concentrations of the reactants and the products, the value of Q\n            will no longer equal the value of K. To re-establish equilibrium, the system will either\n            shift toward the products (if Q &lt; K) or the reactants (if Q &gt; K) until Q returns\n            to the same value as K.</p>\n        <pullout>\n            <title>Le Ch\xc3\xa2telier\'s principle</title>\n\n            <p>\n                <em> When a chemical system at equilibrium is disturbed, it returns to equilibrium\n                    by counteracting the disturbance. As described in the previous paragraph, the\n                    disturbance causes a change in Q; the reaction will shift to re-establish Q =\n                    K.</em></p>\n        </pullout>\n        <p>Le Ch\xc3\xa2telier\'s principle can be used to predict changes in equilibrium concentrations\n            when a system that is at equilibrium is subjected to a stress. However, if we have a\n            mixture of reactants and products that have not yet reached equilibrium, the changes\n            necessary to reach equilibrium may not be so obvious. In such a case, we can compare the\n            values of Q and K for the system to predict the changes.</p>\n        <p>Throughout this module we will use the following reaction to illustrate LeChatlier\'s\n            priniple.</p>\n        <formula>$$\\underset{\\mathrm{Pink}}{\\mathrm{Co}({\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm\n            O{)_6\\;^{2+}}(\\mathrm{aq})}\\;\\;+\\;4\\;\\mathrm{Cl}^-(aq)\\;\\;\\rightleftharpoons\\;\\;\\underset{\\mathrm{Blue}}{{\\mathrm{CoCl}}_4\\;^{2-}(\\mathrm{aq})}\\;+\\;6\\;{\\mathrm\n            H}_2\\mathrm O(l)$$</formula>\n        <p>Although not the case for most reversible reactions, changes that occur in concentration\n            in products and reactants for this reaction are visible.</p>\n        <composite_activity purpose="learnbydoing">\n            <p>One way to make blue pigments for jewelry or paints is to use compounds that contain\n                cobalt (Co). When cobalt ions, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Cloride ions, Cl<sup>-</sup>,\n                dissolve in water, cobalt either surrounds itself with water molecules to form\n                    Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup>, or with cloride ions to form\n                    CoCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.
