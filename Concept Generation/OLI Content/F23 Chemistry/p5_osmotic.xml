Biological cell membranes provide\n            elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove\n            metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of\n            how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable\n            membranes.</p>\n        <p>Consider the apparatus illustrated in the diagram below, in which samples of pure solvent\n            and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate.\n            Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the\n            concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these\n            molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a\n            faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of\n            solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of\n            solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_04_osmosis.jpg" alt="The figure shows two U shaped tubes with a semi permeable membrane placed at the base of the U. In figure a, pure solvent is present and indicated by small yellow spheres to the left of the membrane. To the right, a solution exists with larger blue spheres intermingled with some small yellow spheres. At the membrane, arrows pointing from three small yellow spheres on both sides of the membrane cross over the membrane. An arrow drawn from one of the large blue spheres does not cross the membrane, but rather is reflected back from the surface of the membrane. The levels of liquid in both sides of the U shaped tube are equal. In figure b, arrows again point from small yellow spheres across the semipermeable membrane from both sides. This diagram shows the level of liquid in the left, pure solvent, side to be significantly lower than the liquid level on the right. Dashed lines are drawn from these two liquid levels into the middle of the U-shaped tube and between them is the term osmotic pressure." width="600">\n            <caption>Osmosis results in the transfer of solvent molecules from a sample of low (or\n                zero) solute concentration to a sample of higher solute concentration.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown above, the volume of the\n            solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the\n            level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of\n            the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent\n            molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a\n            reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent\n            ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (\xce\xa0) of the solution. </p>\n        <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n        \n        <dl>\n            <dt>Osmotic Pressure</dt>\n            <dd>\n                <p>The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, <em\n                        style="italic">M</em>, and absolute temperature, <em style="italic">T</em>,\n                    according to the equation</p>\n                <formula>$$\\Pi=\\mathrm{MRT}$$</formula>\n                <p>where <em style="italic">R</em> is the universal gas constant.</p>\n            </dd>\n        </dl>\n        <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n        \n        \n        <p>If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in Figure, applying pressure\n            greater than the osmotic pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes\n            solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent. This technique of reverse\n            osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to\n            produce high-purity tap water for drinking.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_04_rvosmosis%20(1).jpg" alt="The figure shows a U shaped tube with a semi permeable membrane placed at the base of the U.

Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have\n            lost water can be made crisp again by placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot\n            or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated salt solution loses\n            water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect\n            animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are\n            injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions\n            an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body must have\n            the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood\n            serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient\n            quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood\n            cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called\n            hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the\n            cells lose water to the more concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a\n            process called crenation. These effects are illustrated below.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_04_bloodcell.jpg" alt="This figure shows three scenarios relating to red blood cell membranes. In a, H subscript 2 O has two arrows drawn from it pointing into a red disk.

In b, the image is similar except that rather than having two arrows pointing into the red disk, one points in and a second points out toward the H subscript 2 O. In the circle beneath, twelve of the red disks are present. In c, both arrows are drawn from a red shriveled disk toward the H subscript 2 O. In the circle below, twelve shriveled disks are shown." width="600">\n            <caption>Red blood cell membranes are water permeable and will (a) swell and possibly\n                rupture in a hypotonic solution; (b) maintain normal volume and shape in an isotonic\n                solution; and (c) shrivel and possibly die in a hypertonic solution.
