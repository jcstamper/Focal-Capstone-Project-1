A\n                    convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules\n                    is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities\n                    composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 \xc3\x9710<sup>23</sup>, a quantity called\n                    Avogadro\xe2\x80\x99s number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass.\n                    Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit\n                    and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) for any substance\n                    are numerically equivalent (for example, one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule weighs\n                    approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules weighs approximately\n                    18 g).</p>\n\n                <p>The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers\n                    of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent\n                    compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compound\xe2\x80\x99s percent\n                    composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it\n                    is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compound\xe2\x80\x99s empirical\n                    formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to\n                    the compound\xe2\x80\x99s molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula.</p>\n            </body>\n            \n         \n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">The Mole</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
