When the\n                    atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular\n                    orbital of lowest energy, the \xcf\x83<sub>1s</sub> bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,\n                        H<sub>2</sub>, readily forms because the energy of a H<sub>2</sub> molecule\n                    is lower than that of two H atoms. The \xcf\x83<sub>1s</sub> orbital that contains both\n                    electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.</p>\n                <p>A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the\n                        H<sub>2</sub> molecule are in the \xcf\x83<sub>1s</sub> bonding orbital; the electron\n                    configuration is (\xcf\x83<sub>1s</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.

Because of this, O<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and\n                        Ne<sub>2</sub> exhibit negligible s-p mixing (not sufficient to change the\n                    energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown\n                    above. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which\n                    leads to the pattern where the \xcf\x83<sub>p</sub> orbital is raised above the\n                        \xcf\x80<sub>p</sub> set.</p>\n                <p>Using the MO diagrams shown, we can add in the electrons and determine the\n                    molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic\n                    molecules. As shown in the table above, Be<sub>2</sub> and Ne<sub>2</sub>\n                    molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.</p>\n\n                <p>The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li<sub>2</sub>,\n                    is analogous to the formation of H<sub>2</sub>, but the atomic orbitals involved\n                    are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence\n                    electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the \xcf\x83<sub>2s</sub>\n                    bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding\n                    orbital, we would predict the Li<sub>2</sub> molecule to be stable. The molecule\n                    is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at\n                    temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules\n                    in the table above with a bond order greater than zero are also known.</p>\n                <p>The O<sub>2</sub> molecule has enough electrons to half fill the\n                        (\xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x97<sub>2py</sub>,\xcf\x80\xe2\x88\x97<sub>2pz</sub>) level. We expect the two electrons that\n                    occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular\n                    electronic configuration for O<sub>2</sub> is in accord with the fact that the\n                    oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons, as seen in the energy diagram in the\n                    example below. The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult\n                    to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it\n                    quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a\n                    strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.</p>\n                <example>\n                    <p>Draw the molecular orbital diagram for the oxygen molecule, O<sub>2</sub>.\n                        From this diagram, calculate the bond order for O<sub>2</sub>.
