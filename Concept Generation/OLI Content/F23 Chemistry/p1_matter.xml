Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they\n                    take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also\n                    matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would stay collapsed rather\n                    than inflate when filled with gas.</p>\n\n                <p>Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on\n                    earth.

(In zero gravity,\n                    liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes\n                    that are very nearly independent of pressure.

This can occur when the sample is composed of many small\n                    pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is\n                    composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of\n                    more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to\n                    behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny\n                    particles of water (liquid or solid).</p>\n\n\n                <wb:inline idref="states_dnd_question" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n\n            \n                <p>A fourth state of matter, <extra><anchor>plasma</anchor>\n                    <meaning>\n                        <material>\n                            <p>A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of\n                                electrically charged particles.</p>\n                        </material>\n                    </meaning>\n                </extra>, occurs naturally in the interiors of stars and\n                    other high temperature situations. Like gases, plasmas are less dense than\n                    liquids or solids and do not have a fixed shape or volume. But unlike gases,\n                    plasmas contain significant amounts of electrically charged particles that are\n                    able to move freely. Due to these mobile charged particles, plasmas are very\n                    conductive and highly responsive to external electric or magnetic fields. In\n                    addition to stars, plasmas are found in neon signs, plasma TVs, lightning and\n                    the plasma torch (shown in the image below being used to cut through metal).</p>\n\n                <image src="../webcontent/plasma_torch.png" width="600"\n                    alt="A cutting torch is being used to cut a piece of metal.

One way to\n                    measure an object\xe2\x80\x99s mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the\n                    object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the\n                    car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is\n                    to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.</p>\n\n                <p>Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. <extra>\n                        <anchor>Weight</anchor>\n                        <meaning>\n                            <material>\n                                <p>The force that gravity exerts on an object.</p>\n                            </material>\n                        </meaning>\n                    </extra> refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is\n                    directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes\n                    as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s mass does\n                    not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only\n                    one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon\xe2\x80\x99s gravity is only one-sixth\n                    that of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s. </p>\n            </body>\n\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>The Law of Conservation of Matter</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The <extra>\n                        <anchor>law of conservation of matter</anchor>\n                        <meaning>\n                            <material>\n                                <p>There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when\n                                    matter is converted from one type to another.</p>\n                            </material>\n                        </meaning>\n                    </extra> summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that\n                    there is no change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts\n                    from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or\n                    gaseous states (a physical change). This can be seen in a lead-acid car battery:\n                    The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable\n                    of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and\n                    water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of\n                    matter.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/Conservation_matter.png"\n                    alt="A car battery that contains sheets of P B and P B O subscript 2 along with H subscript 2 S O subscript 4.
