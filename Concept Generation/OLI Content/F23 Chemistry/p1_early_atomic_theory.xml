In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was \n            composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for \xe2\x80\x9cindivisible.\xe2\x80\x9d \n            They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, \n            Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94fire, \n            earth, air, and water\xe2\x80\x94and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and \xe2\x80\x9celements\xe2\x80\x9d \n            as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.</p>\n        <p>The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John \n            Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic \n            theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton\xe2\x80\x99s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern \n            atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton\xe2\x80\x99s atomic theory.</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element that \n                can participate in a chemical change.</li>\n            <li>An element consists of only one type of atom, which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the same for \n                all atoms of that element. A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms, all of which \n                have identical chemical properties.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <image src="../webcontent/penny_atoms.jpg" width="600" alt="The left image shows a photograph of a stack of pennies.

For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken \n            down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither \n            created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one \n            type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).\n        </p>\n        <wb:inline idref="atomic_theory_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n\n'
