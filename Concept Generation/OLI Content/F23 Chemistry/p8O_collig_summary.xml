They include changes in the vapor pressure, boiling\n                point, and freezing point of the solvent in the solution. The magnitudes of these\n                properties depend only on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, not\n                on the type of particles. The total concentration of solute particles in a solution also\n                determines its osmotic pressure. This is the pressure that must be applied to the\n                solution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure solvent through a semipermeable\n                membrane into the solution. Ionic compounds may not completely dissociate in solution\n                due to activity effects, in which case observed colligative effects may be less than\n                predicted.</p></body>\n        </section>\n        \n     \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under  <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
