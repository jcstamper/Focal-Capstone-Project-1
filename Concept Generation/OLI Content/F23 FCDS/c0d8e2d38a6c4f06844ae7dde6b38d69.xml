If you want to predict the number of hospital beds that will be needed in the event of a surge in Ebola cases in the DRC using historic data from past outbreaks, we will assume that there is a linear relationship between the number of hospital beds needed and other variables related to the outbreak, you will fit a linear model on the training data and select the model that minimizes test error. </p><p id="f2e4ff11ef844ba99a9261acfe76588b"><em style="italic">Inference. </em>Instances may arise when you need to understand how your dependent variable Y is affected by changes in independent variables. Your goal is not to make predictions in this case, instead you will estimate <em style="italic">f by</em> making inferences or gaining understanding on the relationship between your independent and dependent variables. You might also be interested in assessing if the relationship between your dependent variable and each independent variable can be explained using a linear equation. </p><p id="edf535f09e834e2d8fdeaa0068194a32"><em>Estimating </em><em><em style="italic">f</em></em></p><p id="c34f8c79a97a4dfdbce3350a3fdfc381">When creating analytic solutions, you encounter the model understanding phase which might include using both linear and non-linear approaches to estimate <em style="italic">f. </em>When estimating <em style="italic">f , </em>you would have gathered a dataset, keeping in mind that the entire dataset will not be used to estimate <em style="italic">f, </em>instead we will use a portion of the dataset to train our model to estimate <em style="italic">f. </em>This dataset is called the <em style="italic">training data set. </em>A statistical method will be applied to the training data to then estimate <em style="italic">f</em>. Typically, you will use one of the following methods for this process:</p><p id="fc7ce8a55c2b4dcd82f04e54e8ee414c"><em style="italic">Parametric Methods</em> assume that your dataset comes from a population that has a fixed set of parameters. <em style="italic">Non-Parametric Methods </em>seek an estimate of <em style="italic">f </em>that is close to the data points. A <em style="italic">thin plate spline</em> can be used to estimate <em style="italic">f</em>. It seeks to estimate <em style="italic">f </em>that is close to the observed data. Thin plate spline is a two-dimensional analog of a spline constructed of piecewise third-order polynomials which pass through a set of control points. A <em style="italic">spline</em> is a piecewise polynomial function that has a simple form locally but can be flexible globally. A <em style="italic">polynomial </em>is a mathematical expression that involves a sum of powers in variables multiplied by coefficients. Non parametric methods include Spearman correlation test and U-test for two independent means. </p><p id="a7d3949885b6448489d85bdb700aa68f">The table below summarizes the differences between the two methods.</p><table id="df108dda75f2483cb04c6c1305a2d9f1" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="ic2e9768ad7434851b3686f57804c4f4d" /><caption><p id="dd88b01b71a04aff8cc006ca5b046dde" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="f0e38c0d407045baaab98a11411063ab"><em>Parametric Methods</em></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="efb0ce29b5eb4ddaa076ccc4a77dfc83"><em>Non-Parametric Methods</em></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ca8e1c6d18984a758800c3c01e8d4cb6">Models are built with a fixed number of parameters.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="c9f5c194cd764c3db7d5f3a9fd058e46">Models are built with any number of parameters.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="e5360934a01343b7865903537c97b95b">It has strong assumptions about data.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="a8485a86349c4dbcac184f8215302ee5">It has fewer assumptions about data.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="bd29f74c15634a54aa1462fdc1e5c3f5">Needs less data than non-parametric methods e.g sign test.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="beb6def639b24e59869e49f8042288ce">Needs significant amount of data.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ee303d4abe19419abc568c8ec13660bc">Possess statistical power.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ac43cc36d6dd48558fc52e60d4dd4f1f">Has less statistical power.</p></td></tr></table><image id="fbdbe7b495ef4ca3b71ee3c5db2b08f5" src="../webcontent/ISLR.jpg" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="297" width="500"><caption><p id="dcdb4c6ac11b43c087871abb2cb75520"><em style="italic">Source: ISLR</em><em style="italic"><sup>1</sup></em><em style="italic">.

Take a look at the figure above, you will see that if you are interested in inference, a restrictive linear model that shows the relationship between your dependent variable (Y) and independent variables will be the best choice for estimating <em style="italic">f. </em>A generalized additive model (GAM) will extend a linear model to encompass non-linear relationships, making GAMs more flexible. Methods that are more flexible tend to allow for non-linear relationships and they have low interpretability than your less flexible methods. When prediction is the task of interest, flexibility is key and because interpretability is not a high concern, you can use the methods with less interpretability.</p><p id="d0c68c58c7db4407b7eab0d57b634683">Using a method with low interpretability is not the only route to take when pursuing a prediction task. This process of selecting the right method for a data science modeling task can be quite daunting but we will be exploring the different types of selection techniques throughout Unit 5. Going forward, we will discuss the different data science patterns and the methods that are used to estimate <em style="italic">f</em>.  You will also learn about the criteria that is used to select the best model.</p><wb:inline idref="newebd006dd9f56449f830b4d2ac744367e" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
