There are some non-graphical techniques that are used to explore data and as well as graphical techniques. Non-graphical techniques include using summary statistics to describe the data and the graphical techniques are used to describe the frequency distribution of the dataset. Both techniques can be used to show the skewness and extreme outliers in a dataset.</p><p id="d1609aa30f2744e7be62f6d5b69ae34a"><em>Summarizing Data</em></p><p id="ed8f19bfd33c4669a7ec6b40fad284c8">Summarizing data is dependent on the types of data present in your dataset. When you want to understand the observed data a.k.a your sample, you will key descriptors of a dataset. When you have a large data set, it is difficult to describe it in its raw form. You will use specific techniques to summarize and describe your sample. Some of those techniques include <em style="italic">Describing Central Tendency and Assessing Measures of Spread and Relationships. </em></p><p id="cc37bbf6d0f143de8fd0bd09f1b78bed">You can use the location, shape and spread of the data in a dataset to understand the data. You might find some of the concepts below as a review of your first Statistics course, but pay attention to the reason for using these techniques in exploring your data. Also, these concepts are important for when you learn about using statistical inference to draw conclusions on an unknown population parameter.</p><p id="cff9fa5e23fb4b278dcf6a22058ed8a0"><em>Location. </em>During the EDA process, we are looking to describe our data using a central value. We will explore the <em style="italic">Mean </em>which is sometimes called the average, this is the sum total of all observations divided by the number of observations. You will calculate the mean for your population (population mean = μ)  and for the sample that you have drawn (sample mean = x̄). There are different types of mean including the typical arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and the harmonic mean.</p><p id="ea82bc2f69e14fdbb25936f8c834915b"><em>Reading: </em><link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency" target="new" internal="false">Central Tendency with Different Types of Means</link>.</p><p id="fb9753a01d7e427bba00c61c7de11d60"><em style="italic">Median </em>is the mid value of a dataset. To calculate a median value, you will sort your data in ascending order. The median value in a data set with odd number of observations is the middle value, while you can find the median of a dataset with even observations by calculating the average of the two middle values.</p><p id="d8230587aaee409e9b430d408f376f52"><em style="italic"><em>**Do you know that if the mean and median of your data set differ greatly, you should check that variable for outliers!**</em></em></p><p id="d257e1706b81410cb8faf18d1af82401"><em style="italic">Mode </em>is the variable of an observation that most frequently occurs in your dataset. A uni-modal variable is one that has just one mode and a bimodal variable has two modes. If your variable has more than two modes, it can be referred to as multi-modal. Do not think it is useless in the EDA process, the mode is quite useful when summarizing categorical variables. </p><p id="d68fd6c3960e46c18618797a0190f7e3"> <em style="italic">Percentile. </em>You will remember this nifty word from your GRE scores or height and weight data from your health records. It tells you the position of a value in your dataset.  If you are 175cm in height and you are in the 10th percentile of height measurement for your gender, it means that among all the height data collected for your gender, you are taller than 10% of those observations. The 50th percentile is considered the median. <em style="italic">Quartiles </em>are values that split the data into quarters.</p><p id="d31562923eaa4d70a56ceba806a85ed2"><em>Spread. </em>How can you describe the spread or variability of your dataset? You use the measures of dispersion. Although used for descriptive statistics, you must be careful in relying on this measure to describe variability.</p><p id="dcf6f222358140b6847e39e91a142ec8"><em style="italic">Range </em>of a set of values can be calculated by subtracting the minimum value in your dataset from the maximum value. Notice that range only considers two values and ignores all other values of a variable.</p><p id="ab3127b228544d3d893da2a7edce698d"><em style="italic">Mean Absolute Deviation </em>is the &quot;average distance between each value and the mean of a dataset&quot;. This measure of dispersion can tell you how values are spread out in a dataset and determines whether the mean is a useful indicator of the values within the data. The larger the mean absolute deviation, the more spread out the data. When you work with time series forecasting methods, you will use the mean absolute deviation to measure the performance of a forecasting model. You will find that the measures used in EDA are often used in model selection criteria.</p><p id="cd715fa5607b42869993d2014e1b266c"><em>Reading</em>: <link href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/other-measures-of-spread/a/mean-absolute-deviation-mad-review" target="new" internal="false">Mean Deviation</link> =  (Σ|x − μ|)/N. This is the sum of the absolute values minus the mean and divide this by the number of values in the dataset. </p><p id="a542fe70bc9e4b2a8e9f054d9ddf551d"><em style="italic">Variance s</em><em style="italic"><sup>2 </sup></em><em style="italic">/ σ</em><em style="italic"><sup>2</sup></em><em style="italic"> </em>is the average of the squared difference between the observations in a dataset and the mean. So far, we know that you can have measures for both your overall population and your sample drawn from the population. Keep in mind that you will sometimes have a sample variance <em style="italic">s</em><em style="italic"><sup>2 </sup></em> or a population variance <em style="italic">σ</em><em style="italic"><sup>2</sup></em><em style="italic">. </em>The difference between both is that you are looking at the spread of data from the sample mean versus the population mean. </p><p id="c717a052b48e419abaccd45998d88f71"><em style="italic">Standard deviation σ or s </em>is the most common measure of dispersion, it tells you the distance of the values from the mean in your dataset. A low standard deviation tells you that the values are close to the mean and a high standard deviation means there is a spread. The σ is derived by calculating the square root of the variance. As you perform exploratory data analysis and even while developing models, the importance of the standard deviation can not be overstated. Despite its mention as a way to summarize data, standard deviation is used to &quot;measure the confidence in statistical conclusions&quot; and if you remember from the overview of this Unit, you will be conducting statistical inference to begin to draw some conclusions on your data and hypotheses.</p><p id="a9ab5352d3c747d1b66f7d1362d2fb69"><em style="italic">Interquartile Range (IQR) </em>similar to the range, does not consider all observations when looking at the spread of values in a dataset. IQR describes 50% of values in your dataset when arranged in ascending order. The IQR is the difference between the values in Quartile 3 and the values in Quartile 1. You can use this measure to identify a value that is an <em style="italic">outlier</em>. </p><p id="d61a652ada684bc7ab30f440185470fb"><em>Shape. </em>Now that you can explain the measures used to explore data by describing its central value, its spread from the mean, and identified outliers, let us describe the distribution of a dataset and assess whether it is normally distributed. Normally distributed data is useful when making statistical inferences. How can we assess the distribution of our data:</p><p id="c9aba08b3ffe4c8691b690b86cca3db1"><em style="italic">Skewness </em>measures the degree to which the distribution of data lacks symmetry. A dataset with <em>0 </em>skewness is considered normally distributed. Data does not always have a skewness of 0; however, if you have found skewness to be between -0.5 and 0.5, you can ascertain that your data is symmetrical. If skewness is between -1 and -0.5 or 0.5 and 1, then your data is moderately skewed. If skewness is &lt; -1 or &gt; 1, your data is highly skewed. </p><image id="f48d648eea024f09a53681a8a5df0d83" src="../webcontent/Symmetrical_Data_set.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle"><caption><p id="cb0afcf071334be4ba973830ca04d091"><em style="italic">Source: BPI Consulting LLC</em></p></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="ab2a74de16234005832d83a7e161a3b9"><em style="italic">Kurtosis </em>looks at the outliers within the distribution. This measure of shape will describe the distribution of data by showing whether the tails of the distribution are more or less extreme than the normal distribution. </p><p id="f1fed673dc30434b998501348aa518df"><em>Reading</em>: <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis" target="new" internal="false">Kurtosis</link></p><p id="c38bdad9afb143aeb1aa6ddf78b8e3b5"><em>Relationships and Association</em></p><p id="d263c6d02ef74e47a863b6bf8a2b6673"><em style="italic">Covariance </em>describes the linear relationship between variables in your sample or population data. Covariance can be negative ,meaning your variables have a negative linear relationship, zero (0) meaning the variables have no linear relationship, or positive meaning a positive linear relationship exists between the variables. </p><p id="e00df8d821b743dba596d890c390f59a"><em style="italic">Correlation Coefficient </em>will describe the strength of the linear relationship between the variables x <em style="italic">and </em>y. It is a different measure than covariance because it describes both the direction and strength of the linear relationship between the variables. If the correlation coefficient equals:</p><table id="c6a39fd1490b4f079fe765d75a471be2" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="ia14e6b134cb04edb9b830a6d1e974cf7" /><caption><p id="b1483e5c951b46afa7a4ae38a4b1a840" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="f71f31e86228478185e494ee5219d218"><em>Correlation Coefficient</em></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="a4724e2f795f40acbcef0cfbfa02a2a8"><em>Meaning</em></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="fa81d79004904e62976a020103c23a35">-1</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="db0ecba4020149ff9f0071c0305ea809">Variables have a perfect negative linear relationship.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="e1acb45d99c64b31bab328a944c7fc45">0</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="b4b15bb0ce6b4d9fa6874448bebf6d5c">Variables are <em>not</em> linearly related.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="c7b74db49c844193b23b6ba145ef8db3">1</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="a5e8c17f9d6c49fda7102f9ae101f56b">Variables have a perfect positive linear relationship.</p></td></tr></table><p id="ddf8fc66ac254116976cbed3e5586b92"><em>Outliers</em></p><p id="e968fe38b25f44278b0c4016de549ae5">Whenever you have a rather small or large observation within your dataset compared to other values in the dataset, this is called <em style="italic">an outlier. </em>Outliers will affect the performance of your model and prior to getting to that point, your exploratory data analysis. When you have a large dataset, the outliers are not as noticeable as when you have a smaller dataset. Similar to missing values, you must handle outliers when you identify them in your dataset. You should refrain from removing them from the dataset until proper investigation is completed. You can &quot;handle&quot; outliers by following these steps:</p><p id="a4a8ec0303e846018b1b671763d92a5b"><link href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/boxplots.html" target="new" internal="false"><em style="italic">Construct a Boxplot</em></link> or as it is sometimes called, a box and whisker plot. This chart is used to graph the five number summary. The five number summary is used to identify an outlier in your dataset. A five-number summary consists of five values including the the maximum and minimum values in your dataset, the lower and upper quartiles, and the median. These values are then ordered in ascending order and plotted. </p><p id="fec8cec4765a471f89d6314637abbf83">Box plots provide a visual summary of the data so that data scientists and analysts can identify outliers and other summary statistics including the skewness and mean. You will typically plot your box plot using a tool of your choice, in this course that would be python.

If an observation has a z-score that is more than 3 or less than -3, it is an outlier! </p><p id="e582340a21a347b2a851ff269457d302"><em>Graphical Summaries</em></p><p id="eb027f83d52240228d9c710f28b31abf">The saying that a picture tells a thousand words supports the notion that visualizing data is one of the best ways to tell a story to a wide audience with the ability to view the visuals. Today, there are so many tools that are used to visualize data including Python, R, Excel, Tableau, Microsoft&apos;s PowerBI among others. These tools even allow us to make data visualizations interactive for more effective analysis. Rene Descartes invented the Cartesian coordinate system or the X and Y axis graph as we know it. </p><image id="c690e7fc47e84cbcbdab22e9212fddf7" src="../webcontent/Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="464" width="500"><caption><p id="aff1108a55d84a6dad30dcbb87059e53"><em style="italic">One of the first Cartesian Coordinates Graphs</em></p></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="b42c1c2ad7644edb8bf86fac7c9cc55b">Data visualizations have evolved greatly. Including info-graphics, plots, and statistical graphs. Communicating insights in the data clearly is a key step in the data science process. There is a skill to developing effective visualizations and not all data scientists will have these skills, however it is important to know how to use the tools that support visualization and be able to identify the right types of visualizations for the data types, and the best ways to tell your story with visualizations. Visualization experts strongly suggest that visualizations should stimulate the attention of viewers and elicit thoughts and questions. During the data science project process, visualizations will be used at different times. At this stage of exploratory data analysis, the visualizations are used to understand the dataset as you proceed through analytic solution building. Gaining a better understanding of your data will support the performance of your models in the later stages of the project. </p><p id="bbb718815b1247f5bfcdba1bbe65ddb5"><em>Visualizing Variables</em></p><p id="c0ee620c69ef49c2850fb06eb457d831">So far, we have talked about visualizing mostly numeric data, however we are able to visualize categorical data as well. Typically, this data is categorized and numeric values are derived (counted) to represent the values in the variables. A frequency distribution is a useful technique in displaying categorical variables. </p><p id="bb1314dc1e4e402eaace3243382314f7">Follow our primer below to learn more about the appropriate visualizations for data science tasks.</p><p id="e99753c83f034428a8cc12f63022fa8d"><em>Reading: </em><link href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/clouddatascience.blob.core.windows.net/m20-foundation-data-science/p2-data-visualization-primer/data_visualization_primer.ipynb" target="new" internal="false"><em>Data Exploration and Visualization Primer</em></link><em>.</em></p><p id="aba0d3dd4adb4bde86ad92ea227d5769">As we study exploratory data analysis, we will learn how to describe sample data by making inferences from the population on which the sample data was drawn.
