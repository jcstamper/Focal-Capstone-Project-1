This radiation\n                    shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, \xce\xbd, and a\n                    wavelength, \xce\xbb, such that c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through\n                    two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the\n                    wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive\n                    and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also\n                    demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is\n                    related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as\n                    E = h\xce\xbd (or E = hc/\xce\xbb ), where h is Planck\'s constant. That light demonstrates\n                    both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All\n                    forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various\n                    forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact\n                    differently with matter and have very different practical applications.</p>\n                <p>Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies,\n                    such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent\n                    sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). The\n                    line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from an\n                    electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple\n                    enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived\n                    from the spectrum.</p>\n                <p>Bohr incorporated Planck\xe2\x80\x99s and Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s quantization ideas into a model of the\n                    hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra.\n                    The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the\n                    quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described\n                    the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a\n                    nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits\n                    characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits\n                    result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a\n                    higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a\n                    photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon\n                    of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of\n                    an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        \n       \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\n                License</link>. </p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312</link>.</p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
