Kinetic energy (KE)\n                is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position,\n                composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy\n                is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of\n                thermodynamics).</p>\n                <p> The total of all energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (<em style="italic">E</em>). As a\n                    system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred\n                    from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. The change\n                    in internal energy of a system can be determined from the equation \xce\x94<em style="italic"\n                        >E</em> = <em style="italic">q</em> + <em style="italic">w</em>. When the work done\n                    by or on the system is pressure-volume work, the change in internal energy is calculated\n                    using the equation: \xce\x94<em style="italic">E</em> = <em style="italic">q</em> \xe2\x88\x92 <em\n                        style="italic">P</em>\xce\x94<em style="italic">V</em>. </p></body>\n        </section>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
