Ionic bonds differ from covalent bonds in that ionic bonds involve one or\n                    more electrons being transferred from one atom to another rather than being\n                    shared between the two atoms. This type of bonding is observed between pairs of\n                    atoms that have a large electronegativity difference, like the alkali metals in\n                    the first column of the periodic table and the halogens, in group 17. The low\n                    electronegativity atom gives one or more electrons to the high electronegativity\n                    atom. This results in a positively charged cation and a negatively charged\n                    anion. In the image below we can see that atoms\xe2\x80\x99 electronegativity increases\n                    from a minimum at the bottom left of the periodic table to a maximum at the top\n                    right (excluding the noble gases).</p>\n\n                <image src="../webcontent/pt_electro.jpg"\n                    alt="Part of the periodic table is shown.

As radii of ions decrease the attractive forces increase and therefore\n                    boiling points increase.

As the magnitude of charges of the ions within an ionic compounds\n                    increase, the lattice energy increases and likewise the attractive force between\n                    the ions and the boiling point of the compound will increase. For example, NaF\n                    and CaO have distances between their nuclei of 1.18 \xc3\x85 and 1.20 \xc3\x85 , respectively.\n                    With a very small difference in the sizes, we might expect their boiling points\n                    to be likewise close in value. However, the boiling point of CaO is\n                    significantly larger at 2850 <sup>o</sup>C compared to that of NaF at 1695\n                        <sup>o</sup>C. This is due to the charges of the ions; CaO with charges of\n                    +2 and -2, while NaF has charges of +1 and -1. It is also important to note that\n                    the magnitude of charge generally has a more significant impact on boiling point\n                    compared to the size of ions.
