However,\n            under certain circumstances atoms can become electrically charged. When an atom becomes\n            electrically charged it is called an <extra><anchor>ion</anchor><meaning><material><p>An atom that has gained or lost electrons and therefore is electrically charged.</p></material></meaning></extra>. As will be discussed in more detail later in\n            this unit, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing\n            electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and\n            is called an <extra><anchor>anion</anchor><meaning><material><p>A negatively charged ion.</p></material></meaning></extra>. Positively charged atoms called <extra><anchor>cations</anchor><meaning><material><p>A positively charged ion.</p></material></meaning></extra> are formed when an atom\n            loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11\n            electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11\n            \xe2\x88\x92 10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two\n            electrons it will become an anion with a 2\xe2\x88\x92 charge (8 \xe2\x88\x92 10 = 2\xe2\x88\x92).</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/Mg_charge.png" width="600"\n            alt="Symbol for magnesium that shows the mass number atomic number and charge of ion.
