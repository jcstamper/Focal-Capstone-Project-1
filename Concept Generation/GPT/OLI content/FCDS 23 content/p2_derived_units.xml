For example, we can use the base\n            quantity of length to define volume, and the base quantities of mass and length to\n            define density.</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Volume</title>\n            <body>\n                <p><extra>\n                        <anchor>Volume</anchor>\n                        <meaning>\n                            <material>\n                                <p>amount of space occupied by an object.</p>\n                            </material>\n                        </meaning>\n                    </extra> is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The\n                    standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length. The standard\n                    volume is a cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>), a cube with an edge length of exactly\n                    one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with\n                    edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or\n                    any other substance.</p>\n                <p>A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10\n                    cm). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one\n                    cubic decimeter (dm<sup>3</sup>). A liter (L) is the more common name for the\n                    cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.</p>\n                <p>A cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup>) is the volume of a cube with an edge length\n                    of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often\n                    used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is also called a milliliter\n                    (mL) and is 1/1000 of a liter.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/volume.jpg" width="600"\n                    alt="Figure A shows a large cube, which has a volume of 1 meter cubed. This larger cube is made up of many smaller cubes in a 10 by 10 pattern. Each of these smaller cubes has a volume of 1 decimeter cubed, or one liter. Each of these smaller cubes is, in turn, made up of many tiny cubes. Each of these tiny cubes has a volume of 1 centimeter cubed, or one milliliter. A one cubic centimeter cube is about the same width as a dime, which has a width of 1.8 centimeter.">\n                    <caption> (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of 1 m<sup>3</sup>, 1\n                            dm<sup>3</sup> (1 L), and 1 cm<sup>3</sup> (1 mL) (not to scale).

Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and\n                    length.</p>\n                <p>The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance\n                    to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter\n                        (kg/m<sup>3</sup>). For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient\n                    unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) or grams per milliliter (g/mL)\n                    for the\n                    densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. Although\n                    there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from\n                    about 0.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (the\n                    density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L.
