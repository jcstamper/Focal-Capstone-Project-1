The engines of\n            these rockets rely on carefully prepared solid mixtures of chemicals combined in\n            precisely measured amounts. Igniting the mixture initiates a vigorous chemical reaction\n            that rapidly generates large amounts of gaseous products. These gases are ejected from\n            the rocket engine through its nozzle, providing the thrust needed to propel heavy\n            payloads into space. Both the nature of this chemical reaction and the relationships\n            between the amounts of the substances being consumed and produced by the reaction are\n            critically important considerations that determine the success of the technology. This\n            unit will describe how to symbolize chemical reactions using chemical equations, how to\n            classify some common chemical reactions by identifying patterns of reactivity, and how\n            to determine the quantitative relations between the amounts of substances involved in\n            chemical reactions\xe2\x80\x94that is, the reaction stoichiometry.</p>\n        \n        <p>Adapted from<link\n            href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface">Openstax\n            Chemistry</link>under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons\n                Attribution 4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
