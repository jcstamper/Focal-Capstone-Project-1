These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of\n            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying\n            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the\n            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which\n            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different\n            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the\n            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class\n            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate\n            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a\n            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small\n            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.</p>\n        <image id="ee76fbf4ae074e71bb3bcf5b2cc9c5dd" src="../webcontent/U9M3_Colloids.jpg"\n            alt="This figure contains three photos and corresponding particle diagrams.

Gelatin, glue, starch,\n            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal\n            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are\n            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a\n            liquid in air. </p>\n        <p id="d819a9b412d341ee9451e28bbfad5e9a">An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or\n            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,\n            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be\n            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an\n            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large\n            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying\n            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a\n            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of\n            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise\n            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents. </p>\n        <p id="c8898e7cd4bf48b78370a4d553ffd0f3">Condensation methods form colloidal particles by\n            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,\n            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water\n            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce\n            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they\n            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow.
