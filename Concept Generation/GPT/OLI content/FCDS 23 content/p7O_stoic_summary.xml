Coefficients from\n                    the equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that subsequently may be\n                    used for computations relating reactant and product masses, molar amounts, and\n                    other quantitative properties.</p>\n                \n                <p>When reactions are carried out using less-than-stoichiometric quantities of\n                    reactants, the amount of product generated will be determined by the limiting\n                    reactant. The amount of product generated by a chemical reaction is its actual\n                    yield. This yield is often less than the amount of product predicted by the\n                    stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation representing the reaction (its\n                    theoretical yield). The extent to which a reaction generates the theoretical\n                    amount of product is expressed as its percent yield.</p>\n                \n                <p>The stoichiometry of chemical reactions may serve as the basis for quantitative\n                    chemical analysis methods. Titrations involve measuring the volume of a titrant\n                    solution required to completely react with a sample solution. This volume is\n                    then used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the sample using the\n                    stoichiometry of the titration reaction. </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <p>Adapted from <link\n            href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"> Openstax\n            Chemistry</link>under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons\n                Attribution 4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
