The transfer\n            and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements.

That is, group 1 elements form 1+\n            ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on\n            the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the\n            number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one\n            group left of the noble gases) form 1\xe2\x88\x92 ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2\xe2\x88\x92\n            ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive\n            value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition\n            metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by\n            their location in the table. For example, copper can form ions with a 1+ or 2+ charge,\n            and iron can form ions with a 2+ or 3+ charge.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/periodic_table_ions.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="Group one of the periodic table contains L i superscript plus sign in period 2, N a superscript plus sign in period 3, K superscript plus sign in period 4, R b superscript plus sign in period 5, C s superscript plus sign in period 6, and F r superscript plus sign in period 7.
