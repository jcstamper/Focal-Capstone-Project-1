Covalent\n                    radius increases as we move down a group because the n level (orbital size)\n                    increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a\n                    period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons\n                    increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii\n                    are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the\n                    number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained\n                    constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation)\n                    decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier\n                    to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity\n                    (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic)\n                    when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus.\n                    Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to\n                    right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group. For both\n                    IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends when dealing\n                    with completely filled or half-filled subshells.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n       \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\n                License</link>. </p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312</link>.</p>\n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
