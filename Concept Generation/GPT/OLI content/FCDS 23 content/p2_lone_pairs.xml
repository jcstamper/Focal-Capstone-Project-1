The ideal bond angles in a trigonal\n            pyramidal shape are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are\n            slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than\n            do bonding electrons. The H\xe2\x80\x93N\xe2\x80\x93H bond angles in NH3 are slightly smaller than the 109.5\xc2\xb0\n            angle in a regular tetrahedral shape such as that of CH4 because the lone pair-bonding\n            pair repulsion is greater than the bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/lone_pairs1.png"\n            alt="Three images are shown and labeled, \xe2\x80\x9ca,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cb,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cc.\xe2\x80\x9d Image a shows a nitrogen atom single bonded to three hydrogen atoms.

VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by\n            establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by\n            different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest\n            to least repulsion is:</p>\n        <p>lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/lone_pairs2.png"\n            alt="diagram showing repulsion of bonding and non-bonding pairs of electrons">\n            <caption>Repulsion between two lone pairs of electrons is greater than between a lone\n                pair and a bonded pair, which is greater than the repulsion between two bonded pairs\n                of electrons.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of\n            electrons. A lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons\n            in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy more space than those in a\n            double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is:</p>\n\n        <p>lone pair > triple bond > double bond > single bond</p>\n        <p>Consider formaldehyde, H<sub>2</sub>CO, which is used as a preservative for biological\n            and anatomical specimens (Figure). This molecule has regions of high electron density\n            that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal\n            planar with 120\xc2\xb0 bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger\n            angles (121\xc2\xb0), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118\xc2\xb0).</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/formaldahyde.PNG" width="700"\n            alt="A pair of images are shown.

For a particular number of electron\n                pairs (row), the molecular structures for one or more lone pairs are determined\n                based on modifications of the corresponding electron-pair geometry.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in the table above) are\n            equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries\n            (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone\n            pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal\n            electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in\n            diagram below: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two\n            axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial\n            position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). The axial\n            position is surrounded by bond angles of 90\xc2\xb0, whereas the equatorial position has more\n            space available because of the 120\xc2\xb0 bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair\n            geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious\n            positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs. Theoretically, we can come\n            up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF3\n            molecule. The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial\n            locations, giving a T-shaped molecular structure.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/lone_pairs5.jpg" width="700"\n            alt="Four sets of images are shown and labeled, \xe2\x80\x9ca,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cb,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cc,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cd.\xe2\x80\x9d Each image is separated by a dashed vertical line.
