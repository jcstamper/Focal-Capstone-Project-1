When the orbitals overlap along an\n                    axis containing the nuclei, they form a \xcf\x83 bond. When they overlap in a fashion\n                    that creates a node along this axis, they form a \xcf\x80 bond.</p>\n                <p>We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of\n                    the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently\n                    bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (\xcf\x83) bonds directed toward\n                    other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine\n                    the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions\n                    of electron density about it. Two such regions imply sp hybridization; three,\n                    sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization; four, sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization; five, sp<sup>3</sup>d\n                    hybridization; and six, sp<sup>3</sup>d<sup>2</sup> hybridization. Pi (\xcf\x80) bonds\n                    are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals).</p>\n                <p>Multiple bonds consist of a \xcf\x83 bond located along the axis between two atoms and\n                    one or two \xcf\x80 bonds. The \xcf\x83 bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized\n                    atomic orbitals, while the \xcf\x80 bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of\n                    unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized\n                    orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of \xcf\x80 bonds\n                    can vary.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n       \n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
