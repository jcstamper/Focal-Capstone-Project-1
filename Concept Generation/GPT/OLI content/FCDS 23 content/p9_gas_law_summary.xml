The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to\n            its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Gay-Lussac\'s law).\n            The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at\n            constant pressure (Charles\xe2\x80\x99s law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely\n            proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s law). Under the\n            same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same\n            number of molecules (Avogadro\xe2\x80\x99s law).</p>\n        <p>The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, <em\n                style="italic">PV</em> = <em style="italic">nRT</em>, where <em style="italic"\n                >P</em> is the pressure of the gas, <em style="italic">V</em> is its volume, <em style="italic">n</em> is the number of moles of the\n            gas, <em style="italic">T</em> is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the learning\n                    objectives for the <em style="italic">Gas Laws</em> module and use the <em\n                        style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might\n                    have about the material that you would like the instructor to address.
