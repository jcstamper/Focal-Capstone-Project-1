Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater\n            concentration, in which case it is called the solvent. The other components of the\n            solution present in relatively lesser concentrations are called solutes. Sugar is a\n            covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules,\n            C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>. When this compound dissolves in water, its\n            molecules become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water:</p>\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm C}_{12}{\\mathrm H}_{22}{\\mathrm\n            O}_{11}(s)\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;{\\mathrm C}_{12}{\\mathrm H}_{22}{\\mathrm\n            O}_{11}(aq)$$</formula>\n        <p>The \xe2\x80\x9caq\xe2\x80\x9d in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are\n            therefore individually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent).\n            Although sucrose molecules are heavier than water molecules, they remain dispersed\n            throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to \xe2\x80\x9csettle out\xe2\x80\x9d over time.</p>\n        <p>Potassium dichromate, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, is an ionic compound\n            composed of colorless potassium ions, K<sup>+</sup>, and orange dichromate ions,\n                Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2\xe2\x88\x92</sup>. When a small amount of solid potassium\n            dichromate is added to water, the compound dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium\n            ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed throughout the mixture (seen below), as\n            indicated in this equation:</p>\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm K}_2{\\mathrm{Cr}}_2{\\mathrm O}_7(s)\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;2\\;\\mathrm\n            K^+(aq)\\;+\\;{\\mathrm{Cr}}_2{\\mathrm O}_7^{2-}(aq)$$</formula>\n        <p>As with the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its\n            solutes, potassium and dichromate ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent\n            (water) molecules.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_01_K2Cr2O7_1.jpg" alt="The first photo shows a small mound of an orange crystalline solid.

However, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent.\n            Many alloys are solid solutions of one metal dissolved in another; for example, US\n            five-cent coins contain nickel dissolved in copper. Air is a gaseous solution, a\n            homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and several other gases. Oxygen (a gas),\n            alcohol (a liquid), and sugar (a solid) all dissolve in water (a liquid) to form liquid\n            solutions. The table below gives examples of several different solutions and the phases\n            of the solutes and solvents.</p>\n        <table>\n            <title>Different Types of Solutions</title>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Solution</th>\n                <th>Solute</th>\n                <th>Solvent</th>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>air</td>\n                <td>O<sub>2</sub>(g)</td>\n                <td>N<sub>2</sub>(g)</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>soft drinks</td>\n                <td>CO<sub>2</sub>(g)</td>\n                <td>H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td> hydrogen in palladium</td>\n                <td>H<sub>2</sub>(g)</td>\n                <td>Pd(s)</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>rubbing alcohol</td>\n                <td>H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</td>\n                <td>C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O(l) (2-propanol)</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>saltwater</td>\n                <td>NaCl(s)</td>\n                <td>H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>brass</td>\n                <td>Zn(s)</td>\n                <td>Cu(s)</td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p><em>Solutions exhibit these defining traits:</em></p>\n        <ul>\n            \n            <li>They are homogeneous; that is, after a solution is mixed, it has the same\n                composition at all points throughout (its composition is uniform).</li>\n            <li>The physical state of a solution\xe2\x80\x94solid, liquid, or gas\xe2\x80\x94is typically the same as that\n                of the solvent, as demonstrated by the examples in the table above.</li>\n            <li>The components of a solution are dispersed on a molecular scale; that is, they\n                consist of a mixture of separated molecules, atoms, and/or ions.</li>\n            <li>The dissolved solute in a solution will not settle out or separate from the\n                solvent.</li>\n            <li>The composition of a solution, or the concentrations of its components, can be\n                varied continuously, within limits.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <wb:inline idref="solutions_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under  <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
