So understanding wave\n            characteristics is important in understanding electromagnetic energy. A wave is an\n            oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to\n            another. Common examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers\n            energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes\n            waves to ripple outward along the water\'s surface, and the expansion of air that\n            accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward\n            for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter\n            (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. </p>\n        <p>Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. Electromagnetic waves consist of\n            an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which\n            are perpendicular to the direction of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at\n            a constant speed of \\(2.998\\times10^8\\) m/s, the speed of light (denoted by <em style="italic">c</em>).</p>\n        <p>All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by: a\n            wavelength (denoted by <em style="italic">\xce\xbb</em>, the lowercase Greek letter lambda); a frequency (denoted by <em style="italic">\xce\xbd</em>,\n            the lowercase Greek letter nu); and an amplitude (denoted by <em style="italic">A</em>). As can be seen in diagrams below, the\n            wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured\n            in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an\n            enormous range - wavelengths of kilometers (10<sup>3</sup> m) to picometers\n            (10<sup>-12</sup> m) have been observed. The frequency (the rate of oscillation) is the number of wave cycles\n            that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system,\n            time is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit\n            for frequency, expressed as cycles per second (s<sup>\xe2\x88\x921</sup>), is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples\n            of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = \\(1\\times10^6\\) Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = \\(1\\times10^9\\)\n            Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave\'s\n            displacement and so, as shown in the figure below, this corresponds to one-half the height between the\n            peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for\n            light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness. Brighter lights have a greater amplitude than dimmer lights and louder sounds have a greater amplitude than quieter sounds.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/new_waves.PNG" width="600"\n            alt="This figure includes 5 one-dimensional sinusoidal waves in two columns.

In the second column, the two waves are similarly shown, but lack the lambda labels. The top wave in this column has a greater vertical distance between the peaks and troughs and is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cHigher amplitude.\xe2\x80\x9d The wave beneath it has a lesser distance between the peaks and troughs and is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cLower amplitude.\xe2\x80\x9d">\n            <caption>One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength,\n                frequency, and speed.

The inverse proportionality is illustrated in figure below. This\n            figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of\n            electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific\n            frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light\n            makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies\n            developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for\n            reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for\n            different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as\n            frequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified\n            in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms).</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/wavelength_frequency_diagram.png" width="600"\n            alt="The figure includes a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum which extends from gamma radiation at the far left through x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, terahertz, and microwave to broadcast and wireless radio at the far right.

Between the ultraviolet and infrared labels is a narrow band of violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red colors in narrow, vertical strips. From this narrow band, two dashed lines extend a short distance above to the left and right of an image of the visible spectrum.
