This allows each\n                    halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main\n                    group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons (or 2 valence\n                    electrons in the 1st shell) is known as the octet rule, as discussed\n                    previously.</p>\n                <p>The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number\n                    of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is\n                    especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C,\n                    N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in\n                    its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an\n                    octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as\n                    illustrated here for carbon in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH4\n                    (silane). Hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, which is\n                    the first shell. It has one valence electron so it forms one covalent bond to\n                    obtain the noble gas configuration of helium.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/ccl4.jpg"\n                    alt="Two sets of Lewis dot structures are shown.
