The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo\n            metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a\n            variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation,\n            heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous\n            amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then\n            used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers,\n            and bridges.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/thermo_intro1.jpg" alt="Three pictures are shown and labeled a, b, and c. Picture a is a cheeseburger. Picture b depicts a highway that is full of traffic. Picture c is a view into an industrial metal furnace. The view into the furnace shows a hot fire burning inside." width="700">\n            <caption>The energy involved in chemical changes is important to our daily lives: (a) A\n                cheeseburger for lunch provides the energy you need to get through the rest of the\n                day; (b) the combustion of gasoline provides the energy that moves your car (and\n                you) between home, work, and school; and (c) coke, a processed form of coal,\n                provides the energy needed to convert iron ore into iron, which is essential for\n                making many of the products we use daily.

Every day, the sun provides\n            the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the\n            world\xe2\x80\x99s energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store\n            incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are\n            both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through\n            photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant\n            products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that\n            comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants.\n            Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized\n            plant and animal matter.</p>\n        <p>This unit will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with\n            the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changes\xe2\x80\x94an area\n            called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in this unit are widely used in almost\n            all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy\n            content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the\n            metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and\n            transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find\n            better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive\n            to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate\n            our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics,\n            among other applications. Understanding thermochemical principles is essential for\n            chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about\n            anyone who studies or does any kind of science.</p>\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
