When a naturally occurring element is\n                    composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the\n                    average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the\n                    atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, or two-letter \n                    abbreviations for the atoms.</p>\n                <p>A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact\n                    numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives\n                    the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula\n                    indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick\n                    and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule.\n                    Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements\n                    of atoms.</p>\n                <p>The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements\n                    led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged\n                    in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known\n                    as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar\n                    chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and\n                    nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition\n                    metals. Groups are numbered 1\xe2\x80\x9318 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are\n                    known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals;\n                    those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are\n                    the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.</p>\n                <p>Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of\n                    electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the\n                    preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged\n                    ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and,\n                    to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed\n                    to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in\n                    the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively\n                    charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions.\n                    Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic\n                    (containing more than one atom).</p>\n                <p>Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally\n                    form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead\n                    consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms\n                    that behave as a single unit), are called covalent or molecular compounds. Covalent compounds\n                    usually form from two nonmetals.</p>\n                <p>Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular\n                    compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds\n                    typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written\n                    first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to \xe2\x80\x93ide. For\n                    example, K<sub>2</sub>O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions\n                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the\n                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl<sub>2</sub> is iron(II) chloride and\n                        FeCl<sub>3</sub> is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic\n                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular\n                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so\n                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule\n                    of the compound. Examples include SF<sub>6</sub>, sulfur hexafluoride, and\n                        N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important\n                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.\n                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the \xe2\x80\x93ide suffix to \xe2\x80\x93ic,\n                    and adding \xe2\x80\x9cacid;\xe2\x80\x9d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the\n                    ending of the anion to \xe2\x80\x93ic, and adding \xe2\x80\x9cacid;\xe2\x80\x9d H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is\n                    carbonic acid.</p>\n\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Elements and Compounds</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
