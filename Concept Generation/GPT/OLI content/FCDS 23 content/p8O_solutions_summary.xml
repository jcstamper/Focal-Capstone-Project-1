The solvent is the most concentrated component\n                    and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components\n                    typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form\n                    endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and\n                    solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable\n                    change in energy.</p>\n                <p>Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may\n                    be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,\n                    acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their\n                    constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is\n                    facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar\n                    water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are\n                    strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are\n                    weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when\n                    dissolved in water.</p>\n                <p>The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several\n                    factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces\n                    that may exist between the substances\xe2\x80\x99 atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to\n                    dissolve is quantified as a substance\xe2\x80\x99s solubility, its maximum concentration in a\n                    solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute\n                    at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a\n                    solute\xe2\x80\x99s concentration exceeds its solubility\xe2\x80\x94a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that\n                    will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.\n                    Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low\n                    mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing\n                    temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.\n                    The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial\n                    pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry\xe2\x80\x99s\n                    law.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n     \n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under  <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
