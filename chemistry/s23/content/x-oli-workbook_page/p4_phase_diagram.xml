Considering the definition of boiling point, plots of vapor\n            pressure versus temperature represent how the boiling point of the liquid varies with\n            pressure. Also described was the use of heating and cooling curves to determine a\n            substance\xe2\x80\x99s melting (or freezing) point. Making such measurements over a wide range of\n            pressures yields data that may be presented graphically as a phase diagram. A phase\n            diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the liquid-gas, solid-liquid,\n            and solid-gas phase-transition equilibria of a substance. These diagrams indicate the\n            physical states that exist under specific conditions of pressure and temperature, and\n            also provide the pressure dependence of the phase-transition temperatures (melting\n            points, sublimation points, boiling points). A typical phase diagram for a pure\n            substance is shown below.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_04_PhaseDi.jpg" alt="A graph is shown where the x-axis is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cTemperature\xe2\x80\x9d and the y-axis is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cPressure.\xe2\x80\x9d A line extends from the lower left bottom of the graph sharply upward to a point that is a third across the x-axis.

For example, a pressure of 50 kPa and\n            a temperature of \xe2\x88\x9210 \xc2\xb0C correspond to the region of the diagram labeled \xe2\x80\x9cice.\xe2\x80\x9d Under\n            these conditions, water exists only as a solid (ice). A pressure of 50 kPa and a\n            temperature of 50 \xc2\xb0C correspond to the \xe2\x80\x9cwater\xe2\x80\x9d region\xe2\x80\x94here, water exists only as a\n            liquid. At 25 kPa and 200 \xc2\xb0C, water exists only in the gaseous state. Note that on the\n                H<sub>2</sub>O phase diagram, the pressure and temperature axes are not drawn to a\n            constant scale in order to permit the illustration of several important features as\n            described here.</p>\n    <!--    <p>The curve BC is the \xe2\x80\x9cliquid-vapor\xe2\x80\x9d curve that separates the liquid and gaseous regions of\n            the phase diagram and provides the boiling point for water at any pressure. For example,\n            at 1 atm, the boiling point is 100 \xc2\xb0C. </p>\n        <p>The solid-vapor curve, labeled AB, indicates the temperatures and pressures at which ice\n            and water vapor are in equilibrium. These temperature-pressure data pairs correspond to\n            the sublimation, or deposition, points for water.  </p>\n      \n        <p>The solid-liquid curve labeled BD shows the temperatures and pressures at which ice and\n            liquid water are in equilibrium, representing the melting/freezing points for water.\n            Note that this curve exhibits a slight negative slope (greatly exaggerated for clarity),\n            indicating that the melting point for water decreases slightly as pressure increases.\n            Water is an unusual substance in this regard, as most substances exhibit an increase in\n            melting point with increasing pressure. </p>\n        \n        <p>The point of intersection of all three curves is labeled B. At the pressure and\n            temperature represented by this point, all three phases of water coexist in equilibrium.\n            This temperature-pressure data pair is called the triple point. At pressures lower than\n            the triple point, water cannot exist as a liquid, regardless of the temperature.</p>-->\n       \n        <wb:inline idref="phase_dia_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n       \n        <p>Consider the phase diagram for carbon dioxide shown below as another example. The\n            solid-liquid curve exhibits a positive slope, indicating that the melting point for CO<sub>2</sub>\n            increases with pressure as it does for most substances. Notice that the triple point is well above 1 atm, indicating\n            that carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid under ambient pressure conditions. Instead,\n            cooling gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm results in its deposition into the solid state.\n            Likewise, solid carbon dioxide does not melt at 1 atm pressure but instead sublimes to\n            yield gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, notice that the critical point for carbon dioxide is\n            observed at a relatively modest temperature and pressure in comparison to water.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_04_CO2PhasDi.jpg" alt="A graph is shown where the x-axis is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cTemperature ( degree sign, C )\xe2\x80\x9d and has values of negative 100 to 100 in increments of 25 and the y-axis is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cPressure ( k P a )\xe2\x80\x9d and has values of 10 to 1,000,000.

A distinct boundary between the\n                    more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the\n                    temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas\n                    curve in the phase diagram for water, and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and\n                    gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 \xc2\xb0C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218\n                    atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the\n                    boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now\n                    present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of\n                    the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and\n                    the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point\n                    . Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much\n                    pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature\n                    is called the critical pressure.
