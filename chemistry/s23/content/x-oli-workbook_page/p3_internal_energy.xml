Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms\n            or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased\n            translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or\n            molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the amplitudes of these motions decrease and the\n            kinetic energy falls. The total of all energy present in a substance, including both\n            kinetic and potential energy, is called the internal energy (<em style="italic">E</em>).\n            As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be\n            transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system.\n            A system is defined as the substance or substances undergoing chemical or physical\n            change of interest. The surroundings can be defined as everything else in the\n            universe.</p>\n\n        <section>\n            <title></title>\n            <body>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n               <dl>\n                   <dt><em>Change in Internal Energy Equation</em></dt>\n                   <dd>\n                       <p>The change in internal energy or \xe2\x88\x86<em style="italic">E</em> is\n                           defined by the equation below.\n                       </p>\n                       <formula>$$\\triangle E\\;=\\;E_\\mathrm{final}\\;-\\;E_\\mathrm{initial}$$</formula>\n                       <p>\xe2\x88\x86<em style="italic">E</em> is negative when the system releases energy to\n                           the surroundings. \xe2\x88\x86<em style="italic">E</em> is positive when\n                               the system gains energy from the surroundings.</p>\n                   </dd>\n               </dl>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n              \n                <p>Chemists use graphs to depict changes in internal energy.

Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when\n                    heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the\n                    surroundings.</p>\n       \n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>     \n                <dl>\n                   <dt><em>Internal Energy, Heat, and Work</em></dt>\n                   <dd>\n                       <p>The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be\n                           represented by the equation:</p>\n                       <formula>\n                           <m:math display="block">\n                               <m:mrow>\n                                   <m:mi>&Delta;</m:mi>\n                                   <m:mi>E</m:mi>\n                                   <m:mtext fontfamily="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</m:mtext>\n                                   <m:mo>=</m:mo>\n                                   <m:mtext fontfamily="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</m:mtext>\n                                   <m:mi>q</m:mi>\n                                   <m:mtext fontfamily="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</m:mtext>\n                                   <m:mo>+</m:mo>\n                                   <m:mtext fontfamily="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</m:mtext>\n                                   <m:mi>w</m:mi>\n                               </m:mrow>\n                           </m:math>\n                       </formula>\n                       <p>where <em style="italic">E</em> is internal energy, <em style="italic">q</em> is heat, and <em style="italic">w</em>\n                           is work.</p>\n                   </dd>\n               </dl>\n<image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>               \n               \n                <p>Chemists use the following sign conventions for q and w: </p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li><em style="italic">q</em> is positive when heat is transferred to the system\n                        (gains energy)</li>\n                    <li><em style="italic">q</em> is negative when heat is lost from the system\n                        (loses energy)</li>\n                    <li><em style="italic">w</em> is positive when work is done on the system (gains\n                        energy)</li>\n                    <li><em style="italic">w</em> is negative when the system does work (loses\n                        energy)</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <p>A strategy that you can use to remember this is to view the world from the\n                    system\'s perspective. </p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>If my (the system\'s) energy is increasing (I\'m getting more energy), then\n                        the sign is positive.</li>\n                    <li>If my (the system\'s) energy is decreasing (I\'m losing more energy), then the\n                        sign is negative.</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>The sign of \xe2\x88\x86<em style="italic">E</em> specifies whether the process is\n                    exothermic or endothermic.

Therefore, any decrease in\n                    internal energy of a system must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in\n                    internal energy of the surroundings, and vice versa. </p>\n\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <example>\n            <p>A system absorbs 55 kJ of heat from its surroundings, while doing 13 kJ of work on\n                the surroundings.

Internal energy is a type of quantity known as a state function (or\n                    state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a\n                    state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how\n                    that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value\n                    does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is\n                    altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at\n                    an altitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter whether you hiked there or\n                    parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however,\n                    is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a\n                    more roundabout, circuitous path. The distances traveled would differ (distance\n                    is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude\n                    is a state function).</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/mountain.jpg" alt="An aerial photo depicts a view of Mount Kilimanjaro.
