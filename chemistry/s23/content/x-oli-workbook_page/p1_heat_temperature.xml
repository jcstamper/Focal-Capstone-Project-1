Assuming\n            that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs,\n            increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature\n            to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as\n            condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of\n            matter will cause its temperature to decrease.</p>\n        <materials>\n            <material>\n                <image src="../webcontent/KE_water1.gif" width="200">\n                    <caption>The water molecules on the left are at a lower temperature, have less\n                        avg KE.

Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases\n            the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we\n            initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low\n            temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a\n            higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L,\n            the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The\n            temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the\n            temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules.\n            Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/heat_transfer.jpg" alt="Three drawings are shown and labeled a, b, and c, respectively.

A cold pack used to\n            treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process.
