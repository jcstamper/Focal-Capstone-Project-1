The system\'s response to these disturbances is described by Le Ch\xc3\xa2telier\'s\n            principle: The system will respond in a way that counteracts the disturbance. Not all\n            changes to the system result in a disturbance of the equilibrium. Adding a catalyst\n            affects the rates of the reactions but does not alter the equilibrium, and changing\n            pressure or volume will not significantly disturb systems with no gases or with equal\n            numbers of moles of gas on the reactant and product side.</p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
