The value of \xce\x94<em style="italic">H</em> for a reaction in one direction is\n                    equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to \xce\x94<em style="italic">H</em> for the reaction\n                    in the opposite direction, and \xce\x94<em style="italic">H</em> is directly proportional to\n                    the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation,\xce\x94<em\n                        style="italic">H</em><sup>\xe2\x88\x98</sup><sub>f</sub> is the enthalpy change accompanying\n                    the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at\n                    1 bar (standard state). If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise\n                    processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy\n                    changes of the various steps. A particularly useful form of Hess\xe2\x80\x99s laws is predicting\n                    the enthalpy of a reaction from the enthalpies of formation of the reactants and\n                    products. </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        \n        \n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Enthalpy</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
