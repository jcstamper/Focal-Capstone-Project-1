This attractive force is also called the London dispersion force in honor of\n            German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. Because the electrons of an atom or\n            molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron\xe2\x80\x99s location is subject\n            to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can\n            develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed\n            asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a\n            neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly\n            fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction\n            between the species\xe2\x80\x94a dispersion force like that illustrated below.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/dispersion_force.jpg" alt="Two pairs of molecules are shown where each molecule has one larger blue side labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdelta sign, negative sign\xe2\x80\x9d and a smaller red side labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdelta sign, positive sign.\xe2\x80\x9d Toward the middle of the both molecules, but still on each distinct side, is a black dot.

The forces are relatively weak, however, can become significant\n            only when the molecules are very close. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit\n            stronger dispersion forces than do smaller and lighter atoms and molecules.\n                F<sub>2</sub> and Cl<sub>2</sub> are gases at room temperature (reflecting weaker\n            attractive forces); Br<sub>2</sub> is a liquid, and I<sub>2</sub> is a solid (reflecting\n            stronger attractive forces). Trends in observed melting and boiling points for the\n            halogens clearly demonstrate this effect, as seen in the table below.</p>\n        <table rowstyle="alternating">\n            <tr>\n                <th>Halogen</th>\n                <th>Molar Mass</th>\n                <th>Atomic Radius</th>\n                <th>Melting Point</th>\n                <th>Boiling Point</th>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>fluorine, F<sub>2</sub></td>\n                <td>38 g/mol</td>\n                <td>72 pm</td>\n                <td>53 K</td>\n                <td>85 K</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub></td>\n                <td>71 g/mol</td>\n                <td>99 pm</td>\n                <td>172 K</td>\n                <td>238 K</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>bromine, Br<sub>2</sub></td>\n                <td>160 g/mol</td>\n                <td>114 pm</td>\n                <td>266 K</td>\n                <td>332 K</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>iodine, I<sub>2</sub></td>\n                <td>254 g/mol</td>\n                <td>133 pm</td>\n                <td>387 K</td>\n                <td>457 K</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>astatine, At<sub>2</sub></td>\n                <td>420 g/mol</td>\n                <td>150 pm</td>\n                <td>575 K</td>\n                <td>610 K</td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>The increase in melting and boiling points with increasing atomic/molecular size may be\n            rationalized by considering how the strength of dispersion forces is affected by the\n            electronic structure of the atoms or molecules in the substance. In a larger atom, the\n            valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei than in a smaller atom. Thus,\n            they are less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that produce\n            the attraction. The measure of how easy or difficult it is for another electrostatic\n            charge (for example, a nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecule\xe2\x80\x99s charge\n            distribution (its electron cloud) is known as polarizability. A molecule that has a\n            charge cloud that is easily distorted is said to be very polarizable and will have large\n            dispersion forces; one with a large cloud that is difficult to distort is not very\n            polarizable and will have small dispersion forces.</p>\n        <example>\n            <p>Order the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to\n                highest boiling point: CH<sub>4</sub>, SiH<sub>4</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>, and\n                    SnH<sub>4</sub>. Explain your reasoning.</p>\n            <p/>\n            <p>All of these compounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may\n                experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the molecule, the less polarizable\n                and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the\n                dispersion forces. The molar masses of CH<sub>4</sub>, SiH<sub>4</sub>,\n                    GeH<sub>4</sub>, and SnH<sub>4</sub> are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol, 77 g/mol, and\n                123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH<sub>4</sub> is expected to have the lowest\n                boiling point and SnH<sub>4</sub> the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to\n                highest boiling point is expected to be CH<sub>4</sub> &lt; SiH<sub>4</sub> &lt;\n                    GeH<sub>4</sub> &lt; SnH<sub>4</sub>.</p>\n            <p>A graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the\n                group 14 element shows this prediction to be correct:</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/graph_dispersion.jpg" alt="A line graph, titled \xe2\x80\x9cCarbon Family,\xe2\x80\x9d is shown where the y-axis is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cTemperature, ( degree sign C )\xe2\x80\x9d and has values of \xe2\x80\x9cnegative 200\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cnegative 40\xe2\x80\x9d from bottom to top in increments of 20.

For example, boiling points for the isomers n-pentane, isopentane,\n                    and neopentane (shown below) are 36 \xc2\xb0C, 27 \xc2\xb0C, and 9.5 \xc2\xb0C, respectively. Even\n                    though these compounds are composed of molecules with the same chemical formula,\n                        C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, the difference in boiling points suggests that\n                    dispersion forces in the liquid phase are different, being greatest for\n                    n-pentane and least for neopentane. The elongated shape of n-pentane provides a\n                    greater surface area available for contact between molecules, resulting in\n                    correspondingly stronger dispersion forces. The more compact shape of isopentane\n                    offers a smaller surface area available for intermolecular contact and,\n                    therefore, weaker dispersion forces. Neopentane molecules are the most compact\n                    of the three, offering the least available surface area for intermolecular\n                    contact and, hence, the weakest dispersion forces. This behavior is analogous to\n                    the connections that may be formed between strips of VELCRO brand fasteners: the\n                    greater the area of the strip\xe2\x80\x99s contact, the stronger the connection.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/dispersion_shapes.jpg" width="600"\n                    alt="Three images of molecules are shown.
