In all cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence\n            shell electrons between atoms. In this module, we will explore the typical method for\n            depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely <extra><anchor>Lewis symbols</anchor><meaning><material><p>symbol for an element or monatomic ion that uses a dot to represent each valence electron in the element or ion</p></material></meaning></extra> and <extra><anchor>Lewis structures</anchor><meaning><material><p>diagram showing lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons in a molecule or an ion</p></material></meaning></extra>.</p>\n        <p>We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic\n            ions.
