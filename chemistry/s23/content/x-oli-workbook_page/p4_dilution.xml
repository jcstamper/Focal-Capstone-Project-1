For example, we might say that a glass of iced tea becomes\n            increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the\n            volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby\n            reducing the relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its\n            taste.</p>\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/beakers.png"\n            alt="This figure shows two graduated cylinders side-by-side. The first has about half as much blue liquid as the second. The blue liquid is darker in the first cylinder than in the second."/>\n\n        <p>Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By\n            adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can\n            achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically\n            sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is\n            appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must\n            be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of\n            common laboratory reagents. </p>\n\n        <p>A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations\n            of a solution before and after the dilution process. According to the definition of\n            molarity, the molar amount of solute in a solution is equal to the product of the\n            solution\xe2\x80\x99s molarity and its volume in liters:</p>\n        <formula>$$n\\;=\\;\\mathrm{ML}$$</formula>\n\n        <p>Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:</p>\n        <formula>$$\\begin{array}{l}n_1\\;=\\;{\\mathrm M}_1{\\mathrm L}_1\\\\n_{2\\;}=\\;{\\mathrm\n            M}_2{\\mathrm L}_2\\end{array}$$</formula>\n\n        <p>where the subscripts \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c2\xe2\x80\x9d refer to the solution before and after the dilution,\n            respectively. Since the dilution process does not change the amount of solute in the\n            solution, <em style="italic">n</em><sub>1</sub> = <em style="italic">n</em><sub>2</sub>. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to\n            one another.</p>\n        <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n        <dl>\n            <dt><em>Dilution Equation</em></dt>\n            <dd>\n                <formula>$${\\mathrm M}_1{\\mathrm L}_1\\;=\\;{\\mathrm M}_2{\\mathrm L}_2$$</formula>\n                <p>Although we derived this equation using molarity as the unit of concentration and\n                    liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be\n                    used, so long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method.\n                    Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more\n                    general form:</p>\n                <formula>$$C_1V_1\\;=\\;C_2V_2$$</formula>\n                <p>where <em style="italic">C</em> and <em style="italic">V</em> are concentration\n                    and volume, respectively.</p>\n            </dd>\n        </dl>\n        <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n\n        <example>\n            <p>If 0.850 L of a 5.00\xe2\x88\x92M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is\n                diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the\n                diluted solution?</p>\n\n            <p>We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, <em style="italic">V</em><sub>1</sub> and\n                    <em style="italic">C</em><sub>1</sub>, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, <em style="italic">V</em><sub>2</sub>.\n                We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, <em style="italic">C</em><sub>2</sub>.
