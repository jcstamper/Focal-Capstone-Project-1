Why did electrons orbit at only\n\t\t\t\t\tfixed distances defined by a single quantum number <em style="italic">n</em> = 1, 2, 3, and so on, but\n\t\t\t\t\tnever in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen and\n\t\t\t\t\tone-electron ions, but could not correctly predict the emission spectrum for\n\t\t\t\t\thelium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed to\n\t\t\t\t\tcompletely revise the way they thought about matter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>We know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world\xe2\x80\x94objects that are large enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard\n\t\t\t\t\tball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is\n\t\t\t\t\tacted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined\n\t\t\t\t\tposition and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, <em style="italic">p</em> = <em style="italic">mv</em>) at any given moment.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the\n\t\t\t\t\ttypical behavior of a classical object.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>When waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example,\n\t\t\t\t\tinteracting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patters\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar to those shown in the image below. This is a case of wave behavior on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent phenomena in the macroscopic realm.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<image src="../webcontent/water_surface.jpeg" width="600"\n\t\t\t\t\talt="A photograph is shown of ripples in water.

The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase for the microscopic world.</p>\n\t\t\t</body>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t<section>\n\t\t\t<title>Electrons and Wave-like Characteristics</title>\n\t\t\t<body>\n\t\t\t\t<p>One of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmicroscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If\n\t\t\t\t\telectromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and\n\t\t\t\t\tother submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral\n\t\t\t\t\tdissertation, de Broglie extended the wave\xe2\x80\x93particle duality of light that\n\t\t\t\t\tEinstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linear\n\t\t\t\t\tmomentum p) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value\n\t\t\t\t\t\xce\xbb, given by this expression in which h is the familiar Planck\xe2\x80\x99s constant:</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p><formula>$$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}$$</formula></p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of \xce\xbb discussed\n\t\t\t\t\tearlier, the de Broglie wavelength is a characteristic of particles and other\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this equation involves velocity\n\t\t\t\t\t[v, m/s], not frequency [\xce\xbd, Hz]). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Bohr\xe2\x80\x99s assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that\n\t\t\t\t\tonly an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<image src="../webcontent/elec_orbit.jpeg" width="600"\n\t\t\t\t\talt="This figure includes a circle formed from a dashed line.

This means that electron wavelike behavior\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis going to be noticeable in an atom.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</example>\n\t\t\t\t<wb:inline idref="softball_wave_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Shortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at\n\t\t\t\t\tBell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally\n\t\t\t\t\tthat electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern\n\t\t\t\t\tfor electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The\n\t\t\t\t\tregularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference\n\t\t\t\t\texperiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern\n\t\t\t\t\tto form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \xe2\x80\x9cslits,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. In the image below,\n\t\t\t\t\tpart a shows an interference pattern. The wave\xe2\x80\x93particle duality of matter can be\n\t\t\t\t\tseen in diagrams below by observing what happens if electron collisions are\n\t\t\t\t\trecorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small\n\t\t\t\t\tlocalized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived\n\t\t\t\t\tand were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike\n\t\t\t\t\tbehavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized\n\t\t\t\t\tparticles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by\n\t\t\t\t\tclassical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation\n\t\t\t\t\tthat governs a probability distribution even for a single electron\xe2\x80\x99s motion.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus the wave\xe2\x80\x93particle duality first observed with photons is actually a\n\t\t\t\t\tfundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<image src="../webcontent/electrons.jpeg" width="600"\n\t\t\t\t\talt="This figure has two parts. Part a shows a diagram of an electron source emitting waves that pass through two narrow slits in a barrier. A wave interference pattern results on the opposite side of the barrier that result in evenly spaced, relatively wide horizontal grey lines on a black surface. The black surface is placed at a distance beyond the barrier. Part b shows an electron source at the far left. Two gold arrows point toward two narrow horizontal slits in a barrier. Around these arrows are many small golden dots. On the right side of the barrier, the gold dots are more widely dispersed. A black surface a distance beyond the barrier shows evenly, yet widely dispersed gold dots. An arrow is present below this black surface and is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cTime.\xe2\x80\x9d A second black surface is shown to the right that has many more golden dots that appear to be organizing into a pattern of evenly spaced horizontal line segments. A third black surface is shown even further to the right in which many more gold dots are shown in a very clearly established, evenly spaced pattern of horizontal line segments.">\n\t\t\t\t\t<caption>(a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can\n\t\t\t\t\t\texhibit wavelike behavior. (b) The experimental results illustrated here\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdemonstrate the wave\xe2\x80\x93particle duality in electrons. The electrons pass\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrough very closely spaced slits, forming an interference pattern, with\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing numbers of electrons being recorded from the left image to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tright. With only a few electrons recorded, it is clear that the electrons\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarrive as individual localized \xe2\x80\x9cparticles,\xe2\x80\x9d but in a seemingly random\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpattern. As more electrons arrive, a wavelike interference pattern begins to\n\t\t\t\t\t\temerge. Note that the probability of the final electron location is still\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoverned by the wave-type distribution, even for a single electron, but it\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcan be observed more easily if many electron collisions have been recorded.\n\t\t\t\t\t</caption>\n\t\t\t\t</image>\n\t\t\t\t<wb:inline idref="debroglie_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n\t\t\t</body>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t<p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n\t\t\t>Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n\t\t\t\thref="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\n\t\t\t\tLicense</link>. </p>\n\t\t<p>Download for free at <link\n\t\t\thref="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n\t\t\t>http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312</link>.</p>\n\t</body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
