We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP,\n            which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in the following\n            figure. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second\n            layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact\n            with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP,\n            atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is\n            also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers\n            (i.e., ABABAB\xe2\x8b\xaf). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two\n            layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type\n            B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABC\xe2\x8b\xaf).
