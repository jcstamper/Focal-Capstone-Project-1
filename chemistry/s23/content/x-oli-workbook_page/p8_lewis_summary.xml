Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are\n                    used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a\n                    Lewis structure. Most structures\xe2\x80\x94especially those containing second row\n                    elements\xe2\x80\x94obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by\n                    eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules\n                    (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.</p>\n\n                <p>In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating\n                    each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These\n                    hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate\n                    Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as\n                    possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis\n                    structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of\n                    electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance\n                    hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis\n                    structures (the resonance forms).</p>\n                <p>The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that\n                    is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of\n                    molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms.\n                    The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required\n                    to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Ionic and Covalent Bonding</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can\n                    be for clarification of the material or further insight.
