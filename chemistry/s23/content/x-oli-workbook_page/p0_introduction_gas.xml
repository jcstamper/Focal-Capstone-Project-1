Heated gases expand, which can make a hot\n            air balloon rise or cause a blowout in a bicycle tire left in the sun on a hot day.</p>\n        <p>Gases have played an important part in the development of chemistry. In the seventeenth\n            and eighteenth centuries, many scientists investigated gas behavior, providing the first\n            mathematical descriptions of the behavior of matter.</p>\n        <p>In this unit, we will examine the relationships between gas temperature, pressure,\n            amount, and volume. We will study a simple theoretical model and use it to analyze the\n            experimental behavior of gases. The results of these analyses will show us the\n            limitations of the theory and how to improve on it.</p>\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
