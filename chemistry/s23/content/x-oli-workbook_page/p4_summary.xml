The basic building \n                    block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter \n                    into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances, \n                    atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three \n                    states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but \n                    fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature \n                    conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is \n                    composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts \n                    and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in composition \n                    from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to \n                    point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be \n                    an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by \n                    a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms.</p>\n                <p>\n                    \n                    All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo \n                    physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, \n                    and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the \n                    composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and \n                    chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from \n                    that present beforehand.</p>\n               \n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Properties of Matter</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
