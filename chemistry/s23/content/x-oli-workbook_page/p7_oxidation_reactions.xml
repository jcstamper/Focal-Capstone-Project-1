While the vast majority of redox\n            reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, a few\n            interesting exceptions to this rule do exist. Definitions for the complementary\n            processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:</p>\n        \n        <formula><em style="bold">oxidation = increase in oxidation number</em></formula>\n        \n        <formula> <em style="bold">reduction = decrease in oxidation number</em></formula>\n        \n        <p> Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified\n            as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium\n            chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in\n            NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in\n            Cl<sub>2</sub> to \xe2\x88\x921 in NaCl). </p>\n        \n        <image src="../webcontent/oxi.png"\n            alt="In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to \xe2\x88\x921 in NaCl)."/>\n        \n        <p>In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its\n            oxidation number increases from 0 in H<sub>2</sub> to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced\n            (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl<sub>2</sub> to \xe2\x88\x921 in HCl).</p>\n        \n        <image src="../webcontent/Cl2.png"\n            alt="In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in H2 to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to \xe2\x88\x921 in HCl)."/>\n        \n        <p>Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including single-displacement\n            (replacement) reactions. These are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is\n            displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of\n            this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals:</p>\n        \n        <image src="../webcontent/znPlusHcl.PNG"\n            alt="In the reaction between elemental zinc and hydrochloric acid, zinc is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Zn to +2 in ZnCl2) and hydrogen is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from +1 in HCl to 0 in H2)."/>\n        \n        <p>Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for\n            example:</p>\n        \n        <image src="../webcontent/cuPlusAgNO3.PNG"\n            alt="In the reaction between elemental copper and silver nitrate, copper is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Cu to +2 in Cu(NO3)2) and silver is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from +1 in AgNO3 to 0 in Ag).">\n            \n            <caption>In this reaction between Cu and AgNO3 that yields Cu(NO3)2 and Ag, the copper\n                is oxidized because its oxidation number increases from 0 to +2 and the silver is\n                reduced because its oxidation number decreases from +1 to 0. The nitrate ion is\n                neither oxidized nor reduced because its oxidation number remains the\n                same.</caption>\n        </image>\n        \n        <p>This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved\n            silver salt. Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of\n            the copper wire, and the resulting Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions dissolve in the solution to\n            yield a characteristic blue color.</p>\n        \n        <image src="../webcontent/copper.png"\n            alt="This figure contains three photographs. In a, a coiled copper wire is shown beside a test tube filled with a clear, colorless liquid. In b, the wire has been inserted into the test tube with the clear, colorless liquid. In c, the test tube contains a light blue liquid and the coiled wire appears to have a fuzzy silver gray coating.">\n            \n            <caption>(a) A copper wire is shown next to a solution containing silver(I) ions. (b)\n                Displacement of dissolved silver ions by copper ions results in (c) accumulation of\n                gray-colored silver metal on the wire and development of a blue color in the\n                solution, due to dissolved copper ions.
