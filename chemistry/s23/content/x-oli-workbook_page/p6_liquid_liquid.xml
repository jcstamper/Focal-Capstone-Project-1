Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and\n            ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze) are examples of liquids that are\n            completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline.</p>\n        <p>Liquids that mix with water in all proportions are usually polar substances or substances\n            that form hydrogen bonds. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen\n            bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as\n            those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds\n            of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because\n            there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent,\n            and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in\n            polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration\n            of the chemical axiom \xe2\x80\x9clike dissolves like.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n        <materials>\n            <material>\n                <p>Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible.\n                    Layers are formed when we pour immiscible liquids into the same container.\n                    Gasoline, oil, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other\n                    nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. The attraction between the molecules\n                    of such nonpolar liquids and polar water molecules is ineffectively weak. The\n                    only strong attractions in such a mixture are between the water molecules, so\n                    they effectively squeeze out the molecules of the nonpolar liquid. The\n                    distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of degrees, so\n                    that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to\n                    be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility.</p>\n            </material>\n            <material>\n                <image src="../webcontent/Water_and_oil.jpg" width="350">\n                    <caption>Oil and water do not mix.

Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when\n            mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated\n            with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is\n            nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly\n            discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water\n            in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine\n            layer.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_03_bromine.jpg" alt="This figure shows three test tubes. The first test tube holds a dark orange-brown substance. The second test tube holds a clear substance. The amount of substance in both test tubes is the same. The third test tube holds a dark orange-brown substance on the bottom with a lighter orange substance on top. The amount of substance in the third test tube is almost double of the first two." width="450">\n            <caption>Bromine (the deep orange liquid on the left) and water (the colorless liquid in the\n                middle) are partially miscible. The top layer in the mixture on the right is a\n                saturated solution of bromine in water; the bottom layer is a saturated solution of\n                water in bromine.
