In a liquid, intermolecular attractive forces\n            hold the molecules in contact, although they still have sufficient KE to move past each\n            other.</p>\n        <p>Intermolecular attractive forces, collectively referred to as van der Waals forces, are\n            responsible for the behavior of liquids and solids and are electrostatic in nature.\n            Dipole-dipole attractions result from the electrostatic attraction of the partial\n            negative end of one dipolar molecule for the partial positive end of another. The\n            temporary dipole that results from the motion of the electrons in an atom can induce a\n            dipole in an adjacent atom and give rise to the London dispersion force. London forces\n            increase with increasing molecular size. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of\n            dipole-dipole attraction that results when hydrogen is bonded to one of the three most\n            electronegative elements: F, O, or N.</p>\n        <p>The intermolecular forces between molecules in the liquid state vary depending upon their\n            chemical identities and result in corresponding variations in various physical\n            properties. Cohesive forces between like molecules are responsible for a liquid\xe2\x80\x99s\n            viscosity (resistance to flow) and surface tension (elasticity of a liquid surface).\n            Adhesive forces between the molecules of a liquid and different molecules composing a\n            surface in contact with the liquid are responsible for phenomena such as surface wetting\n            and capillary rise.</p>\n    </body>\n</section>\n      \n        \n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Intermolecular Forces</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
