For\n            instance, if a measurement is given in miles it may be convenient or necessary to\n            convert it to km or m. <extra><anchor>Dimensional analysis</anchor><meaning><material><p>Method used to convert from one unit of measure to another.</p></material></meaning></extra> (or factor-label method) is a method used to\n            convert from one unit of measure to another. Dimensional analysis is based on this\n            premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations\n            as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from\n            simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several\n            different quantities.</p>\n        <p>A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be\n            used as a <extra><anchor>unit conversion factor</anchor><meaning><material><p>ratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit</p></material></meaning></extra>. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are\n            equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the\n            ratio,</p>\n        <formula>$$\\;\\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.}\\;(2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}\\;=\\;1\\;\\mathrm{in}.)\\;\\mathrm{or}\\;2.54\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{in}.}$$</formula>\n        <p>Several other commonly used equalities are given in table below.</p>\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <td align="center"><em style="bold">Length</em></td>\n                <td align="center"><em style="bold">Volume</em></td>\n                <td align="center"><em style="bold">Mass</em></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>1 m = 1.0936 yd</td>\n                <td>1 L = 1.0567 qt</td>\n                <td>1 kg = 2.2046 lb</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>1 in. = 2.54 cm (exact)</td>\n                <td>1 qt = 0.94635 L</td>\n                <td>1 lb = 453.59 g</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>1 km = 0.62137 mi</td>\n                <td>1 gal = 3.7854 L</td>\n                <td>1 oz = 28.349 g</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>1 mi = 1609.3 m</td>\n                <td>1 fl oz = 29.5735 mL</td>\n                <td/>\n            </tr>\n\n        </table>\n        <p>*Note in the table above, that the English units ounces (oz) and fluid ounces (fl oz) are\n            often both referred to as ounces in everyday use. However, they are distinctly different\n            as oz is a unit of mass and fl oz is a unit of volume.</p>\n        <p>When we multiply a quantity (such as distance given in inches) by an appropriate unit\n            conversion factor, we convert the quantity to an equivalent value with different units\n            (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball player\xe2\x80\x99s vertical jump of\n            34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:</p>\n        <formula>$$34\\;\\mathrm{in}.\\;\\times\\;\\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.}\\;=\\;86\\;\\mathrm{cm}$$</formula>\n        <p>When we multiply by the unit factor\n                <formula>$$\\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.}$$</formula> we do not change\n            the value of the measurement because 2.54 cm is equivalent to 1 in. </p></body></section>\n        <example id="p6_dim_analysis_single_ex1">\n            <p>The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit\n                conversion factor derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g.</p>\n            <p>We can form two conversion factors from the relationship between ounces and\n                grams.</p>\n            <formula>$$\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{oz}}{28.349\\;\\mathrm g}\\;\\mathrm{and}\\;\\frac{28.349\\;\\mathrm\n                g}{1\\;\\mathrm{oz}}$$</formula>\n            <p>To determine which conversion factor to use to make the conversion, we need to look\n                carefully at the units. Since we are converting from g to oz, we want the unit of g\n                to cancel out. The unit factor that causes the unit of g to cancel is:</p>\n            <formula>$$\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{oz}}{28.349\\;\\mathrm g}$$</formula>\n            <formula>$$\\require{cancel}125\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm\n                g}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{oz}}{28.349\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm\n                g}}\\;\\;=\\;4.41\\;\\mathrm{oz}$$</formula>\n            <p>Notice that the unit of g cancels, leaving the unit of ounces. Also, notice that the\n                final answer has 3 significant figures because the original measurement has 3\n                significant figures. In this context, the 1 in 1 oz is an exact number and has an\n                infinite number of significant figures.</p>\n        </example>\n        <wb:inline idref="unit_conversion_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n        <wb:inline idref="unit_conversion_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
