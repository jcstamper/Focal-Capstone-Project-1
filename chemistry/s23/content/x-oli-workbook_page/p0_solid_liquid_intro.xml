As described in the final module on gases, this situation\n            changes at high pressures and low temperatures\xe2\x80\x94conditions that permit the atoms and\n            molecules to interact to a much greater extent. In the liquid and solid states, these\n            interactions are of considerable strength and play an important role in determining a\n            number of physical properties that do depend on the chemical identity of the substance.\n            In this unit, the nature of these interactions and their effects on various physical\n            properties of liquid and solid phases will be examined.</p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
