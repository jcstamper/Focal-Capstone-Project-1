The term <extra><anchor>oxidation</anchor><meaning><material><p>process in which an element\xe2\x80\x99s oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons\n            </p></material></meaning></extra> was originally\n            used to describe chemical reactions involving O<sub>2</sub>, but its meaning has evolved\n            to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox)\n            reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of\n            this classification.</p>\n\n        <p>Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield\n            ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium\n            chloride:</p>\n        <formula>$$2\\;\\mathrm{Na}(s)\\;+\\;{\\mathrm{Cl}}_2(g)\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;2\\;\\mathrm{NaCl}(s)$$</formula>\n\n\n\n        <p>It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to\n            represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a\n            half-reaction:</p>\n        <formula>$$2\\;\\mathrm{Na}(s)\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;2\\;\\mathrm{Na}^+(s)\\;+\\;2\\;\\mathrm\n            e^-$$</formula>\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm{Cl}}_2(g)\\;+\\;2\\;\\mathrm\n            e^-\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;2\\;\\mathrm{Cl}^-(s)$$</formula>\n\n\n        <p>These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl<sub>2</sub>\n            molecule) gain electrons, the \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x9d subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are\n            present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the\n            loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:</p>\n\n        <formula><em>oxidation</em> = loss of electrons</formula>\n\n        <formula><em>reduction</em> = gain of electrons </formula>\n        <p>In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes <extra><anchor>reduction</anchor><meaning><material><p>process in which an element\xe2\x80\x99s oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons\n        </p></material></meaning></extra>. Viewed from\n            a more active perspective, sodium functions as a <extra><anchor>reducing agent</anchor><meaning><material><p>(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized</p></material></meaning></extra> (reductant), since it\n            provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an\n            <extra><anchor>oxidizing agent</anchor><meaning><material><p>(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced</p></material></meaning></extra> (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes)\n            sodium.</p>\n\n        <formula><em>reducing agent</em> = species that is oxidized</formula>\n\n        <formula><em>oxidizing agent</em> = species that is reduced </formula>\n        <p>Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for\n            example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:</p>\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm\n            H}_2(g)\\;+\\;{\\mathrm{Cl}}_2(g)\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;2\\;\\mathrm{HCl}(g)$$</formula>\n\n\n\n        <p>The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the\n            explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the\n            previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called\n            oxidation number has been defined. The <extra><anchor>oxidation number</anchor><meaning><material><p>the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic</p></material></meaning></extra> (or <extra><anchor>oxidation state</anchor><meaning><material><p>the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic</p></material></meaning></extra>) of an\n            element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic.\n            The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a\n            molecule or ion.</p>\n        <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n        <dl>\n            <dt><em>Determining Oxidation Numbers</em></dt>\n            <dd>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero.</li>\n                    <li>The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion\xe2\x80\x99s charge.</li>\n                    <li>Oxidation numbers for common nonmetals are usually assigned as follows: <ul>\n                            <li>Hydrogen: +1 when combined with nonmetals, \xe2\x88\x921 when combined with\n                                metals</li>\n                            <li> Oxygen: \xe2\x88\x922 in most compounds, sometimes \xe2\x88\x921 (so-called peroxides,\n                                    O<sub>2</sub><sup>2\xe2\x88\x92</sup>), very rarely \xe2\x88\x921/2 (so-called\n                                superoxides, O<sub>2</sub><sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup>) positive values when combined with F\n                                (values vary)</li>\n                            <li> Halogens: \xe2\x88\x921 for F always, \xe2\x88\x921 for other halogens except when\n                                combined with oxygen or other halogens (positive oxidation numbers\n                                in these cases, varying values) </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </dd>\n            <dd>\n                <p>The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals\n                    the charge on the molecule or ion.</p></dd>\n            <dd>\n                <p>Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first,\n                    followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the\n                    reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2).
