The nucleus contains the majority of an atom\xe2\x80\x99s mass\n            because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy\n            almost all of an atom\xe2\x80\x99s volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of\n                10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9210</sup> m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10<sup>-15</sup>\n            m\xe2\x80\x94about 100,000 times smaller.</p>\n        <p>For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size\n            of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/blueberry.jpg" width="300" alt="blueberries"> </image>\n        <image src="../webcontent/football_stadium.jpg" width="600" alt="football stadium">\n            <caption>If an atom could be expanded to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus\n                would be the size of a single blueberry.

For\n            example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2 \xc3\x97 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9223</sup> g. When describing the\n            properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure.\n            The atomic mass unit (amu) is the unit of mass that is used for masses of atoms,\n            molecules, and subatomic particles. The amu is defined with regard to the most abundant\n            isotope of carbon, carbon\xe2\x88\x9212. An atom of carbon\xe2\x88\x9212 contains 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6\n            electrons. (Isotopes will be discussed in more detail in the next module). The mass of a\n            carbon\xe2\x88\x9212 atom is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. Thus, one amu is exactly 1/12 of the\n            mass of one carbon\xe2\x88\x9212 atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 x 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9224</sup> g.</p>\n        <p>The charge of subatomic particles is also extremely small. Like the amu, an appropriately\n            small unit of charge has been developed to describe the charge of subatomic particles.\n            An electron has a charge of less than 2 \xc3\x9710<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> C (coulomb). The fundamental\n            unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of\n            an electron (e) with e = 1.602 x 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> C. </p>\n        <p>A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier\n            particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is\n            neutral. The electron has a charge of 1\xe2\x88\x92 and is a much lighter particle with a mass of\n            about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton).\n            The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in table below.</p>\n        <wb:inline idref="atom_parts_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        <p>The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number (Z). This is the\n            defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For\n            example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic\n            number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must\n            contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons\n            equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number\n            of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called\n            its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass\n            number and the atomic number: A \xe2\x80\x93 Z = number of neutrons.</p>\n        <pullout>\n            <title/>\n            <p><formula>$$\\mathrm{atomic}\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;(\\mathrm\n                    Z)\\;=\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{protons}$$</formula>\n                <formula>$$\\mathrm{mass}\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;(\\mathrm\n                    A)\\;=\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{protons}\\;+\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{neutrons}$$</formula>\n                <formula>$$\\mathrm A\\;-\\;\\mathrm\n                    Z\\;=\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{neutrons}$$</formula>\n            </p>\n        </pullout>\n        <p>Atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged\n            protons and negatively charged electrons. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/atom_nucleus.png" width="600"\n            alt="Diagram of a simple atom.
