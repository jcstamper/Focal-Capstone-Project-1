The activities are\n                    designed to more fully engage you in the learning process. You will notice there\n                    are two categories of activities within the modules: <em style="italic">Learn By\n                        Doing</em> and <em style="italic">Did I Get This</em>.

One of the more obvious methods of guidance is hints. You will\n                            notice that many of these activities have hints. If you are unsure how\n                            to approach a problem, ask for a hint to guide you. Note that some\n                            problems have multiple hints.</p>\n                        <pullout>\n                            <p>Learn By Doing activities scaffold practice.
