Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be made to\n                    permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Dalton\xe2\x80\x99s law of\n                    partial pressures may be used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous\n                    mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro\xe2\x80\x99s law may be used in stoichiometric\n                    computations for chemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or products.\n                </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the learning\n                    objectives for the <em style="italic">Stoichiometry of Gases</em> module\n                    and use the <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any\n                    questions you might have about the material that you would like the instructor\n                    to address.
