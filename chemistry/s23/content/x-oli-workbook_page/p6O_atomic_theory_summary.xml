Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of\n                    atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms\n                    of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form\n                    compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental\n                    proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of\n                    one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small,\n                    whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor\n                    destroyed.</p>\n                <p>Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have\n                    demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson\xe2\x80\x99s cathode ray tube showed that\n                    atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan\n                    discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge\xe2\x80\x94the charge of an\n                    electron. Rutherford\xe2\x80\x99s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small,\n                    dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the\n                    nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains\n                    neutral particles called neutrons. </p>\n                <p>An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.\n                    The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times\n                    smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in\n                    atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is\n                    defined as exactly 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 x\n                    10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9224</sup> g.</p>\n                <p>Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073\n                    amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087\n                    amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1\xe2\x88\x92 and a mass of 0.00055\n                    amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is\n                    the property that defines an atom\xe2\x80\x99s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers\n                    of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed\n                    in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when\n                    it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n      \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
