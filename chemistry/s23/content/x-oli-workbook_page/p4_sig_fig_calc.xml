We must take the uncertainty in our\n            measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated\n            results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct\n            number of significant figures, which is determined by the following four rules for\n            rounding numbers:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same number of\n                decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal places (the least\n                uncertain value in terms of addition and subtraction).</li>\n            <li>When we multiply or divide numbers, we should round the result to the same number of\n                digits as the number with the least number of significant figures (the least uncertain\n                value in terms of multiplication and division).</li>\n            <li>If the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be\n                retained) is less than 5, we \xe2\x80\x9cround down\xe2\x80\x9d and leave the retained digit unchanged; if\n                it is more than 5, we \xe2\x80\x9cround up\xe2\x80\x9d and increase the retained digit by 1; If the\n                dropped digit is 5, and it\xe2\x80\x99s either the last digit in the number or it\xe2\x80\x99s followed\n                only by zeros, round up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained\n                digit. If any nonzero digits follow the dropped 5, round up. (The last part of this\n                rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it\xe2\x80\x99s based on reliable statistics and is aimed\n                at avoiding any bias when dropping the digit \xe2\x80\x9c5,\xe2\x80\x9d since it is equally close to both\n                possible values of the retained digit.)\n                <ul>\n                <li>0.028675 rounds \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7, is greater than 5)</li>\n                    <li>18.3384 rounds \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3, is less than 5)</li>\n                    <li>6.8652 rounds \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d to 6.87 (the dropped digit is 5, and a nonzero digit follows it)</li>\n                    <li>92.85 rounds \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)</li>\n                </ul>\n            </li>\n            \n            <li>Exact numbers have an infinite number of significant figures. </li>\n        </ul>\n        <wb:inline idref="round_sig_fig_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n        <wb:inline idref="round_sig_fig_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n        <section>\n            <title/>\n            <body>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"/>\n                <dl>\n                    <dt>Addition and Subtraction with Significant Figures</dt>\n                    <dd>\n                        <p>When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same\n                            number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal\n                            places (i.e., the least certain value in terms of addition and\n                            subtraction).</p>\n                    </dd>\n                </dl>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"/>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n\n\n\n\n\n        <example>\n            <p>Add 1.0023 g and 4.383 g.</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/add_sig_fig_example.png" width="400"\n                alt="Addition problem showing 1.0023 being added to 4.383 to yield the answer 5.385. 1.0023 goes to the ten thousandths place, but 4.383 goes to the thousandths place, making it the less precise of the two numbers.
