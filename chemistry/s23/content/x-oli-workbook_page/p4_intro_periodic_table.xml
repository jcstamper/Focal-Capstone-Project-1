One such\n            grouping includes:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>lithium (Li)</li>\n            <li>sodium (Na)</li>\n            <li>potassium (K)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar\n            chemical properties.</p>\n        <p> A second grouping includes: </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>calcium (Ca)</li>\n            <li>strontium (Sr)</li>\n            <li>barium (Ba)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p> which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical\n            properties in common. </p>\n        <p>However, the specific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each\n            other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li,\n            Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen\n            atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen\n            atom.</p>\n        <p>Other elements that exhibit similar properties to each other are:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>fluorine (F)</li>\n            <li>chlorine (Cl)</li>\n            <li>bromine (Br)</li>\n            <li>iodine (I)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>but the properties of this group of elements are drastically different from those of any\n            of the groups of elements above.</p>\n        <p>Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently\n            recognized that there was a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements\n            known at that time. Both published tables with the elements arranged according to\n            increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his\n            table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to\n            aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and\n            germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleev\xe2\x80\x99s work. Although Mendeleev and\n            Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleev\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to the development of\n            the periodic table are now more widely recognized.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/first_periodic_table.png" width="600"\n            alt="The first periodic table developed by Mendeleev, which had eight groups and twelve periods.

The modern statement of this relationship, the\n            periodic law, is as follows: the properties of the elements are periodic functions of\n            their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the elements in increasing order\n            of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical\n            column. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called periods or series,\n            and 18 vertical columns, called groups. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In\n            the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However,\n            IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more\n            common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14\n            columns, are usually written below the main body of the table.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/new_periodic_table.jpg" width="750" alt="The Periodic Table of Elements is shown.

For your\n                    convenience a link to the periodic table will be at the beginning of every\n                    module, starting with the next one. The periodic table from this link will open\n                    in a separate tab. It may be a good idea to open it at the beginning of the\n                    module, as you will likely need it throughout any given module. All calculations\n                    within this course that use atomic masses as they appear on this periodic table, most of which are rounded\n                    to the hundredths place. There are many sources of periodic tables online or you\n                    may want to have a paper copy with which to work. Use whatever works best for\n                    you.</p>\n               <image src="../webcontent/periodic_table2.jpg" width="800"></image>\n                <wb:inline idref="periodic_table_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <p>Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some\n            elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are\n            malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires),\n            and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or\n            ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into\n            large classes with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good\n            conductors of heat and electricity\xe2\x80\x94shaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull,\n            poor conductors of heat and electricity\xe2\x80\x94shaded green); and metalloids (elements that\n            conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and\n            some properties of nonmetals\xe2\x80\x94shaded purple).</p>\n        <p>The elements can also be classified into the main-group elements (or representative\n            elements) in the columns labeled 1, 2, and 13\xe2\x80\x9318; the transition metals in the columns\n            labeled 3\xe2\x80\x9312; and inner transition metals in the two rows at the bottom of the table\n            (the top-row elements are called lanthanides and the bottom-row elements are actinides.\n            The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the\n            composition of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first\n            column) form compounds that consist of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen.\n            These elements (except hydrogen) are known as alkali metals, and they all have similar\n            chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds\n            consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called\n            alkaline earth metals, with similar properties among members of that group. Other groups\n            with specific names are the pnictogens (group 15), chalcogens (group 16), halogens\n            (group 17), and the noble gases (group 18, also known as inert gases). The groups can\n            also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can\n            be called the oxygen group or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element\n            with properties similar to both group 1 and group 17 elements. For that reason, hydrogen\n            may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/periodic_table_groups.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="This diagram combines the groups and periods of the periodic table based on their similar properties. Group 1 contains the alkali metals, group 2 contains the earth alkaline metals, group 15 contains the pnictogens, group 16 contains the chalcogens, group 17 contains the halogens and group 18 contains the noble gases. The main group elements consist of groups 1, 2, and 12 through 18. Therefore, most of the transition metals, which are contained in groups 3 through 11, are not main group elements. The lanthanides and actinides are called out at the bottom of the periodic table.">\n            <caption>The periodic table organizes elements with similar properties into groups.\n            </caption>\n        </image>\n        <wb:inline idref="periodic_table_groups_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n        <wb:inline idref="intro_pt_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        <wb:inline idref="periodic_table_groups_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n                >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n                href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n                >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
