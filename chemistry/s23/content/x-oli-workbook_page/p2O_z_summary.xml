The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids,\n                covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of\n                crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the\n                arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them.\n                Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have\n                distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of\n                interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. </p></body>\n        </section>\n      \n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry </link>under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
