We start with a single\n\t\t\thydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. We would\n\t\t\texpect to find the electron in the 1s orbital. By convention, the m<sub>s</sub> = +1/2\n\t\t\tvalue is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram\n\t\t\tare:</p>\n\t\t<image src="../webcontent/orbdiag1.jpeg" width="300" alt="In this figure, the element symbol H is followed by the electron configuration is 1 s superscript 1. An orbital diagram is provided that consists of a single square. The square is labeled below as, \xe2\x80\x9c1 s.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains a single upward pointing half arrow."> </image>\n\t\t<p>Following hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2. The helium\n\t\t\tatom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four\n\t\t\tquantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (n = 1, l = 0, m<sub>l</sub> = 0,\n\t\t\t\tm<sub>s</sub> = +1/2). The second electron also goes into the 1s orbital and fills\n\t\t\tthat orbital. The second electron has the same n, l, and m<sub>l</sub> quantum numbers,\n\t\t\tbut must have the opposite spin quantum number, m<sub>s </sub>= \xe2\x88\x921/2. This is in accord\n\t\t\twith the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same\n\t\t\tset of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box\n\t\t\t(representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite\n\t\t\tdirections (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram\n\t\t\tof helium are:</p>\n\t\t<image src="../webcontent/orbdiag2.jpeg" width="300" alt="In this figure, the element symbol H e is followed by the electron configuration, \xe2\x80\x9c1 s superscript 2.\xe2\x80\x9d An orbital diagram is provided that consists of a single square.

There are three 2p orbitals of equal energy (ml= \xe2\x88\x921,\n\t\t\t0, +1) and the electron can occupy any one of these p orbitals.
