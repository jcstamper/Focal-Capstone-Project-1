The equation reads C H subscript 4 plus 2 O subscript 2 arrow C O subscript 2 plus 2 H subscript 2 O. Under the C H subscript 4, the molecule is shown with a central black sphere, representing a C atom, to which 4 smaller white spheres, representing H atoms, are distributed evenly around. All four H atoms are bonded to the central black C atom. This is followed by a plus sign. Under the 2 O subscript 2, two molecules are shown. The molecules are each composed of two red spheres bonded together. The red spheres represent O atoms. To the right of an arrow and under the C O subscript 2, appears a single molecule with a black central sphere with two red spheres bonded to the left and right. Following a plus sign and under the 2 H subscript 2 O, are two molecules, each with a central red sphere and two smaller white spheres attached to the lower right and lower left sides of the central red sphere. Note that in space filling models of molecules, spheres appear slightly compressed in regions where there is a bond between two atoms."/>\n\n        <p>This is a requirement the equation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of\n            conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on\n            either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that\n            the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of\n            any formula containing that element by the element\xe2\x80\x99s subscript in the formula. If an\n            element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the number of\n            atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both\n            product species in the example reaction, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, contain the\n            element oxygen. To determine the total number of oxygen atoms on the product side we add\n            the 2 atoms of oxygen in the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule to the 2 atoms of oxygen in the 2\n                H<sub>2</sub>O moleucles for a total of 4 oxygen atoms.</p>\n\n        <p>The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and\n            water is confirmed to be balanced per this approach, as shown here:</p>\n\n\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm{CH}}_4\\;+\\;2\\;{\\mathrm\n            O}_2\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\;+\\;2\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O$$</formula>\n        <table>\n\n            <tr>\n                <th>Element</th>\n\n                <th>Reactants</th>\n\n                <th>Products</th>\n\n                <th>Balanced?</th>\n            </tr>\n\n            <tr>\n                <td>C</td>\n\n                <td>1 &times; 1 = 1</td>\n\n                <td>1 &times; 1 = 1</td>\n\n                <td>1 = 1, yes</td>\n            </tr>\n\n            <tr>\n                <td>H</td>\n\n                <td>4 &times; 1 = 4</td>\n\n                <td>2 &times; 2 = 4</td>\n\n                <td>4 = 4, yes</td>\n            </tr>\n\n            <tr>\n                <td>O</td>\n\n                <td>2 &times; 2 = 4</td>\n\n                <td>(1 &times; 2) + (2 &times; 1) = 4</td>\n\n                <td>4 = 4, yes</td>\n            </tr>\n\n        </table>\n        <composite_activity purpose="learnbydoing">\n            <p>Indicate whether the following equations are balanced or unbalanced.</p>\n            <wb:inline idref="balancing_eq_lbd_1" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n        </composite_activity>\n\n        <example>\n            <p>Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and\n                oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form dinitrogen pentoxide.</p>\n\n            <p>First, write the unbalanced equation.</p>\n\n\n            <formula>$${\\mathrm N}_2\\;+\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;{\\mathrm N}_2{\\mathrm\n                O}_5$$</formula>\n            <p>Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.</p>\n\n            <table>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>Element</th>\n\n                    <th> Reactants</th>\n\n                    <th>Products</th>\n\n                    <th>Balanced?</th>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                    <td>N</td>\n\n                    <td>1 &times; 2 = 2</td>\n\n                    <td>1 &times; 2 = 2</td>\n\n                    <td>2 = 2, yes</td>\n                </tr>\n\n                <tr>\n                    <td>O</td>\n\n                    <td>1 &times; 2 = 2</td>\n\n                    <td>1 &times; 5 = 5</td>\n\n                    <td>2 \xe2\x89\xa0 5</td>\n                </tr>\n            </table>\n\n            <p>Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number\n                of oxygen atoms.

When balance is achieved,\n            all the equation\xe2\x80\x99s coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole number to convert the\n            fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example,\n            consider the reaction of ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) with oxygen to yield\n                H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> , represented by the unbalanced equation:</p>\n\n\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm C}_2{\\mathrm H}_6\\;+\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;{\\mathrm\n            H}_2\\mathrm O\\;+\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2$$</formula>\n\n        <p>Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by\n            changing the coefficients for the two product species, as shown:</p>\n\n\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm C}_2{\\mathrm H}_6\\;+\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;3\\;{\\mathrm\n            H}_2\\mathrm O\\;+\\;2\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2$$</formula>\n\n        <p>This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd number\xe2\x80\x94no\n            integer coefficient can be used with the O<sub>2</sub> reactant to yield an odd number,\n            so a fractional coefficient, 7/2, is used instead to yield a provisional balanced\n            equation:</p>\n\n\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm C}_2{\\mathrm H}_6\\;+\\;{\\textstyle\\frac72}\\;{\\mathrm\n            O}_2\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;3\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O\\;+\\;2\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2$$</formula>\n        <p>A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying\n            each coefficient by 2: </p>\n        <formula>$$2\\;{\\mathrm C}_2{\\mathrm H}_6\\;+\\;7\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\;\\;\\rightarrow\\;\\;6\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O\\;+\\;4\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2$$</formula>\n\n        <p>Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the\n            smallest whole-number coefficients.
