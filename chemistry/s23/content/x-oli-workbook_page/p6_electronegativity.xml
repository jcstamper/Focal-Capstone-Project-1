Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an\n            atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the\n            shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an\n            atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in\n            a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more\n            electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the\n            difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the\n            larger the partial charges of the atoms.</p>\n        <p>The periodic table shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one\n            of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling. In general,\n            electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and\n            decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have\n            the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all\n            (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have\n            the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure\n            because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a\n            full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO<sub>2</sub> do exist, they can only be\n            formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model\n            of electronegativity.)</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/pt_electro.jpg" alt="Part of the periodic table is shown.

The\n                    electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the\n                    energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an\n                    electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes\n                    how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity\n                    that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity\n                    values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of\n                    bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4.</p>\n                <wb:inline idref="electroneg_1lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n                <wb:inline idref="electroneg_1digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>             \n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Electronegativity and Bond Type</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (\xce\x94EN) of two bonded\n                    atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and,\n                    thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is\n                    covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic.\n                    The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in\n                    the bonds H\xe2\x80\x93H, H\xe2\x80\x93Cl, and Na\xe2\x80\x93Cl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1\n                    (ionic), respectively.

This table is just\n                    a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example, the H and F atoms\n                    in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3\n                    a difference of 0.9, yet both of these compounds form bonds that are considered\n                    polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl atoms in NaCl have an electronegativity\n                    difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI<sub>2</sub> have a difference\n                    of 1.0, yet both of these substances form ionic compounds.</p>\n                <p>The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the\n                    types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table.\n                    Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and\n                    a nonmetal is often ionic.</p>\n                <p> Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds.

For example, potassium nitrate, KNO<sub>3</sub>, contains the\n                    K<sup>+</sup> cation and the polyatomic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup> anion.\n                    Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic\n                    attraction between the ions K<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup>, as\n                    well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in\n                    NO<sub>3</sub><sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup>. </p>\n                <example>\n                    <p>Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of\n                        proteins.
