Composition of Substances and Solutions,Introduction,Introduction to Composition of Substances and Solutions,"Swimming pools have long been a popular means of recreation, exercise, and physical\n            therapy. Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent\n            basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful\n            bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various\n            chemical compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of\n            calcium ion, Ca2+, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent\n            eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium\n            levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that\n            also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of Ca2+ in\n            the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium\n            level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances (such as the\n            calcium-containing compound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of\n            this unit.",
Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Introduction,Introduction to Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,"It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including\n            graphite and diamonds. But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was\n            recognized: buckminsterfullerene, commonly known as a cbuckyball.d This molecule was\n            named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895), whose\n            signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell\n            structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C\n            60 , and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable\n            molecule. They were guided by bonding theorythe topic of this unitwhich explains\n            how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Introduction ,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties Introduction,"\n            The Crab Nebula consists of remnants of a supernova (the explosion of a\n                star). NASAs Hubble Space Telescope produced this composite image. Measurements\n                of the emitted light wavelengths enabled astronomers to identify the elements in\n                the nebula, determining that it contains specific ions including S+ (green\n                filaments) and O2+ (red filaments). (credit: modification of work by NASA and\n                ESA)\n
In 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of a cguest stard in the sky,\n            visible even during the day, which then disappeared slowly over the next two years. The\n            sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the\n            original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the\n            remaining Crab Nebula continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light\n            but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The\n            nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra\n            (the colored filaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of\n            electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms.\n            We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from\n            thousands of light years away.",
Gases,Introduction,Introduction to Gases,"We are surrounded by an ocean of gasthe atmosphereand many of the properties of gases\n            are familiar to us from our daily activities. Heated gases expand, which can make a hot\n            air balloon rise or cause a blowout in a bicycle tire left in the sun on a hot day.
Gases have played an important part in the development of chemistry. In the seventeenth\n            and eighteenth centuries, many scientists investigated gas behavior, providing the first\n            mathematical descriptions of the behavior of matter.
In this unit, we will examine the relationships between gas temperature, pressure,\n            amount, and volume. We will study a simple theoretical model and use it to analyze the\n            experimental behavior of gases. The results of these analyses will show us the\n            limitations of the theory and how to improve on it.",
Reactions and Stoichiometry,Introduction,Introduction to Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry,"Solid-fuel rockets are a central feature in the worlds space exploration programs,\n            including the new Space Launch System being developed by the National Aeronautics and\n            Space Administration (NASA) to replace the retired Space Shuttle fleet. The engines of\n            these rockets rely on carefully prepared solid mixtures of chemicals combined in\n            precisely measured amounts. Igniting the mixture initiates a vigorous chemical reaction\n            that rapidly generates large amounts of gaseous products. These gases are ejected from\n            the rocket engine through its nozzle, providing the thrust needed to propel heavy\n            payloads into space. Both the nature of this chemical reaction and the relationships\n            between the amounts of the substances being consumed and produced by the reaction are\n            critically important considerations that determine the success of the technology. This\n            unit will describe how to symbolize chemical reactions using chemical equations, how to\n            classify some common chemical reactions by identifying patterns of reactivity, and how\n            to determine the quantitative relations between the amounts of substances involved in\n            chemical reactionsthat is, the reaction stoichiometry.

Solids and Liquids,Introduction,Introduction,"The great distances between atoms and molecules in a gaseous phase, and the corresponding\n            absence of any significant interactions between them, allows for simple descriptions of\n            many physical properties that are the same for all gases, regardless of their chemical\n            identities. As described in the final module on gases, this situation\n            changes at high pressures and low temperaturesconditions that permit the atoms and\n            molecules to interact to a much greater extent. In the liquid and solid states, these\n            interactions are of considerable strength and play an important role in determining a\n            number of physical properties that do depend on the chemical identity of the substance.\n            In this unit, the nature of these interactions and their effects on various physical\n            properties of liquid and solid phases will be examined.",
Solutions,Introduction,Introduction to Solutions,"Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine species. They are being threatened by\n            climate change, oceanic acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the\n            composition of the solution we know as seawater. Dissolved oxygen in seawater is\n            critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the\n            concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon\n            dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are\n            particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the\n            coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of\n            seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to\n            affect our oceans.
Solutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes\n            involving chemical reactions. In this chapter, we will consider the nature of solutions,\n            and examine factors that determine whether a solution will form and what properties it\n            may have. In addition, we will discuss colloidssystems that resemble solutions but\n            consist of dispersions of particles somewhat larger than ordinary molecules or ions.

Thermochemistry,Introduction ,Introduction to Thermochemistry,"Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in\n            energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function\n            without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about 85% of US energy\n            consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We\n            use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw materials,\n            manufactured goods, and people (27%); for industrial production (21%); and to heat and\n            power our homes and businesses (10%). While these combustion reactions help us meet our\n            essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific\n            community as a major contributor to global climate change.
Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than\n            combustion. For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or\n            flashlight results from chemical reactions. This unit introduces many of the basic\n            ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with a\n            focus on thermal energy.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Molecular Compounds,"Many compounds do not contain ions but instead consist solely of discrete, neutral\n            molecules. These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share,\n            rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and\n            extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail later in\n            this course. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical\n            properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases,\n            low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions\n            exist.
Whereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent\n            compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can\n            help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the\n            positions of a compounds elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic\n            or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a\n            very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.\n            Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and youll learn more about\n            those later.
The bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from\n                    ionic compounds, and they are named using a different system as well. The\n                    charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so\n                    specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine\n                    chemical formulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant\n                    variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for\n                    molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.
When two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination\n                    ratios are often possible. For example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds\n                    CO and CO2. Since these are different substances with different\n                    properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called\n                    carbon oxide). To deal with this situation, we use a naming method that is\n                    somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to\n                    specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic\n                    element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is\n                    first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to\n                    the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix ide. The numbers of\n                    atoms of each element are designated by the Greek prefixes shown in the table\n                    below.
When only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- is usually\n                    deleted from that part. Thus, CO is named carbon monoxide, and CO2 is\n                    called carbon dioxide. When two vowels are adjacent, the ""a"" in the Greek prefix\n                    is usually dropped. Some other examples are shown in table below.
There are a few common names that you will encounter as you continue your study\n                    of chemistry. For example, although NO is often called nitric oxide, its proper\n                    name is nitrogen monoxide. Similarly, N2O is known as nitrous oxide even though\n                    our rules would specify the name dinitrogen monoxide. (And H2O is usually called\n                    water, not dihydrogen monoxide.) You should commit to memory the common names of\n                    compounds as you encounter them.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"Macroscopic objects act as particles. Microscopic objects (such as electrons)\n                    have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot\n                    be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the\n                    three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according\n                    to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as \xcf. Atomic\n                    wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the\n                    wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the\n                    electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe\n                    the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.
An atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal\n                    quantum number, n, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of\n                    energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus\n                    are related to n. Orbitals having the same value of n are said to be in the same\n                    shell. The angular momentum quantum number, l, can have any integer value from 0\n                    to n  1. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital.\n                    Orbitals with the same principle quantum number and the same l value belong to\n                    the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml, with 2l + 1 values ranging\n                    from l to +l, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition,\n                    each electron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can be equal to . No two\n                    electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four\n                    quantum numbers.
The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals\n                    are filled (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, and so on). Electron configurations\n                    and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle\n                    (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hunds rule\n                    (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).
Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible\n                    for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements\n                    with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same\n                    group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly\n                    when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table\n                    can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last\n                    electron to be added is placed: main group elements (s and p orbitals),\n                    transition elements (d orbitals), and inner transition elements (f\n                    orbitals).

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Module Summary and Quiz,"Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. \n               Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be \n               represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use the SI (International System) \n               or metric systems. We use base SI units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, \n               such as liters (for volume) and g/cm3 (for density). In many cases, we find it convenient to use unit prefixes \n               that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10-6 seconds) and megahertz (106 hertz), \n               respectively.
Quantities can be exact or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number \n               of significant figures in the measurement. The uncertainty of a calculated value depends on the uncertainties in \n               the values used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Measured values can be accurate \n               (close to the true value) and/or precise (showing little variation when measured repeatedly).
Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured \n               quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors, \n               which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or \n               dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured \n               quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Acids,"Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known\n            as acidssubstances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water. The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail later in this\n            course, but for now, it will suffice to note that many acids release hydrogen ions,\n                H+, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a\n            mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compounds name.
substances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water
If the compound is a binary acidcompound containing two different elements (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic\n                    element) use the steps below to name the acid.
compound containing two different elements
For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the\n                    solution is called hydrochloric acid. Several other examples of this\n                    nomenclature are shown in table below.
Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or\n                    coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you\n                    will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known\n                    as oxyacidscompound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water), compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other\n                    element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the\n                    compound (you will learn the details of this later in this course). Typical\n                    oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion.\n                    To name oxyacids follow the steps below.
compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water)
For example, consider H2CO3 (which you might be tempted to\n                    call chydrogen carbonated). To name this correctly, chydrogend is omitted; the\n                    ate of carbonate is replace with ic; and acid is addedso its name is carbonic\n                    acid. Other examples are given in Table. There are some exceptions to the\n                    general naming method (e.g., H2SO4 is called sulfuric\n                    acid, not sulfic acid, and H2SO3 is sulfurous, not\n                    sulfous, acid).

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature Mixed Practice,"Throughout this course you will encounter many chemical formulas. You will need to be\n            able to identify whether formulas are molecular, ionic, or acids and then be able to\n            name them accordingly. Likewise, when you encounter the name of a compound you need to\n            be able to recognize whether it is ionic, molecular, or an acid and write the chemical\n            formula accordingly. The activities on this page will give you practice on identifying\n            the types of compounds and naming and writing formulas accordingly.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Extra Practice: Elements and Compounds,,
Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Module Summary and Quiz,"Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass\n                    numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the\n                    number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is\n                    composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the\n                    average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the\n                    atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, or two-letter \n                    abbreviations for the atoms.
A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact\n                    numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives\n                    the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula\n                    indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick\n                    and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule.\n                    Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements\n                    of atoms.
The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements\n                    led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged\n                    in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known\n                    as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar\n                    chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and\n                    nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition\n                    metals. Groups are numbered 1 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are\n                    known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals;\n                    those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are\n                    the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.
Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of\n                    electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the\n                    preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged\n                    ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and,\n                    to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed\n                    to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in\n                    the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively\n                    charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions.\n                    Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic\n                    (containing more than one atom).
Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally\n                    form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead\n                    consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms\n                    that behave as a single unit), are called covalent or molecular compounds. Covalent compounds\n                    usually form from two nonmetals.
Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular\n                    compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds\n                    typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written\n                    first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to ide. For\n                    example, K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions\n                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the\n                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and\n                        FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic\n                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular\n                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so\n                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule\n                    of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and\n                        N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important\n                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.\n                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the ide suffix to ic,\n                    and adding cacid;d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the\n                    ending of the anion to ic, and adding cacid;d H2CO3 is\n                    carbonic acid.
Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the Elements and Compounds module and use the\n                    My Response link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.

Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Energy and Phase Changes,"Vaporization is an endothermic process. The cooling effect can be evident when\n                    you leave a swimming pool or a shower. When the water on your skin evaporates,\n                    it removes heat from your skin and causes you to feel cold. The energy change\n                    associated with the vaporization process is the enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap. For example, the vaporization of water\n                    at standard temperature is represented by:
As described in the unit on thermochemistry, the reverse of an endothermic\n                    process is exothermic. And so, the condensation of a gas releases heat:
The amount of heat required to change one mole of a substance from the solid\n                    state to the liquid state is the enthalpy of fusion, \xceHfus of the substance. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.0\n                    kJ/mol at 0 C. Fusion (melting) is an endothermic process:
The reciprocal process, freezing, is an exothermic process whose enthalpy change\n                    is .0 kJ/mol at 0 C:
One way our body is cooled is by evaporation of the water in sweat. In very hot\n                climates, we can lose as much as 1.5 L of sweat per day. Although sweat is not pure\n                water, we can get an approximate value of the amount of heat removed by evaporation\n                by assuming that it is. How much heat is required to evaporate 1.5 L of water (1.5\n                kg) at T = 37 C (normal body temperature); \xceHvap\n                = 43.46 kJ/mol at 37 C.
We start with the known volume of sweat (approximated as just water) and use the\n                given information to convert to the amount of heat needed:
Thus, 3600 kJ of heat are removed by the evaporation of 1.5 L of water.
Like vaporization, the process of sublimation requires an input of energy to\n                    overcome intermolecular attractions. The enthalpy of sublimation, \xceHsub, is the energy required to convert one\n                    mole of a substance from the solid to the gaseous state. For example, the\n                    sublimation of carbon dioxide is represented by:
Consider the extent to which intermolecular attractions must be overcome to\n                    achieve a given phase transition. Converting a solid into a liquid requires that\n                    these attractions be only partially overcome; transition to the gaseous state\n                    requires that they be completely overcome. As a result, the enthalpy of fusion\n                    for a substance is less than its enthalpy of vaporization. This same logic can\n                    be used to derive an approximate relation between the enthalpies of all phase\n                    changes for a given substance. Though not an entirely accurate description,\n                    sublimation may be conveniently modeled as a sequential two-step process of\n                    melting followed by vaporization in order to apply Hesss Law. Viewed in this\n                    manner, the enthalpy of sublimation for a substance may be estimated as the sum\n                    of its enthalpies of fusion and vaporization. For example:

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions: Moles and Particles,"A balanced chemical equation provides a great deal of information in a very succinct\n            format. Chemical formulas provide the identities of the reactants and products involved\n            in the chemical change, allowing classification of the reaction. Coefficients provide\n            the relative numbers of these chemical species, allowing a quantitative assessment of\n            the relationships between the amounts of substances consumed and produced by the\n            reaction. These quantitative relationships are known as the reactions \n                stoichiometry\n                \n                    \n                        relationships between the amounts of reactants and products of a chemical\n                            reaction\n                    \n                \n            , a term derived from the Greek words stoicheion (meaning celementd) and metron\n            (meaning cmeasured). In this module, the use of balanced chemical equations for various\n            stoichiometric applications is explored.
relationships between the amounts of reactants and products of a chemical\n                            reaction
The general approach to using stoichiometric relationships is similar in concept to the\n            way people go about many common activities. Food preparation, for example, offers an\n            appropriate comparison. A recipe for making eight pancakes calls for 1 cup pancake mix,\n            3/4 cup milk, and one egg. The cequationd representing the preparation of pancakes per\n            this recipe is
If two dozen pancakes are needed for a big family breakfast, the ingredient amounts must\n            be increased proportionally according to the amounts given in the recipe. For example,\n            the number of eggs required to make 24 pancakes is
Balanced chemical equations are used in much the same fashion to determine the amount of\n            one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant, or to yield a\n            given amount of product, and so forth. The coefficients in the balanced equation are\n            used to derive \n                stoichiometric factors\n                \n                    \n                        ratio of coefficients in a balanced chemical equation, used in\n                            computations relating amounts of reactants and products\n                    \n                \n             that permit computation of the desired quantity. To illustrate this idea,\n            consider the production of ammonia by reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen:
ratio of coefficients in a balanced chemical equation, used in\n                            computations relating amounts of reactants and products
This equation shows ammonia molecules are produced from hydrogen molecules in a 2:3\n            ratio, and stoichiometric factors may be derived using any amount (number) unit:
These stoichiometric factors can be used to compute the number of ammonia molecules\n            produced from a given number of hydrogen molecules, or the number of hydrogen molecules\n            required to produce a given number of ammonia molecules. Similar factors may be derived\n            for any pair of substances in any chemical equation.
How many moles of I2 are required to react with 0.429 mol of Al according\n                to the following equation?
Referring to the balanced chemical equation, the stoichiometric factor relating the\n                two substances of interest is 3 mol I2 mol/ 2 mol Al. The molar amount of\n                iodine is derived by multiplying the provided molar amount of aluminum by this\n                factor:
We can also use the stoichiometric relationships in a balanced equation to determine the\n            number of particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units) involved in a chemical\n            reaction.
How many carbon dioxide molecules are produced when 0.75 mol of propane is combusted\n                according to this equation?
The approach here is the same as in the previous example, though the absolute number\n                of molecules is requested, not the number of moles of molecules. This will simply\n                require use of the moles-to-numbers conversion factor, Avogadros number.
The balanced equation shows that carbon dioxide is produced from propane in a 3:1\n                ratio:

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Attractive Forces,"As was the case for gaseous substances , the kinetic molecular\n            theory may be used to explain the behavior of solids and liquids. In the following\n            description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion.
Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and\n            gaseous matter:
From everyday experience we know that substances exist in different states of matter\n            under various conditions. For example, water is a liquid at room temperature, a solid at\n            tempertures below 0 oC and a gas at temperatures above 100 oC.\n            Table salt (NaCl) is a solid a room temperature with a very high melting point and\n            boiling point of 800 oC and 1413 oC, respectively. While nitrogen\n                (N2), which is the main component in the air all around us, is a gas at\n            room temperature with a melting point of -210 oC and a boiling point of -196\n                oC.
The difference in the conditions at which a substace is a solid, liquid, or gas reflect\n            the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make\n            up the substance. These attractive forces are either ionic bonds, in the case of ionic\n            compounds, or intermolecular forces (IMFs), in the case of molecular compounds. IMFs are\n            the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a\n            molecular substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module.\n            The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its attractive\n            forces and the kinetic energies (KE) of its particles. The attractive forces serve to\n            hold particles close together, whereas the particles KE provides the energy required to\n            overcome these forces and thus increase the distance between particles.
Consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is cooled sufficiently, the kinetic energy\n            of its molecules decreases and the attractions between the molecules will be capable of\n            holding them together when they come into contact with each other; the gas condenses,\n            forming liquid H2O. When the liquid water is cooled even more, the kinetic\n            energy of its molecules decreases further and the attraction between the molecules will\n            be capable of holding them together in a rigid structure to form solid H2O or\n            ice.
Different substances have widely varying strengths of attractive forces between their\n            particles because of their composition. These attractive forces have a direct impact on\n            boiling points and melting points. In this module, we will explore these attractive\n            forces and their effects. Note that throughout this module we will focus primarily on\n            differences in boiling points, but, by and large, the concepts discussed can also be\n            applied to melting points.

Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Changes in Enthalpy,"Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to\n            describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as\n            the sum of a systems internal energy (E) and the mathematical\n            product of its pressure (P) and volume (V):
Since it is derived from three state functions (E, P, and V), enthalpy is also a state\n            function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only\n            enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes\n            that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical\n            changes), the enthalpy change (\xceH) is:
The mathematical product P\xceV represents\n            work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By\n            their definitions, the arithmetic signs of \xceV and w will always be opposite:
Substituting this equation into the enthalpy-change equation yields:
From definition of internal energy, \xceE = q + w, we then get:
Where the subscript on heat, qp , is included to\n            specify that this is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
If a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the\n                  only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow\n                  (qp) and enthalpy change (\xceH) for the process are\n                      equal.
for processes occurring at constant pressure.
The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of\n            the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially\n            constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction\n            measured in a bomb calorimeter, as discussed previously, is not equal to \xceH because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents\n            expansion work from occurring. Chemists usually perform experiments under normal\n            atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure where q =\n                \xceH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for\n            determining heat.
The following shows how the above conventions apply when we use \xceH for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas: :
When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of\n                NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat is produced. What is \xceH for the following reaction, corresponding to the enthalpy\n                change per mole of acid reacting?
For the reaction of 0.0500 mol HCl acid, q = .9 kJ. This\n                leads us to the ratio\n                    \n                        \n                            .9 kJ\n                            0.0500 mol HCl\n                        \n                    \n                Which can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1\n                mole of HCl reacts:
The enthalpy change when 1 mole of HCl reacts is therefore  kJ. Since in the\n                chemical equation, one mole of HCl reacts, we write the enthalpy of the reaction as:
The following example illustrates that you need to take both stoichiometry and limiting\n            reactants into account when determining the \xceH for a chemical\n            reaction.
A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C12H22O11.\n                When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO3, 43.7 kJ of heat is\n                produced. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.
Moles of C12H22O11 available:
Moles of KClO3 available:

It is common practice to use the smallest possible whole-number coefficients in a\r\n\t\t\tchemical equation, as is done in this example. Realize, however, that these coefficients\r\n\t\t\trepresent the relative numbers of reactants and products, and, therefore, they may be\r\n\t\t\tcorrectly interpreted as ratios.

Likewise, these coefficients\r\n\t\t\tmay be interpreted with regard to any amount (number) unit, and so this equation may be\r\n\t\t\tcorrectly read in many ways, including:
One methane molecule and two oxygen molecules react to yield one carbon dioxide molecule\r\n\t\t\tand two water molecules.
One dozen methane molecules and two dozen oxygen molecules react to yield one dozen\r\n\t\t\tcarbon dioxide molecules and two dozen water molecules.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Chemical Symbols,"Previously we discussed elements and the periodic table. Elements are represented by a\n            chemical symbol. A chemical symbol is an abbreviation that we use to indicate an element\n            or an atom of an element. For example, the symbol for mercury is Hg. We use the same\n            symbol to indicate one atom of mercury (microscopic domain) or to label a container of\n            many atoms of the element mercury (macroscopic domain).
The symbols of all elements are listed on the periodic table of elements.
Notice that the atomic number for each element is listed on the periodic table and that\n            the elements are arranged in order atomic number. We will discuss the periodic table in\n            more detail later in this course.
During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared\n                    to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a cnew\n                    elementd produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the\n                    name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was\n                    chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a\n                    different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other\n                    elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element\n                    could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically\n                    indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopesAtoms of the same element that has different masses due to different numbers of neutrons.atoms of the same\n                    element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in\n                    1921 for this discovery. Later it was determined that the cause of the different\n                    masses between isotopes of the same element is different numbers of\n                    neutrons.
Atoms of the same element that has different masses due to different numbers of neutrons.
The symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass\n                    number as a superscript to the left of the element symbol. The atomic number is\n                    sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol, but since this number\n                    defines the elements identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For\n                    example, magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic\n                    number of 12 and with mass numbers of 24, 25, and 26, respectively. These\n                    isotopes can be identified as 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg. These isotope symbols are\n                    read as celement, mass numberd and can be symbolized consistent with this\n                    reading. For instance, 24Mg is read as cmagnesium 24,d and can be written as\n                    cmagnesium-24d or cMg-24.d 25Mg is read as cmagnesium 25,d and can be written as\n                    cmagnesium-25d or cMg-25.d All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus.\n                    They differ only because a 24Mg atom has 12 neutrons in its nucleus, a 25Mg atom\n                    has 13 neutrons, and a 26Mg has 14 neutrons.

Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Solutions,"An earlier unit introduced solutions, defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more\n            substances. Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater\n            concentration, in which case it is called the solvent. The other components of the\n            solution present in relatively lesser concentrations are called solutes. Sugar is a\n            covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules,\n            C12H22O11. When this compound dissolves in water, its\n            molecules become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water:
The caqd in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are\n            therefore individually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent).\n            Although sucrose molecules are heavier than water molecules, they remain dispersed\n            throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to csettle outd over time.
Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is an ionic compound\n            composed of colorless potassium ions, K+, and orange dichromate ions,\n                Cr2O72. When a small amount of solid potassium\n            dichromate is added to water, the compound dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium\n            ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed throughout the mixture (seen below), as\n            indicated in this equation:
As with the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its\n            solutes, potassium and dichromate ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent\n            (water) molecules.
Water is used so often as a solvent that the word solution has come to imply an aqueous\n            solution to many people. However, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent.\n            Many alloys are solid solutions of one metal dissolved in another; for example, US\n            five-cent coins contain nickel dissolved in copper. Air is a gaseous solution, a\n            homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and several other gases. Oxygen (a gas),\n            alcohol (a liquid), and sugar (a solid) all dissolve in water (a liquid) to form liquid\n            solutions. The table below gives examples of several different solutions and the phases\n            of the solutes and solvents.

Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Early Atomic Theory,"The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, \n            the scientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was \n            composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for cindivisible.d \n            They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, \n            Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four celementsdfire, \n            earth, air, and waterand could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and celementsd \n            as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.
The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John \n            Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic \n            theory. First published in 1807, many of Daltons hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern \n            atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Daltons atomic theory.
Daltons atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that youve \n            learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken \n            down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither \n            created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one \n            type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).\n

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,Electromagnetic Energy,"Electromagnetic energy is transmitted by waves that have electric and magnetic fields\n            oscillating perpendicularly from each other and from the direction the wave propagates\n            or travels, as seen in the animatation below. The electromagnetic spectrum contains waves with a continuous range of\n            energies, frequencies and wavelengths. There are different classifications for the\n            electromagnetic waves in the spectrum, many of which you are likely familiar with\n            including: visible light, cell phone signals, microwaves, X-rays, infrared (IR)\n            radiation, and gamma rays.
Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation. For example, radio\n            waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food in your\n            microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television\n            screen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.
Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in\n            chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and\n            molecules. In this section we will explore the nature of electromagnetic energy, and\n            in following sections we will see how the theories about electromagnetic energy are used\n            to help describe the electronic structure of the atom.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Exploring Electron and Molecular Geometry,"Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules.\n                    However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important\n                    to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, angles, and\n                    relative arrangements in space. A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds\n                    that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or\n                    bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the\n                    straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in ngstroms (1 \n                    = 10 m) or picometers (1 pm = 10 m, 100 pm = 1\n                    ).
Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict\n                    the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central\n                    atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron\n                    pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the\n                    valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes\n                    repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them.\n                    The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs\n                    of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The\n                    electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions\n                    of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as\n                    possible.
VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom\n                    and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should\n                    understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions.\n                    Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron\n                    attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a\n                    particular molecular structure.
As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous\n                        BeF2 molecule. The Lewis structure of BeF2 shows only\n                    two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone\n                    pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible,\n                    and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density\n                    is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. The\n                    bond angle is 180.
In the activity below, you will explore the three dimensional shapes that\n                    molecules take based on VSEPR theory. In this first activity, we will look at\n                    electron pair geometries in which the shapes are determined by the total number\n                    of pairs of electrons surrounding the central atom. Fill in the tables as\n                    directed.

As you build the different electron geometry shapes in this activity, note\n                        that you are able to move the shape around to better see the shape in 3\n                        dimensions.

Each of the molecules in the table below is one of the molecules you can\n                        chose from the pull down menu in the simulation. Chose each of the molecules\n                        and fill in the appropriate information in the table.
It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not\n                    the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries\n                    (electron geometries) you determined in the previous activities describe all\n                    regions where electrons are located around the central atom. Molecular structure\n                    describes the location of the atoms around the central atom, not the\n                    electrons.
We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that\n                    includes all electron pairs the electron-pair geometry or electron geometry. The\n                    structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is\n                    called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as\n                    the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the\n                    central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on\n                    the central atom.
For example, the methane molecule, CH4, which is the major component\n                    of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon\n                    atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure.\n                    On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH3, also has four electron\n                    pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral\n                    electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is\n                    not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape\n                    of the molecule.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Periodic Variations in Element Properties,"The elements in groups (vertical columns) of the periodic table exhibit similar chemical\n            behavior. This similarity occurs because the members of a group have the same number and\n            distribution of electrons in their valence shells. However, there are also other\n            patterns in chemical properties on the periodic table. For example, as we move down a\n            group, the metallic character of the atoms increases. Oxygen, at the top of group 16\n            (6A), is a colorless gas; in the middle of the group, selenium is a semiconducting\n            solid; and, toward the bottom, polonium is a silver-grey solid that conducts\n            electricity.
As we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an\n            electron to the valence shell with each successive element. As we go down the elements\n            in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remains constant, but the\n            principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of the electronic\n            structure of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their\n            chemical behavior. These properties vary periodically as the electronic structure of the\n            elements changes. The periodic properties we will examine in this module are:
(1) size (radius) of atoms and ions,
(2) ionization energies, and
(3) electron affinities.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Formula Mass,"Earlier we described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average\r\n\t\t\tatomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of\r\n\t\t\tsubstances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance by\r\n\t\t\tsumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substances\r\n\t\t\tformula.
For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcorrectly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnow primarily used in the production of the canti-stickd polymer, Teflon. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmolecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains one\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcarbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecular\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the average\r\n\t\t\t\t\tatomic masses of these atoms. The table below outlines the calculations used to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tderive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.

Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and the\r\n\t\t\t\tactive ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Advil\r\n\t\t\t\tand Motrin. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound?
Molecules of this compound are comprised of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2\r\n\t\t\t\toxygen atoms. Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass for\r\n\t\t\t\tthis compound is therefore:
Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tyield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compound\r\n\t\t\t\t\tis calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: by\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compounds formula.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tKeep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tas the cmolecular mass.d
As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common table\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsalt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNa+, and chloride anions, Cl, combined in a 1:1\r\n\t\t\t\t\tratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu.
Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ionic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various water\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpurification processes. What is the formula mass (amu) of this compound?
The formula for this compound indicates it contains Al3+ and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ions combined in a 2:3 ratio. For purposes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof computing a formula mass, it is helpful to rewrite the formula in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsimpler format, Al2S3O12. Following the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tapproach outlined above, the formula mass for this compound is calculated as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfollows:

Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Pressure,"The earths atmosphere exerts a pressure, as does\r\n\t\t\tany other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric pressure, we are sensitive\r\n\t\t\tto pressure changesfor example, when your ears cpopd during take-off and landing while\r\n\t\t\tflying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gas\r\n\t\t\tmolecules colliding with the surfaces of objects. Although the force of each collision\r\n\t\t\tis very small, any surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisions\r\n\t\t\tin a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air pressure is\r\n\t\t\tstrong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from inside\r\n\t\t\tthe container.
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the\r\n\t\t\tcolumn of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object, such as the tanker car. At\r\n\t\t\tsea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown African\r\n\t\t\telephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. If\r\n\t\t\tyou actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twice\r\n\t\t\tthe usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.
In general, pressure is defined as the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tforce exerted on a given area: \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t=\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t. Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tamount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure can\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbe decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area.
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(Pa), with 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 , where N is the newton, a unit of force\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined as 1 kg m/s2. One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tit is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) or bar (1 bar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t= 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tforce on an area of one square inchpounds per square inch (psi)for example, in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcar tires. Pressure can also be measured using the unit atmosphere (atm), which\r\n\t\t\t\t\toriginally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximate\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlatitude of Paris (45).
The most commonly used units in this course\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare kPa, atm, and mmHg or torr. The unit of mmHg refers to pressure measured in\r\n\t\t\t\t\ta barometer, which we will discuss shortly. At standard atmospheric pressure or\r\n\t\t\t\t atm the height of a column of mercury in a barometer is 760 mm. A torr is a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tunit that can be used interchangeably with mmHg, named after Evangelista\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTorricelli, inventor of the barometer.
The US Weather Service reports air\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure in inches of mercury. If the pressure is reported on a particular\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tday as 29.5 in. Hg, what is the pressure in units of atm? (1 inch = 2.54\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcm)
Here we will use a multi-step\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdimensional analysis to make the conversion.
A typical barometric pressure in Kansas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCity is 742 torr. What is this pressure in kilopascals?
Remember that a torr is the same as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmmHg. We will use the following steps to make the conversion:",Reference: The Periodic Table of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tElements
Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,"Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat","Thermal energykinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and\n            molecules. Temperatureintensive property of matter that is a quantitative measure of chotnessd and ccoldnessd is a quantitative measure of chotd or ccold.d When the atoms and\n            molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average\n            kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is chot.d When the atoms and molecules\n            are moving slowly, they have lower KE, and we say that the object is ccoldd. Assuming\n            that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs,\n            increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature\n            to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as\n            condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of\n            matter will cause its temperature to decrease.

Heattransfer of thermal energy between two bodies (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at\n            different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases\n            the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we\n            initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low\n            temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a\n            higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L,\n            the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The\n            temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the\n            temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules.\n            Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature.

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A\n            change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion\n            reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that releases heatthis\n            process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torchs flame. A\n            reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that absorbs heat. A cold pack used to\n            treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances\n            in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the\n            resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Introduction to Aqueous Solutions,"In preceding sections, we focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter\n            that contain only one type of element or compound. However, mixturessamples of matter\n            containing two or more substances physically combinedare more commonly encountered in\n            nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition\n            of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount\n            of oxygen in a planets atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The\n            relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known\n            as an calloyd) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative\n            amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving\n            the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage\n            determines its sweetness. In this section, we will describe one of the most common ways\n            in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.
We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the\n                    composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout\n                    its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been\n                    implemented in many forms of man-made technology. Here we will introduce some of\n                    the basic properties of solutions.
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration.\n                    Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentrationquantitative measure of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present in a solution\n                    that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component\n                    is called the solventsolution component present in a concentration that is higher relative to other components and may be viewed as the medium in which the other\n                    components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent\n                    are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the\n                    solvent is called an aqueous solutionsolution for which water is the solvent. Water has the ability to dissolve many\n                    different types of substances. Because of this, it is often referred to as the\n                    universal solvent.

A solutesolution component present in a concentration less than that of the solvent is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower\n                    concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with\n                    qualitative terms such as dilutequalitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively low concentration (of relatively low concentration) and\n                    concentratedqualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively high concentration (of relatively high concentration).

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Introduction to Colligative Properties,"The properties of a solution are different from those of either the pure solute(s) or\n            solvent. Many solution properties are dependent upon the chemical identity of the\n            solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is more acidic, a\n            solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a\n            solution of sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that\n            depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their\n            identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point\n            elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties\n            is of central importance to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as\n            will be described in this module.

Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,How to Use the OLI Course,"This course is thoughtfully designed (relying heavily on research-based principles of\n            learning science) to guide you through your learning of General \n                Chemistry. Understanding how and why the course is set-up as it is will help you better\n            utilize all aspects of the course and allow you to more successfully and efficiently learn\n            the concepts.
One of the first things you will notice as you begin is that at the top of every\n                    core content page there are one or more learning objectives.
Learning Objectives appear at the top of the page to guide your learning.
These learning objectives are intended to guide you as to what you should be\n                    accomplishing on that page(s). It is a good idea to make a mental note of, or even write\n                    down, these learning objectives and reflect on them as you are going through the\n                    content. Ask yourself, ""Am I achieving this objective?""
There are many activities throughout this course. The activities are\n                    designed to more fully engage you in the learning process. You will notice there\n                    are two categories of activities within the modules: Learn By\n                        Doing and Did I Get This. These types of\n                    activities are designed in different ways, each for a unique purpose.
The Learn By Doing activities are designed to\n                            scaffold your learning. They provide significantly more guidance than\n                            the Did I Get This activities in a number of\n                            ways. One of the more obvious methods of guidance is hints. You will\n                            notice that many of these activities have hints. If you are unsure how\n                            to approach a problem, ask for a hint to guide you. Note that some\n                            problems have multiple hints.
Learn By Doing activities scaffold practice. Ask for a hint if you are unsure how to progress.\n
An additional way you will see that Learn By\n                            Doing activities help to scaffold learning is to present\n                            problems in a step-by-step manner. Learn By\n                                Doing activities are usually presented before Did I Get This activities.
Some Learn By Doing activities present problem solving in a \n                                step-by-step manner \n                                to scaffold practice.\n                                \n
The Did I Get This activities are designed to be\n                            a self-assessment. Problems generally do not include hints and are\n                            generally not presented in a step-wise manner. This is your opportunity\n                            to determine after reading through the material and performing the\n                            numerous activities that preceded, whether or not you ""got"" the concept.\n                            In the event that you feel that you have not ""gotten"" the concept, it is\n                            a good idea to go back and review the previous material and/or seek help\n                            from your instructor.
Did I get this activities allow you to self-assess your understanding before a graded assignment. \n
My Response activity links are at the end of each\n                            module. These activities allow you to reflect on how well you learned\n                            the concepts presented.

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,International System of Units,"Measurements provide the macroscopic information that is the basis of most of the\n            hypotheses, theories, and laws that describe the behavior of matter and energy in both\n            the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three\n            kinds of information:
While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the\n            uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented\n            and will be discussed later. The number in the measurement can be represented in\n            different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation.
Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for\n            measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of\n            the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees\n            to be 1 liter. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life\n            threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patients seizures\n            and states a dosage of d without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing\n            to the medical professional giving the dose, but also the consequences can be dire: 100 mg\n            given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of\n            100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.
We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version\n            of the metric system, using the units listed in table below. Other units can be derived\n            from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international\n            agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the\n            French, Le Systme International dUnits). SI units have been used by the United States\n            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964.
Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream\n                    is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons\n                    (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but\n                    these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI\n                    units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a\n                    length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means\n                    cone thousand,d which in scientific notation is 103 (1 kilometer =\n                    1000 m = 103 m). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are\n                    raised are listed in table below.
The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI\n                    system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original\n                    standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and\n                    eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units\n                    commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent\n                    units.
The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the\n                    meter (m). A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from\n                    the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a\n                    vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer\n                    than a yard (Figure); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer\n                    distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 103 m),\n                    whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m =\n                        10-2 m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10-3 m).
The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). The kilogram was\n                    previously defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry\n                    (IUPAC) as the mass of a specific reference object. This object was originally\n                    one liter of pure water, and more recently it was a metal cylinder made from a\n                    platinum-iridium alloy with a height and diameter of 39 mm. In May\n                    2019, this definition was changed to one that is based instead on precisely\n                    measured values of several fundamental physical constants. One kilogram is\n                    about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass of the\n                    kilogram (10 kg).
Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin\n                    (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K\n                    (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word cdegreed nor the degree\n                    symbol (°). The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system,\n                    with both the word cdegreed and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements.\n                    Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales\n                    place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C) and\n                    boils at 373.15 K (100 °C) by definition, and normal human body temperature\n                    is approximately 310 K (37 °C). The conversion between these two units and\n                    the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this module.
The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be\n                    expressed with the appropriate prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003\n                    s = 3 × 10-6 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5 ×\n                        106 s. Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Ionic Bond Formation,"Chemical bonding is the force of attraction that holds two or more atoms\n                    together. Chemical bonding is the result of atoms gaining, losing, or sharing\n                    valence electrons. Ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound form from the transfer of electrons from one atom\n                    to another to form positively and negatively charged ions. Covalent bondsbond formed when electrons are shared between atoms form\n                    when two or more atoms share electrons. But why do atoms have this tendency to\n                    gain, lose, or share electrons to form compounds? The answer has to do with the\n                    stability of electron configurations. The most stable arrangement of electrons\n                    is when the outer shell is full. With the exception of the  first shell which\n                    is full with two electrons, all of the other shells are full with eight\n                    electrons. It is important to recognize that when the outer shell is full this\n                    corresponds to the electron configuration of a noble gas. From this general\n                    observation comes a very important concept of chemical bonding the Octet Ruleguideline that states main group atoms will form structures in which eight valence electrons interact with each nucleus, counting bonding electrons as interacting with both atoms connected by the bond.\n                    Main group elements will gain, lose, or share electrons in order to obtain the\n                    electron configuration of a noble gas.

Previously, we discussed the basic concepts of ionic and covalent bonding. In\n                    this unit, we will look at chemical bonding in more detail, beginning here with\n                    ionic bonding.
As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A\n                    cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons\n                    from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom\n                    gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.
Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their\n                    constituent ions are held together by ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound: electrostatic forces of\n                    attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of\n                    ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids\n                    exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend\n                    to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are\n                    very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same\n                    reasonthe strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid\n                    state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or\n                    melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because\n                    the ions can move about freely.

Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical\n                    properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that\n                    burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form\n                    chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to\n                    most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction\n                    between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline compound\n                    sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride\n                    anions. The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely\n                    different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is\n                    poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react\n                    vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.
Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms\n                    the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a\n                    binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in\n                    terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have\n                    relatively low ionization energies and lose electrons easily. The lower the IE\n                    the more easily the atom loses electrons and the more chemically reactive. The\n                    most chemically reactive metals are in the lower left of the periodic table.\n                    Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain\n                    electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. The most\n                    chemically reactive nonmetals are found in the upper-right corner of the\n                    periodic table not including the noble gases. The noble gases have very high\n                    ionization energies and very low electron affinities. With only a few\n                    exceptions, the noble gases do not form chemical bonds and are extremely\n                    unreactive.
As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive\n                    charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of\n                    negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the\n                    simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of\n                    positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide,\n                        Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound contains two\n                    aluminum cations, Al3+, for every three oxide anions, O2\n                    [thus, (2  +3) + (3  ) = 0].
It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not\n                    represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a\n                    sodium chloride (NaCl) cmoleculed because there is not a single ionic bond, per\n                    se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces\n                    between ions are isotropicthe same in all directionsmeaning that any\n                    particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite\n                    charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound,\n                    three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a\n                    regular arrangement of equal numbers of Na+ cations and\n                        Cl anions.

Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,"The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are\n            empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The\n            mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases\n            at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships\n            that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these\n            relationships.
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively\n            explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is\n            based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term cmoleculed will\n            be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some\n            gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)
The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the\n            behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT,\n            which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately\n            represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws\n            (Boyles, Charless, Gay-Lussac\'s, Avogadros, and Daltons laws) conceptually to see\n            how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships\n            between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain\n            Grahams law.
Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends\n            directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we\n            see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas. In the following series of\n            activities use your knowledge of the gas laws to answer the following questions, thereby\n            making the connection as to how the KMT explains the observations that result in the gas\n            laws.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Lewis Symbols,"Thus far in this unit, we have discussed the various types of bonds that form between\n            atoms and/or ions. In all cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence\n            shell electrons between atoms. In this module, we will explore the typical method for\n            depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely Lewis symbolssymbol for an element or monatomic ion that uses a dot to represent each valence electron in the element or ion and Lewis structuresdiagram showing lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons in a molecule or an ion.

We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic\n            ions. A Lewis symbol consists of an elemental symbol surrounded by one dot for each of\n            its valence electrons:
The table below shows the Lewis symbols for the elements of the third period of the\n            periodic table.
Lewis symbols can also be used to illustrate the formation of cations from atoms, as\n            shown here for sodium and calcium:

A \n                        liquid\n                        \n                            \n                                State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite\n                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.\n                            \n                        \n                     flows and takes the shape of a container, except that it forms a flat\n                    or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity,\n                    liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes\n                    that are very nearly independent of pressure. A \n                        gas\n                        \n                            \n                                State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take\n                                    on the shape and volume of its container.\n                            \n                        \n                     takes both the shape and volume of its container.
State of matter that has a definite shape and definite\n                                    volume.
State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite\n                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.
State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take\n                                    on the shape and volume of its container.
Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases\n                    at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small\n                    pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is\n                    composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of\n                    more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to\n                    behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny\n                    particles of water (liquid or solid).
A fourth state of matter, plasma\n                    \n                        \n                            A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of\n                                electrically charged particles.\n                        \n                    \n                , occurs naturally in the interiors of stars and\n                    other high temperature situations. Like gases, plasmas are less dense than\n                    liquids or solids and do not have a fixed shape or volume. But unlike gases,\n                    plasmas contain significant amounts of electrically charged particles that are\n                    able to move freely. Due to these mobile charged particles, plasmas are very\n                    conductive and highly responsive to external electric or magnetic fields. In\n                    addition to stars, plasmas are found in neon signs, plasma TVs, lightning and\n                    the plasma torch (shown in the image below being used to cut through metal).
A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of\n                                electrically charged particles.
The \n                        mass\n                        \n                            \n                                The measure of the amount of matter of an object.\n                            \n                        \n                     of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to\n                    measure an objects mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the\n                    object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the\n                    car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is\n                    to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.
The measure of the amount of matter of an object.
Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. \n                        Weight\n                        \n                            \n                                The force that gravity exerts on an object.\n                            \n                        \n                     refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is\n                    directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes\n                    as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronauts mass does\n                    not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only\n                    one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moons gravity is only one-sixth\n                    that of the earths.
The force that gravity exerts on an object.
The \n                        law of conservation of matter\n                        \n                            \n                                There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when\n                                    matter is converted from one type to another.\n                            \n                        \n                     summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that\n                    there is no change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts\n                    from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or\n                    gaseous states (a physical change). This can be seen in a lead-acid car battery:\n                    The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable\n                    of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and\n                    water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of\n                    matter.
There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when\n                                    matter is converted from one type to another.
Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter,\n                    convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled\n                    conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is\n                    produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and\n                    assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But\n                    because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted\n                    as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.

Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Phase Changes,"When a liquid is heated the kinetic energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions\n                    increases. At some point the KE is great enough to overcome the forces holding\n                    the substance together in the liquid phase and the particles escape into the gas\n                    phase. This is called vaporization. If a gaseous substance is cooled, at some\n                    point, it will change into its liquid phase. This is known as condensation.
When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms,\n                    molecules, or ions and the solid gets hotter. At some point, the added energy\n                    becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or\n                    ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of\n                    transitioning to the liquid state, or melting. If we cool a liquid, the kinetic\n                    energy decreases. At some point, the IMFs will become greater than the KE and\n                    the substance will be held tightly together in a fixed position, which we call\n                    freezing.
Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid\n                    state, via a process known as sublimation. At room temperature and standard\n                    pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to\n                    gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. \n                    When solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms\n                    as seen in the image below. The reverse of sublimation is called deposition, a process in which\n                    gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid\n                    state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition.

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Crystalline vs. Amorphous Solids,"When most liquids are cooled, they eventually freeze and form crystalline solids, solids\n            in which the atoms, ions, or molecules are arranged in a definite repeating pattern. It\n            is also possible for a liquid to freeze before its molecules become arranged in an\n            orderly pattern. The resulting materials are called amorphous solids or noncrystalline\n            solids (or, sometimes, glasses). The particles of such solids lack an ordered internal\n            structure and are randomly arranged.
Metals and ionic compounds typically form ordered, crystalline solids. Substances that\n            consist of large molecules, or a mixture of molecules whose movements are more\n            restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids\n            composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide (shown\n            below), can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions\n            under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the\n            crystalline state under appropriate conditions.

Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP),"The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most\n            fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely\n            regarded as the cfather of modern chemistry,d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a\n            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation\n            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the\n            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He\n            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,\n            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, cIt took the mob only a moment\n            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.
As described in an earlier in this course, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for\n            answers to many of the questions that ask cHow much?d We can answer the question with\n            masses of substances or volumes of solutions. However, we can also answer this question\n            another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the\n            pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the\n            ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal\n            with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions\n            involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will\n            provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already\n            discussed.

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of\n                    molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and\n                    temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a standard temperature\n                        and pressure (STP)standard temperature\n                            and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm\n                    (101.325 kPa). At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 Lthis is\n                    referred to as the standard molar volumevolume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally.
standard temperature\n                            and pressure (STP)
volume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally
One mole of any gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 L.
*Note that this relationship ONLY applies when the gas is at STP.
We can calculate the molar volume of a gas by using the ideal gas law.
What is the volume of 1.00 mol of He at a pressure of 1.00 atm and 273.15\n                        K?
$$\\require{cancel} V = \\frac{(1.00 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206\n                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\\n                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(273.15 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1.00\n                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}} = 22.4 \\mathrm{L}$$
Recognize that the answer in the above example would have been the same\n                    regardless of the type of gas identified in the problem. 1 mole of ANY gas at\n                    STP has a volume of This provides a simple conversion factor to use in\n                    situations when gases are at STP.
A 4.9 g sample of methane, CH4, gas is at standard temperature and\n                        pressure. What volume does the sample occupy?
Notice here that the amount of gas is given in grams. We will need to convert\n                        from grams to moles and then use the relationship between moles and volume\n                        of gas at STP to convert to volume.
$$\\mathrm{g} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{mol} \\rightarrow\n                            \\mathrm{L}$$
$$4.9 \\mathrm{\\cancel{g\\ CH_4}} \\times \\frac{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\\n                            CH_4}}}{16.05 \\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ CH_4}}} \\times \\frac{22.4 \\mathrm{L\\\n                            CH_4}}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ CH_4}}} = 6.84 \\mathrm{L}$$
The molar volume of a gas can also be applied to more complex stoichiometry\n                    problems involving reactions. We can add volume of gases to our stoichiometry\n                    flowchart that we saw earlier.
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas. Zinc reacts with\n                        hydrochloric acid according to the reactions below.
5.8 g of zinc is reacted with an excess amount hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen\n                        gas produced is collected at STP. What is the volume of the hydrogen\n                        gas?
We will use the following steps to solve this problem according to our\n                        flowchart above:

Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Introduction to Thermochemistry,"Chemical changes and their accompanying changes in energy are important parts of our\n            everyday world. The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo\n            metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a\n            variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation,\n            heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous\n            amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then\n            used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers,\n            and bridges.
Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides\n            the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the\n            worlds energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store\n            incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are\n            both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through\n            photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant\n            products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that\n            comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants.\n            Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized\n            plant and animal matter.
This unit will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with\n            the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changesan area\n            called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in this unit are widely used in almost\n            all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy\n            content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the\n            metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Introduction to Valence Bond Theory,"As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural\n            laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain\n            experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained\n            widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are\n            consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules.\n            However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.
There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use\n            quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are\n            likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p\n            orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free\n            atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe\n            the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete\n            understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the\n            electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms\n            when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the\n            nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are\n            described by valence bond theory and hybridization.
Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled\n                    atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of\n                    electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two\n                    different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second\n                    orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a\n                    covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom\n                    overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each\n                    orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this\n                    negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei\n                    serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent\n                    bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the\n                    orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are\n                    stronger than those that have less overlap.
The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. The slideshow\n                    below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored\n                    curve) changes as they approach each other.
The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the\n                    bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity\n                    of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of\n                    energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in the\n                    slideshow, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is 7.24  10 J lower in\n                    energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number.\n                    However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond\n                    energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24\n                     10 J to break one HH bond, but it takes 4.36  105 J to break 1 mole of\n                    HH bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in the table\n                    below. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table\n                    provides average values. For example, breaking the first CH bond in CH4, methane, \n                    requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first CH bond in H (toluene, a common\n                    paint thinner) requires 375.5 kJ/mol.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Wave-Particle Duality of Matter,"Bohrs model explained the experimental data for the hydrogen atom and was widely\n\t\t\t\t\taccepted, but it also raised many questions. Why did electrons orbit at only\n\t\t\t\t\tfixed distances defined by a single quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, but\n\t\t\t\t\tnever in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen and\n\t\t\t\t\tone-electron ions, but could not correctly predict the emission spectrum for\n\t\t\t\t\thelium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed to\n\t\t\t\t\tcompletely revise the way they thought about matter.
We know how matter behaves in the macroscopic worldobjects that are large enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard\n\t\t\t\t\tball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a\n\t\t\t\t\tstraight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is\n\t\t\t\t\tacted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined\n\t\t\t\t\tposition and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, p = mv) at any given moment.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the\n\t\t\t\t\ttypical behavior of a classical object.
When waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example,\n\t\t\t\t\tinteracting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patters\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar to those shown in the image below. This is a case of wave behavior on\n\t\t\t\t\tthe macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent phenomena in the macroscopic realm.
As technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world\n\t\t\t\t\tin greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small\n\t\t\t\t\tpieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large\n\t\t\t\t\tobjects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the\n\t\t\t\t\tcase for the microscopic world.
One of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmicroscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If\n\t\t\t\t\telectromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and\n\t\t\t\t\tother submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral\n\t\t\t\t\tdissertation, de Broglie extended the waveparticle duality of light that\n\t\t\t\t\tEinstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles.\n\t\t\t\t\tHe predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linear\n\t\t\t\t\tmomentum p) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value\n\t\t\t\t\t\xce\xbb, given by this expression in which h is the familiar Plancks constant:
$$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}$$
This is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of \xce\xbb discussed\n\t\t\t\t\tearlier, the de Broglie wavelength is a characteristic of particles and other\n\t\t\t\t\tbodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this equation involves velocity\n\t\t\t\t\t[v, m/s], not frequency [\xce\xbd, Hz]). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as\n\t\t\t\t\tbeing a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie argued\n\t\t\t\t\tthat Bohrs assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is\n\t\t\t\t\tconsidered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that\n\t\t\t\t\tonly an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit.
If an electron travels at a velocity of 1.000  107 m/s and has a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmass of 9.109  10-28 g, what is its wavelength?
We can use de Broglies equation to solve this problem, but we first must do\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta unit conversion of Plancks constant. You learned earlier that 1 J = 1 kg\n\t\t\t\t\t/s2. Thus, we can write h = 6.626 \n\t\t\t\t\t-34 J s as 6.626  10-34 kg m2/s.
$$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}$$
\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$$\\lambda = \\frac{6.626\\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(9.109\\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{kg})(1.000\\times 10^7 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}$$\n\t\t\t\t\t
$$\\lambda = 7.274 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m}$$
This is a small value, but it is significantly larger than the size of an\n\t\t\t\t\t\telectron in the classical (particle) view. This size is the same order of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmagnitude as the size of an atom. This means that electron wavelike behavior\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis going to be noticeable in an atom.
Shortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at\n\t\t\t\t\tBell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally\n\t\t\t\t\tthat electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern\n\t\t\t\t\tfor electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The\n\t\t\t\t\tregularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference\n\t\t\t\t\texperiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be\n\t\t\t\t\tsimilar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern\n\t\t\t\t\tto form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their cslits,d\n\t\t\t\t\tsince the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as\n\t\t\t\t\tthe de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. In the image below,\n\t\t\t\t\tpart a shows an interference pattern. The waveparticle duality of matter can be\n\t\t\t\t\tseen in diagrams below by observing what happens if electron collisions are\n\t\t\t\t\trecorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have\n\t\t\t\t\tbeen recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small\n\t\t\t\t\tlocalized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived\n\t\t\t\t\tand were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike\n\t\t\t\t\tbehavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized\n\t\t\t\t\tparticles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by\n\t\t\t\t\tclassical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation\n\t\t\t\t\tthat governs a probability distribution even for a single electrons motion.\n\t\t\t\t\tThus the waveparticle duality first observed with photons is actually a\n\t\t\t\t\tfundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Atomic Mass,"Because each proton and each neutron contribute\r\n\t\t\tapproximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron contributes far less,\r\n\t\t\tthe atomic massaverage mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a whole\r\n\t\t\tnumber). However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbers\r\n\t\t\tbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomic\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturally\r\n\t\t\t\t\toccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individual\r\n\t\t\t\t\tisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of two\r\n\t\t\tisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,\r\n\t\t\tand the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The average\r\n\t\t\tatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boron\r\n\t\t\tatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, and\r\n\t\t\tindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

While you can easily look up the atomic mass of\r\n\t\t\t\tany element on the periodic table, it is important you understand how the value for\r\n\t\t\t\tthe atomic mass is calculated.
Naturally occurring chlorine consists of\r\n\t\t\t\t Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),\r\n\t\t\t\twith an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in terms\r\n\t\t\t\tof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fraction\r\n\t\t\t\tthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction that\r\n\t\t\t\tis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is\r\n\t\t\t\t Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by\r\n\t\t\t.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + the\r\n\t\t\t\tfraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37\r\n\t\t\t\tCl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average mass\r\n\t\t\t\tequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which means\r\n\t\t\t\tthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cl\r\n\t\t\t\tand 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a mass\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmedicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help\r\n\t\t\t\t\tidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttypically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to an\r\n\t\t\t\t\textent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\trelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mass\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern\r\n\t\t\t\t\tatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in\r\n\t\t\t\t\ta wide range of applications.
Based on the information in the mass\r\n\t\t\t\t\tspectra for zirconium in the image above, we can determine that there are 5\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnaturally occurring isotopes of zirconium, Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr, and Zr\r\n\t\t\t\t\teach with an approximate percent abundance as seen in the table below.

Reactions and Stoichiometry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Chemical Equations,"The chemical equation on the previous page is a balanced equation, meaning that equal\n            numbers of atoms for each element involved in the reaction are represented on the\n            reactant and product sides.
This is a requirement the equation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of\n            conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on\n            either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that\n            the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of\n            any formula containing that element by the elements subscript in the formula. If an\n            element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the number of\n            atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both\n            product species in the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the\n            element oxygen. To determine the total number of oxygen atoms on the product side we add\n            the 2 atoms of oxygen in the CO2 molecule to the 2 atoms of oxygen in the 2\n                H2O moleucles for a total of 4 oxygen atoms.
The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and\n            water is confirmed to be balanced per this approach, as shown here:
Indicate whether the following equations are balanced or unbalanced.
Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N2) and\n                oxygen (O2) to form dinitrogen pentoxide.
First, write the unbalanced equation.
Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.
Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number\n                of oxygen atoms. To balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt\n                would be to change the coefficients for the O2 and\n                    N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least\n                common multiple for the O atom subscripts in these two formulas).
The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the\n                coefficient for the reactant N2 to 2.
The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the\n                equation is balanced.

It is sometimes convenient to use fractions instead of integers as intermediate\n            coefficients in the process of balancing a chemical equation. When balance is achieved,\n            all the equations coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole number to convert the\n            fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example,\n            consider the reaction of ethane (C2H6) with oxygen to yield\n                H2O and CO2 , represented by the unbalanced equation:
Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by\n            changing the coefficients for the two product species, as shown:
This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd numberno\n            integer coefficient can be used with the O2 reactant to yield an odd number,\n            so a fractional coefficient, 7/2, is used instead to yield a provisional balanced\n            equation:
A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying\n            each coefficient by 2:
Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the\n            smallest whole-number coefficients. Although the equation for the reaction between\n            molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to produce ammonia is, indeed, balanced,
the coefficients are not the smallest possible integers representing the relative numbers\n            of reactant and product molecules. Dividing each coefficient by the greatest common\n            factor, 3, gives the preferred equation:
The physical states of reactants and products in chemical equations very often\n                    are indicated with a parenthetical abbreviation following the formulas. Common\n                    abbreviations include s for solids, l for liquids, g for gases, and aq for\n                    substances dissolved in water (aqueous solutions, as introduced in the preceding\n                    chapter). These notations are illustrated in the example equation here:
This equation represents the reaction that takes place when sodium metal is\n                    placed in water. The solid sodium reacts with liquid water to produce molecular\n                    hydrogen gas and the ionic compound sodium hydroxide (a solid in pure form, but\n                    readily dissolved in water).
Special conditions necessary for a reaction are sometimes designated by writing a\n                    word or symbol above or below the equations arrow. For example, a reaction\n                    carried out by heating may be indicated by the uppercase Greek letter delta (\xce)\n                    over the arrow.

Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Chemical Stoichiometry and Gases,"Sometimes we can take advantage of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsimplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnot exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmolecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcoefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasured at the same temperature and pressure.
We can extend Avogadros law (that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvolume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tchemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto produce ammonia gas according to N2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) f 2\r\n\t\t\t\t\t (g), a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressure and temperature remain constant.

Propane, C3H8\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(g), is used in gas grills to provide the heat for cooking. What volume of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t (g) measured at 25 C and 760 torr is required to react\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith 2.7 L of propane measured under the same conditions of temperature and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure? Assume that the propane undergoes complete combustion.
The ratio of the volumes of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tH 8 and O2 will be equal to the ratio\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof their coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction:
From the equation, we see that one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolume of C3H8 will react with five volumes of O2 :
$$\\require{cancel} 2.7\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{L\\ C_3H_8}} \\times \\frac{5 \\mathrm{L\\ O_2}}{1\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{L\\ C_3H_8}}} = 13.5 \\mathrm{L\\ O_2}$$
A volume of 13.5 L of O2\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twill be required to react with 2.7 L of C3H8 .
Not all reactions involving gases take\r\n\t\t\t\t\tplace at STP or under constant conditions. In such cases, it may be necessary to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcombine stoichiometry techniques with gas laws. Let's take a look at some\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsuch problems.
What volume of hydrogen at 27 C and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t torr may be prepared by the reaction of 8.88 g of gallium with an excess\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof hydrochloric acid?
Note that in a similar problem above we\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tused the molar volume of a gas (22.4 L) to make this calculation. This will\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnot work here because the reaction does not occur at STP.
To convert from mass of gallium to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvolume of H2 (g) we will follow a similar process initially to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfind the mol of H2 (g) produced. Then apply the ideal gas\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequation to find the volume of H2 (g) at the given temperature\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand pressure. The steps of the process are seen below:
Convert from g Ga to mol H\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t using stoichiometry.
$$\\require{cancel} 8.88\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ Ga}} \\times \\frac{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ Ga}}}{69.72\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ Ga}}} \\times \\frac{3 \\mathrm{mol\\ H_2}}{2\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ Ga}}} = 0.191 \\mathrm{mol H_2}$$
Now apply the ideal gas law to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcalculate the volume of H 2 .
$$\\require{cancel} V_{\\mathrm{H_2}} =\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\\left(\\frac{nRt}{P}\\right)}_{H_2} = \\frac{0.191 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\times 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}} \\times 300 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}}}{0.951\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}} = 4.94 \\mathrm{L\\ H_2}$$

Consider the element gold,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfor example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\thalves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that\r\n\t\t\t\t\twas so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knife\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmay be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek atomos,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmeaning cindivisibled). This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided any\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfurther.
The smallest particle of an element that retains the properties\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof that element.
An atom is so small that its size is\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eye\r\n\t\t\t\t\tis a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcentimeter (0.0001 cm) in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand is\r\n\t\t\t\t\talmost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsingle carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To\r\n\t\t\t\t\tput this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would\r\n\t\t\t\t\trequire about 150 million carbon atom cdimesd to cover it.
The mass of an atom is also difficult to\r\n\t\t\t\t\timagine. A billion lead atoms (1,000,000,000 atoms) weigh about 3  10\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-13 grams, a mass that is far too light to be weighed on even the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tworlds most sensitive balances. It would require over 300,000,000,000,000 lead\r\n\t\t\t\t\tatoms (300 trillion, or 3  10 14 ) to be weighed, and they would\r\n\t\t\t\t\tweigh only 0.0000001 gram.
It is rare to find collections of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\targon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms. One form of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\telement sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmolecule\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo or more atoms joined together by chemical bonds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda\r\n\t\t\t\t\tin a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmolecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found\r\n\t\t\t\t\tin the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tunit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule\r\n\t\t\t\t\tis a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLike atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of\r\n\t\t\t\t\twater were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it\r\n\t\t\t\t\twould be about the size of golf balls.
Two or more atoms joined together by chemical bonds.
We can classify matter into several\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcategories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpure substance\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA substance that has a constant composition.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance have\r\n\t\t\t\t\texactly the same makeup and properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4% oxygen by mass. Any sample of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated.
A substance that has a constant composition.
We can divide pure substances into two\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclasses: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken down into\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsimpler substances by chemical changes are called \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\telements\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstances by chemical changes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiar\r\n\t\t\t\t\texamples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturally\r\n\t\t\t\t\ton the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories. All\r\n\t\t\t\t\telements are listed on the Periodic Table of Elements as seen below. It is\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlikely that you are familiar with many of these elements, but not all. We will\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdiscuss the Periodic Table in much more detail a little later in this\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcourse.
Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubstances by chemical changes.
Pure substances that can be broken down by\r\n\t\t\t\t\tchemical changes are called \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompounds\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPure substances that can be broken down into simpler substances\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby chemical changes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t. This breakdown may produce either elements or other compounds, or\r\n\t\t\t\t\tboth. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down by\r\n\t\t\t\t\theat into the elements mercury and oxygen as seen below. When heated in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tabsence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe compound water.
Pure substances that can be broken down into simpler substances\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby chemical changes.
The properties of combined elements are\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdifferent from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, white\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcrystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcombination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of its\r\n\t\t\t\t\tuncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorless\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsolid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to form\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.

A mixture with a composition that varies\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom point to point is called a \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\theterogeneous mixture\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA mixture with a composition that varies from point to point and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore has visibly different parts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture, as seen in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe image on left below. Its composition can vary because we can make it from\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvarying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpoint throughout the mixtureone drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a different\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdrop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\therbs settle to the bottom of the container. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgranite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).

An example of a solution is a sports drink,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes mixed together\r\n\t\t\t\t\tuniformly. Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each drop\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcomposition of a sports drink can varyit could be made with somewhat more or\r\n\t\t\t\t\tless sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Other\r\n\t\t\t\t\texamples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsolution of salt in water.
A mixture that has a uniform composition and appears visually the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsame throughout.
Although there are just over 100 elements,\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttens of millions of chemical compounds result from different combinations of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthese elements. Each compound has a specific composition and possesses definite\r\n\t\t\t\t\tchemical and physical properties by which we can distinguish it from all other\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcompounds. And, of course, there are innumerable ways to combine elements and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcompounds to form different mixtures.
Drag the terms from the bottom of the activity into their appropriate\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tposition in the flowchart below.
Eleven elements make up about 99% of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tearths crust and atmosphere. Oxygen constitutes nearly one-half and silicon\r\n\t\t\t\t\tabout one-quarter of the total quantity of these elements. A majority of\r\n\t\t\t\t\telements on earth are found in chemical combinations with other elements; about\r\n\t\t\t\t\tone-quarter of the elements are also found in the free state.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Covalent Radius,"The quantum mechanical picture makes it difficult\r\n\t\t\tto establish a definite size of an atom. However, there are several practical ways to\r\n\t\t\tdefine the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give\r\n\t\t\troughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius as seen in the figure below,\r\n\t\t\twhich is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when\r\n\t\t\tthey are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within\r\n\t\t\tmolecules still retain much of their atomic identity).
We know that as we scan down a group, the principal\r\n\t\t\tquantum number, n, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being\r\n\t\t\tadded to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently,\r\n\t\t\tthe size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance\r\n\t\t\tof the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent\r\n\t\t\tradii of the halogens below.
In the diagram below, you can see the trend\r\n\t\t\t\t\tin covalent atomic radius for the whole periodic table. Note that within a group\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe covalent atomic radius increases from top to bottom.
As you can see in the image above, as we\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmove across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has\r\n\t\t\t\t\ta smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcounterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsmaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnuclear charge, Zeff. This is the pull exerted on a specific\r\n\t\t\t\t\telectron by the nucleus, taking into account any electronelectron repulsions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tFor hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge (Z) and the\r\n\t\t\t\t\teffective nuclear charge (Zeff) are equal. For all other atoms, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnucleus, and thus:
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$$Z_{eff} = Z - \\mathrm{shielding}$$\r\n\t\t\t\t
Shielding is determined by the probability\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as\r\n\t\t\t\t\twell as by the electronelectron repulsions the electron of interest encounters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCore electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdo not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, Zeff\r\n\t\t\t\t\tincreases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, Z\r\n\t\t\t\t\tincreases as we move from left to right across a period. The\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tright side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcovalent radii smaller.
Since it is the core electrons that shield\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nucleus, we can use this number of core electrons to estimate Zeff\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfor an element. Note that these Zeff values from\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis calculations are approximations, but can be used for comparing Zeff\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof elements within the same period. For example a sodium atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\thas 11 protons and 11 electrons, 10 of which are core electrons that shield the\r\n\t\t\t\t valence electron from the attractive force of the 11 protons in the nucleus.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe can approximate Zeff as 11 - 10 = +1. Similarly a magnesium atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\thas 12 protons and 12 electrons, 10 of which are core electrons. Zeff\r\n\t\t\t\t\t= 12 - 10 = +2. This is illustrated in the image below.
The larger value of Zeff for\r\n\t\t\t\t\tMg indicates that there is a stronger attractive force that exists between the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnucleus and valence electrons in the Mg atom than exists between the nucleus and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvalence electron of the sodium atom. The result of this stronger attraction is\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat the Mg atom is slightly smaller than the Na atom even though it has more\r\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons.
The graph below further illustrates the\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttrend of atomic radii:

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Derived Quantities,"We can derive many quantities from the seven SI base quantities. For example, we can use the base\n            quantity of length to define volume, and the base quantities of mass and length to\n            define density.
\n                        Volume\n                        \n                            \n                                amount of space occupied by an object.\n                            \n                        \n                     is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The\n                    standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length. The standard\n                    volume is a cubic meter (m3), a cube with an edge length of exactly\n                    one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with\n                    edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or\n                    any other substance.
amount of space occupied by an object.
A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10\n                    cm). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one\n                    cubic decimeter (dm3). A liter (L) is the more common name for the\n                    cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.
A cubic centimeter (cm3) is the volume of a cube with an edge length\n                    of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often\n                    used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is also called a milliliter\n                    (mL) and is 1/1000 of a liter.
Volume is a very common unit of measure used in chemistry. Below are images of\n                    common glassware used to measure volume.
We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its \n                        density\n                        \n                            \n                                ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object\n                            \n                        \n                    . Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and\n                    length.
ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object
The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance\n                    to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter\n                        (kg/m3). For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient\n                    unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) or grams per milliliter (g/mL)\n                    for the\n                    densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. Although\n                    there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from\n                    about 0.7 g/cm3 (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm3 (the\n                    density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L. The table shows the\n                    densities of some common substances.
While there are many ways to determine the density of an object, perhaps the most\n                    straightforward method involves separately finding the mass and volume of the\n                    object, and then dividing the mass of the sample by its volume. In the following\n                    example, the mass is found directly by weighing, but the volume is found\n                    indirectly through length measurements.

Goldin bricks, bars, and coinshas been a form of currency for centuries.\n                        In order to swindle people into paying for a brick of gold without actually\n                        investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling the centers of\n                        hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire\n                        brick is gold. It does not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density\n                        is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm3. What is the density of lead if\n                        a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?
(We will discuss the reason for rounding to the first decimal place in the\n                        next section.)
What is the density of the rubber stopper seen in the image to the left if\n                        its mass is 10.32 g?
To determine the density of an irregularly shaped solid we can use the\n                        process of water displacement. The initial volume is recorded, in this\n                        example 30.0 mL. Then the object is carefully placed in the water and the\n                        new volume is recorded, in this example 35.6 mL. The difference between the\n                        initial volume and the final volume is the volume of the object.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Electrolytes,"Water is referred to as the universal solvent because it can dissolve many different\n            types of substances. However, not all substances dissolve in water in the same way.\n            Let\'s look at ordinary table salt, NaCl, and table sugar,\n                C12H22O11 (sucrose), dissolved in water. You know\n            from everyday experience that both of these substances are soluble in water, but on a\n            molecular level the way in which they dissolve is quite different and results in\n            solutions with different properties.
When NaCl dissolves in water, the sodium ions and the chloride ions break away from the\n            solid and each individual ion is surrounded by water molecules. This breaking apart of\n            the ions is referred to as \n                dissociation\n                \n                    \n                        physical process accompanying the dissolution of an ionic compound in\n                            which the compounds constituent ions are solvated and dispersed\n                            throughout the solution\n                    \n                \n            . NaCl is a substance that completely, or nearly completely dissociates in\n            water. Nearly 100% of the ions separate into the solution.
physical process accompanying the dissolution of an ionic compound in\n                            which the compounds constituent ions are solvated and dispersed\n                            throughout the solution
One important property of the resulting solution is its ability to conduct electricity.\n            Conductivity of a solution can be tested with an apparatus such as the one seen below.\n            Solutions that contain charged particles (ions) allow the electric current to flow\n            between the anodes. This will complete the circuit and cause the light bulb to light up.\n            Substances, like NaCl, that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called \n                electrolytes\n                \n                    \n                        substances that produces ions when dissolved in water\n                    \n                \n            . More specifically NaCl is a \n                strong electrolyte\n                \n                    \n                        substance that dissociates or ionizes completely when dissolved in\n                            water\n                    \n                \n             because it conducts electricity very well.

As seen in the animation above when salt is dissolved in water, the resulting solution\n            conducts electricity.
Animation developed from PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado Boulder,\n                https://phet.colorado.edu.
The reason the solution conducts electricity is that the ions in the NaCl completely\n            dissociate in water breaking apart into Na+ and Cl- ions, as seen\n            in the animation above.
When sugar dissolves in water, it does something quite different on the molecular level\n            than salt. The individual sugar molecules do not dissociate. Because there are no\n            charged particles (ions) in the solution, the sugar solution does not conduct\n            electricity.

When sugar is dissolved in water it does not conduct electricity as seen in the animation\n            above.
Animation developed from PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado Boulder,\n                https://phet.colorado.edu.
The reason the sugar water does not conduct electricity is because the sugar does not\n            dissociate in water to form ions. Notice in the animation above that the sugar molecule\n            remains intact when dissolved in water. Substances, such as sugar, that when dissolved\n            in water do not conduct electricity are referred to as \n                nonelectrolytes\n                \n                    \n                        substances that does not produce ions when dissolved in water\n                    \n                \n            .
substances that does not produce ions when dissolved in water
Other substances when dissolved in water only dissociate to a small extent. Acetic acid,\n            vinegar, is an example of one such substance. When acetic acid is in water it\n            dissociates only slightly (about 1%). There are some charged particles in the solution,\n            but relatively few. Because of this, an acetic acid solution will conduct electricity,\n            but only to a small extent. Substances that conduct electricity to a small extent are\n            referred to as \n                weak electrolytes\n                \n                    \n                        substances that ionizes only partially when dissolved in water\n                    \n                \n            . \n            Whereas NaCl, as discussed previously, that completely dissociates and conducts electricity to a large extent is a strong electrolyte.\n
substances that ionizes only partially when dissolved in water
Under most conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,\n            and are classified as strong electrolytes. Most molecular compounds, with the exception\n            of acids, do not dissociate when dissolved in water and are nonelectrolytes.
While acids and bases will be discussed in more detail later, it is important to note\n            here that strong acids are strong electrolytes because they completely dissociate into\n                H+ and their constituent anion. For instance, the strong acid nitric\n            acid, HNO3, dissociates into H+ and NO3-\n            ions. Likewise, the strong acid perchloric acid dissociates into H+ and\n                ClO4-.
Weak acids and bases, on the other hand, are weak electrolytes. Weak acids only\n            dissociate slightly. As we saw above with the weak acid, acetic acid. While it does\n            produce H+ and C2H3O2- ions, it\n            only does so to a small extent.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Electronic Structure of Ions,"When forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its\n                    valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that\n                    precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the\n                    alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence\n                    shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from\n                    atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For\n                    example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and\n                    a ground state electron configuration of\n                    1s22s22p63s23p64s2.\n                    When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with\n                    18 electrons, a 2+ charge, and an electron configuration of\n                    1s22s22p63s23p6. The\n                    Ca2+ ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar.\n                    Likewise, the potassium ion, K+, has 18 electrons and is\n                    isoelectronicgroup of ions or atoms that have identical electron configurations with the noble gas Ar.
group of ions or atoms that have identical electron configurations
For metals in groups 12, the group numbers exceed the number of valence\n                    electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full d subshells in atoms of\n                    elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed\n                    by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10. For\n                    example, aluminum (in group 13) forms 3+ ions (Al3+).
Exceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the\n                    groups. In addition to the expected ions Tl3+, Sn4+,\n                    Pb4+, and Bi5+, a partial loss of these atoms valence\n                    shell electrons can also lead to the formation of Tl+,\n                    Sn2+, Pb2+, and Bi3+ ions. The formation of\n                    these 1+, 2+, and 3+ cations is ascribed to the inert pair effect, which\n                    reflects the relatively low energy of the valence s-electron pair for atoms of\n                    the heavy elements of groups 13, 14, and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an\n                    unexpected behavior: it forms a diatomic ion, Hg22+ (an\n                    ion formed from two mercury atoms, with an Hg-Hg bond), in addition to the\n                    expected monatomic ion Hg2+ (formed from only one mercury atom).
Transition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main\n                    group elements. Most transition metal cations have 2+ or 3+ charges that result\n                    from the loss of their outermost s electron(s) first, sometimes followed by the\n                    loss of one or two d electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example,\n                    iron\n                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2)\n                    forms the ion Fe2+\n                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d6)\n                    by the loss of the 4s electron and the ion Fe3+\n                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d5)\n                    by the loss of the 4s electron and one of the 3d electrons. Although the d\n                    orbitals of the transition elements areaccording to the Aufbau principlethe\n                    last to fill when building up electron configurations, the outermost s electrons\n                    are the first to be lost when these atoms ionize.
There are at least 14 elements categorized as cessential trace elementsd for\n                        the human body. They are called cessentiald because they are required for\n                        healthy bodily functions, ctraced because they are required only in small\n                        amounts, and celementsd in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two\n                        of these essential trace elements, chromium and zinc, are required as Cr3+\n                        and Zn2+. Write the electron configurations of these cations.
First, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms:
Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition\n                        metals, electrons are removed from the s orbital first and then from the d\n                        orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p orbitals\n                        and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have\n                        a charge of 2+, and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital.\n                        Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons and then\n                        its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron\n                        configurations of the ions:
Most monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to\n                    completely fill its outer s and p orbitals, thereby reaching the electron\n                    configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to determine the charge\n                    on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must\n                    be gained to fill the s and p orbitals of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example,\n                    has the electron configuration 1s22s22p4,\n                    whereas the oxygen anion has the electron configuration of the noble gas neon\n                    (Ne), 1s22s22p6. The two additional electrons\n                    required to fill the valence orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2\n                    (O2).
Selenium and iodine are two essential trace elements that form anions. Write\n                        the electron configurations of the anions.

One scheme classifies energy into two\n            types: (i)\n                potential energy\n                \n                    \n                        energy of a particle or system of particles derived from relative\n                            position, composition, or condition\n                    \n                \n            , the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or\n            condition, and (ii)\n                kinetic energy\n                \n                    \n                        energy of a moving body, in joules, equal to 1/2 mv2 (where\n                                m = mass and v =\n                            velocity)\n                    \n                \n            , the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of\n            a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward\n            through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce\n            electricity in a hydroelectric plant. A battery has potential energy because the\n            chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.
energy of a particle or system of particles derived from relative\n                            position, composition, or condition
energy of a moving body, in joules, equal to 1/2 mv2 (where\n                                m = mass and v =\n                            velocity)
Kinetic energy is dependent on an object\'s mass and velocity according to the\n                    following equation:
Where m is mass in kg and v is\n                    velocity in m/s. If mass,  m is in kg and velocity, v, is in m/s, then the kinetic energy has units of\n                    Joules (J = kg m2/s2).
Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before\n            a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This\n            observation is expressed in the \n                law of conservation of energy\n                \n                    \n                        during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor\n                            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.\n                    \n                \n            : during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor\n            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.
during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor\n                            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.
PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu/\n
In the simulation above, follow the directions and answer the questions that\n                follow.
Return to the simulation.
Check to see if your calculations match the approximate values given for PE and KE in\n                the bar graph of the simulation.
As you are likely aware the assumption in the previous exercise, that no energy was lost\n            to friction, is not what occurs in the real world. As well as having kinetic and\n            potential energy, energy is being transferred from the skateboard to the surface of the\n            track in the form of thermal energy caused by the interaction between the wheels of the\n            skateboard and the surface of the track. Return to the skatepark simulation and choose\n            the ""Friction"" screen. Again click to show the bar graph. Drag the skater to the top of\n            the track and observe the changes in energy now that the thermal energy due to friction\n            is accounted for.
When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of\n            one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the\n            conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example,\n            chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose\n            gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a cars engine, the rapidly\n            expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type\n            of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders pistons.
For chemical reactions, mass and energy are conserved separately. The total mass present\n            before the reaction occurs is equal to the total mass present after the reaction occurs.\n            Likewise, the total energy present before the reaction occurs is equal to the total\n            energy present after the reaction occurs. However, for nuclear reactions, mass can be\n            converted into energy according to Einsteins formula (E = mc2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light). In nuclear reactions, the total mass\n            changes and this leads to changes in energy that are much larger (by factors of a\n            million or so) than chemical reactions. To encompass both chemical and nuclear changes,\n            we combine these laws into one statement: The total quantity of matter and energy in the\n            universe is fixed. For most of this course, we will considering only chemical reactions,\n            and so energy and mass are separately conserved.
The animations and activities that follow show how energy is transformed from one type to\n            another in certain processes. In considering systems such as these, kinetic energy is\n            often referred to as mechanical energy.",
Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Enthalpy of Combustion,"Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the\n                    reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a\n                    commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the\n                    determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the\n                    IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions\n                    at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list\n                    values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the \xceH of\n                    a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure (1 bar =\n                    0.987 atm), \xceH values (except for the most precisely\n                    measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard\n                    conditions. We will include a superscripted cod in the enthalpy change symbol to\n                    designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard)\n                    temperature is 298.15 K, we will use a subscripted d to designate this\n                    temperature. Thus, the symbol \n                        \n                            Δ\n                            \n                                H\n                                298\n                                o\n                            \n                        \n                     is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under\n                    these conditions. (The symbol \xceH is used to indicate an\n                    enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)
The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are\n                    available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions,\n                    phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it\n                    is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy\n                    changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the\n                    amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the\n                    \xceH for specific amounts of reactants). However, we\n                    often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (\xceH) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive\n                    value of \xceH, often cnormalizedd to a per-mole basis.\n                    (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat\n                    from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)
Standard enthalpy of combustion (\n                \n                    Δ\n                    \n                        H\n                        C\n                        o\n                    \n                \n             ) is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously\n            with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called cheat of\n            combustion.d For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, .8 kJ/mol, is the\n            amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at 25 C\n            and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at 25 C and 1 atm.
Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are\n            listed in the table below. Many readily available substances with large enthalpies of\n            combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as coal or charcoal), and\n            hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane,\n            and the major components of gasoline.
As seen in the image below, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic\n                process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L\n                of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of\n                isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692\n                g/mL.
Starting with a known amount (1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions\n                between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy\n                of combustion of isooctane provides one of the necessary conversions. The table\n                above gives this value as  kJ per 1 mole of isooctane\n                    (C8H18).
The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This is alot of\n                energy; it is enough to melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)",
Solutions,Solubility,The Formation of Solutions,"The formation of a solution is an example of a spontaneous process, a process that occurs\n            under specified conditions without the requirement of energy from some external source.\n            Sometimes we stir a mixture to speed up the dissolution process, but this is not\n            necessary; a homogeneous solution would form if we waited long enough. The topic of\n            spontaneity is critically important to the study of chemical thermodynamics and is\n            treated more thoroughly in a later unit. For purposes of this moduless discussion, it\n            will suffice to consider two criteria that favor, but do not guarantee, the spontaneous\n            formation of a solution:
In the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as\n            heat is absorbed or evolved. An increase in disorder always results when a solution\n            forms.
When the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent\n            species in a solution are no different than those present in the separated components,\n            the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change. Such a solution is called an\n            ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which\n            closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities\n            comprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.
When containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to\n            diffusion and form a solution. The formation of this solution clearly involves an\n            increase in disorder, since the helium and argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as\n            that which each occupied before mixing.
This example illustrates how diffusion alone can provide the driving force required to\n            cause the spontaneous formation of a solution.
Three types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process:\n                  solute-solute, solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in the diagram below,\n                  the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process in which energy is\n                  consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic\n                  processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic\n                  process referred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes\n                  associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process\n                  overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the\n                  energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater than the\n                  energy released by solvation.
For example, cooking oils and water will not mix to any appreciable extent to yield\n                  solutions. Hydrogen bonding is the dominant intermolecular attractive force present in\n                  liquid water; the nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules of cooking oils are not capable of\n                  hydrogen bonding, instead being held together by dispersion forces. Forming an oil-water\n                  solution would require overcoming the very strong hydrogen bonding in water, as well as\n                  the significantly strong dispersion forces between the relatively large oil molecules.\n                  And, since the polar water molecules and nonpolar oil molecules would not experience\n                  very strong intermolecular attraction, very little energy would be released by\n                  solvation.
On the other hand, a mixture of ethanol and water will mix in any proportions to yield a\n                  solution. In this case, both substances are capable of hydrogen bonding, and so the\n                  solvation process is sufficiently exothermic to compensate for the endothermic\n                  separations of solute and solvent molecules.
As noted, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by exothermic\n                  dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the\n                  release of heat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate\n                  (NH4NO3) is one such example and is used to make instant cold\n                  packs for treating injuries. A thin-walled plastic bag\n                  of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid NH4NO3. When the\n                  smaller bag is broken, a solution of NH4NO3 forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings\n                  (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that\n                  decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy\n                  input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated,\n                  but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies\n                  formation of the solution.

Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Heating and Cooling Curves,"In the unit on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or\n            released by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature\n            change, \xceT, was introduced:
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,\n            but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a\n            temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat\n            is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of\n            increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a\n            change in state, its temperature remains constant.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply\n            heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the waters\n            temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant\n            despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is\n            maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to\n            provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the\n            boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase\n            transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state\n            is in progress.
The slide show below shows the change in temperature that occurs when a constant source\n            of heat is added to ice with an initial temperature of -10.0 oC. The resulting graph is\n            known as a heating curve.
How much heat is required to convert 135 g of ice at  C into water vapor at 120\n                C?
The transition described involves the following steps:
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in\n                phase) is: q = m  c  \xceT (see previous chapter on\n                thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given by q = n  \xceH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water,\n                and steam, and enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, we have:
Converting the quantities in J to kJ permits them to be summed, yielding the total\n                heat required:
The values below for water are used in the following example:
Calculate the heat required to convert 25.0 g solid ethanol at -135.0 oC\n                to liquid at 72.0 oC. Specific heat of solid ethanol = 0.97 J/g\n                    oC. Specific heat liquid ethanol 2.3 J/ g oC.
\xceHfus of ethanol = 4.9 kJ/mol
\xceHvap of ethanol = 38.56 kJ/mol

Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Heat Capacity and Specific Heat,"Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorieunit of heat or other energy; the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius; 1 cal is defined as 4.184 J is the amount of\n            energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this\n            quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water.\n            The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is\n            still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used\n            in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and\n            energy is the jouleSI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of\n            1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James\n            Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is\n            also called 1 newtonmeter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its\n            definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

SI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal
We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change: heat\n            capacity and specific heat capacity.
The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of\n                            heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change\n                            (\xceT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):
Heat capacityextensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs\n                    or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive propertyits value is\n                    proportional to the amount of the substance.
extensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans.
The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small\n                    pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large\n                    pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more\n                    atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of\n                    those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan\n                    is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature\n                    of the pan by 50.0 C:
The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires\n                    90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 C. The larger pan has a\n                    (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material\n                    requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same\n                    temperature change:
The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its cspecific\n                            heat,d is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram\n                            of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):
Specific heat capacityintensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or\n                    releasing heat. It is an intensive propertythe type, but not the amount, of the\n                    substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a\n                    mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is\n                    therefore:
intensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can\n                    also calculate the specific heat of iron:
Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of\n                    the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the\n                    material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of\n                    energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from\n                    a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity,\n                    also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular\n                    substance and has units of J/mol C.",
Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,Introduction to Chemistry,"Chemistry is sometimes referred to as cthe central scienced due to its\n                    interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for\n                    areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).\n                    Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine,\n                    materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields.\n                  The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many\n                    aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines\n                    within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry.\n                    Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools\n                    that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the\n                    chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial\n                    to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living\n                    organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and\n                    nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce\n                    useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture,\n                    food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide\n                    sustenance in the form of food and drink to the worlds population. Medicine,\n                    pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that\n                    help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and\n                    atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand\n                    and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the\n                    universe in astronomy and cosmology.
What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and\n                    assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing,\n                    containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and\n                    other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you\n                    will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and\n                    structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their\n                    causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws\n                    involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the\n                    study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice\n                    of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens\n                    whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead\n                    to such changes.
Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and their changes. Chemists study and\n                    describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains:\n                    macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of\n                    considering and describing chemical behavior.
Macro is a Greek word that means clarge.d The macroscopic domain is familiar to\n                    us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed\n                    directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat\n                    and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday\n                    and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical\n                    properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability.
The microscopic domain of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination.\n                    Micro also comes from Greek and means csmall.d Some aspects of the microscopic\n                    domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite\n                    or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye,\n                    but when were suffering from a cold, were reminded of how real they are.
However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistrysuch as\n                    atoms and moleculesare too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and\n                    often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain\n                    include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of\n                    which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms\n                    in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual\n                    molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules\n                    into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms\n                    together are created.
The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent\n                    components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as\n                    those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are\n                    part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider\n                    calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important\n                    role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic\n                    domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the\n                    challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols\n                    can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and\n                    one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that\n                    must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.
A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous\n                    substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze\n                    to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher\n                    temperatures are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall\n                    into the microscopic domainwhat we cannot observe with the naked eye. The\n                    description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and\n                    the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these\n                    molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe\n                    water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the\n                    symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for gas, (s) for solid, and (l) for\n                    liquid are also symbolic.

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Attractive Forces of Ionic Compounds,"Ionic substances are those in which the constituent atoms are joined with ionic\n                    bonds. Ionic bonds differ from covalent bonds in that ionic bonds involve one or\n                    more electrons being transferred from one atom to another rather than being\n                    shared between the two atoms. This type of bonding is observed between pairs of\n                    atoms that have a large electronegativity difference, like the alkali metals in\n                    the first column of the periodic table and the halogens, in group 17. The low\n                    electronegativity atom gives one or more electrons to the high electronegativity\n                    atom. This results in a positively charged cation and a negatively charged\n                    anion. In the image below we can see that atoms electronegativity increases\n                    from a minimum at the bottom left of the periodic table to a maximum at the top\n                    right (excluding the noble gases).
Because of the large differences in electronegativity, the force of attraction\n                    that holds an ionic compound together, the ionic bond, is very strong. The\n                    strength of attraction between the charged ions that make up an ionic compound\n                    are governed by Coulombs law.
in which F is the attractive force between two\n                            charged particles, k is a constant that depends\n                            on the type of crystal structure; q1\n                            and q2 are the charges on the ions;\n                            and r2 is the interionic distance\n                            (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions).
Note that the equation we looked at earlier to determine relative lattice\n                            energies is a variation of this same formula.
Lattice energy is directly related to the strength of attractive forces.\n                    Substances with larger lattice energy have stronger attractive forces.\n                    Therefore, in comparing the differences in boiling points of ionic substances,\n                    those with higher lattice energy will have higher boiling points.
Inter-ion force increases as ions get smaller because the negatively-charged\n                    electrons of one ion are closer to the positively-charged nucleus of the other\n                    ion. As radii of ions decrease the attractive forces increase and therefore\n                    boiling points increase. We can see this in the table below, which compares the\n                    boiling points of RbI, RbBr, and RbCl.
Coulomb\'s law, which measures the strength of attractive forces between charged\n                    particles also incorporates the magnitude of charge of each of the charged\n                    particles. As the magnitude of charges of the ions within an ionic compounds\n                    increase, the lattice energy increases and likewise the attractive force between\n                    the ions and the boiling point of the compound will increase. For example, NaF\n                    and CaO have distances between their nuclei of 1.18  and 1.20  , respectively.\n                    With a very small difference in the sizes, we might expect their boiling points\n                    to be likewise close in value. However, the boiling point of CaO is\n                    significantly larger at 2850 oC compared to that of NaF at 1695\n                        oC. This is due to the charges of the ions; CaO with charges of\n                    +2 and -2, while NaF has charges of +1 and -1. It is also important to note that\n                    the magnitude of charge generally has a more significant impact on boiling point\n                    compared to the size of ions. The illustration below shows atomic and ionic\n                    radii of select elements.

Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions,"Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated\n                    that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same\n                    proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions(also, law of constant composition) all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass\n                    or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of\n                    the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent\n                    with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a\n                    component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system)\n                    are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1,\n                    as shown in table below.
(also, law of constant composition) all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass
It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the\n                    same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have\n                    the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there\n                    are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass\n                    ratio of 5.33:1.00.
Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments,\n                    to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportionswhen two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers states\n                    that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one\n                    element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\n                    numbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid\n                    with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown\n                    crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These\n                    ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative;\n                    however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly\n                    surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.
when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers
$$\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{1.116\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{Cl}}{1\\;\\mathrm\n                        g\\;\\mathrm{Cu}}}{\\displaystyle\\frac{0.558\\;\\mathrm\n                        g\\;\\mathrm{Cl}}{1\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{Cu}}}\\;=\\;\$$
This 2-to-1 ratio means that the brown compound has twice the amount of chlorine\n                    per amount of copper as the green compound.
This can be explained by atomic theory if the copper-to-chlorine ratio in the\n                    brown compound is 1 copper atom to 2 chlorine atoms, and the ratio in the green\n                    compound is 1 copper atom to 1 chlorine atom. The ratio of chlorine atoms (and\n                    thus the ratio of their masses) is therefore 2 to 1.
A sample of compound X (a clear, colorless, combustible liquid with a\n                        noticeable odor) is analyzed and found to contain 14.13 g carbon and 2.96 g\n                        hydrogen. A sample of compound Y (a clear, colorless, combustible liquid\n                        with a noticeable odor that is slightly different from Xs odor) is analyzed\n                        and found to contain 19.91 g carbon and 3.34 g hydrogen. Are these data an\n                        example of the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple proportions,\n                        or neither? What do these data tell you about substances X and Y?
In compound X, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
In compound Y, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
The ratio of these ratios is:
This small, whole-number ratio supports the law of multiple proportions. This means that X and Y are different compounds.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Lewis Structures,"We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in\n            Lewis structures, drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions.\n            For example, when two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of\n            electrons:
The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not\n            used in bonding (called \n                lone pairs\n                \n                    \n                        two (a pair of) valence electrons that are not used to form a covalent\n                            bond\n                    \n                \n            ) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line)\n            is sometimes used to indicate a shared pair of electrons:
two (a pair of) valence electrons that are not used to form a covalent\n                            bond
A single shared pair of electrons is called a \n                single bond\n                \n                    \n                        bond in which a single pair of electrons is shared between two atoms\n                    \n                \n            . Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six in the lone pairs\n            and the two in the single bond.
bond in which a single pair of electrons is shared between two atoms
The other halogen molecules (F2, Br2, I2, and\n                        At2) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single\n                    bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each\n                    halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main\n                    group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons (or 2 valence\n                    electrons in the 1st shell) is known as the octet rule, as discussed\n                    previously.
The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number\n                    of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is\n                    especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C,\n                    N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in\n                    its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an\n                    octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as\n                    illustrated here for carbon in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH4\n                    (silane). Hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, which is\n                    the first shell. It has one valence electron so it forms one covalent bond to\n                    obtain the noble gas configuration of helium.
Group 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic\n                    Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet,\n                    these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in NH3 (ammonia). Oxygen\n                    and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds.\n                    Fluorine and other atoms in group 17 obtain an octet by forming one covalent\n                    bond.
As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we\n                    call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than\n                    one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A \n                        double bond\n                        \n                            \n                                bond in which two pairs of electrons is shared between two\n                                    atoms\n                            \n                        \n                     forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms,\n                    as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in CH2O (formaldehyde) and\n                    between the two carbon atoms in C2H4 (ethylene):

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Lone Pairs of Electrons and Bond Angles,"Small distortions from the ideal angles can result from differences in repulsion between\n            various regions of electron density. In the following activity you will observe the\n            differences in bond angles between molecules that have the same electron-pair geometry,\n            but different numbers of lone pairs of electrons and therefore different molecular\n            shapes.
If you would like to open the simulation in a separate tab, click this\n                    link:Molecular\n                    Shapes\n
Open the simulation and choose ""Real Molecules."" In the ""Name"" section check\n                ""Molecule Geometry"" and ""Electron Geometry."" In the ""Options"" section check ""Show\n                Bond Angles."" Choose each of the molecules in the table below and fill in the\n                appropriate information. Note you may have to move the molecules around a bit to see\n                the bond angles clearly. Observe the molecules with and without viewing the lone\n                pairs of electrons by checking and unchecking ""Show Lone Pairs"" in the ""Options""\n                section.\n            \n
As seen in the activity above in the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached\n            to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal planar molecular structure,\n            but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramidal with the nitrogen atom at the apex\n            and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal\n            pyramidal shape are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are\n            slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than\n            do bonding electrons. The HNH bond angles in NH3 are slightly smaller than the 109.5\n            angle in a regular tetrahedral shape such as that of CH4 because the lone pair-bonding\n            pair repulsion is greater than the bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion.
Small distortions from the ideal angles result from differences in repulsion between\n            various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by\n            establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by\n            different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest\n            to least repulsion is:
lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair
This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of\n            electrons. A lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons\n            in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy more space than those in a\n            double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is:
lone pair > triple bond > double bond > single bond
Consider formaldehyde, H2CO, which is used as a preservative for biological\n            and anatomical specimens (Figure). This molecule has regions of high electron density\n            that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal\n            planar with 120 bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger\n            angles (121), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118).
The table below summarizes the content you explored previously. It is included here for\n            reference and convenience.
According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in the table above) are\n            equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries\n            (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone\n            pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal\n            electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in\n            diagram below: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two\n            axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial\n            position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). The axial\n            position is surrounded by bond angles of 90, whereas the equatorial position has more\n            space available because of the 120 bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair\n            geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious\n            positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs. Theoretically, we can come\n            up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF3\n            molecule. The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial\n            locations, giving a T-shaped molecular structure.
When a central atom has two lone electron pairs and four bonding regions, we have an\n            octahedral electron-pair geometry. The two lone pairs are on opposite sides of the\n            octahedron (180 apart), giving a square planar molecular structure that minimizes lone\n            pair-lone pair repulsions.

Gases,Gas Laws,Measuring Gas Pressure,"We can measure atmospheric pressure, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tforce exerted by the atmosphere on the earths surface, with a barometer. A\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbarometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile\r\n\t\t\t\t\tliquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that\r\n\t\t\t\t\tliquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcolumn of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsurface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.
If the liquid is water, normal atmospheric\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is rather\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury (Hg) is about\r\n\t\t\t\t.6-times denser than water, a mercury barometer only needs to be \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.6\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t as tall as a water barometera more suitable size. Standard\r\n\t\t\t\t\tatmospheric pressure of 1 atm at sea level (101,325 Pa) corresponds to a column\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high.
A manometer is a device similar to a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbarometer that can be used to measure the pressure of a gas trapped in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontainer. An open-end manometer is a U-shaped tube with one arm open to the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tatmosphere, one arm that connects to the gas to be measured, and a nonvolatile\r\n\t\t\t\t\tliquid (usually mercury) in between. The distance between the liquid levels\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponds to the difference in pressure between the gas in the container and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe atmosphere.
Calculate the pressure of the gas in the manometer pictured below in units of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkPa. Atmospheric pressure is determined to be 100.5 kPa.
In order to use the equation Pgas = Patm  h, the height and the atmospheric\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpressure need to be in the same units. Since we want our final answer in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tunits of kPa, we will convert 53 mmHg to kPa and then use the equation.
Now we can apply the equation:
*Note: Don\'t forget your significant figure rules for adding and subtracting.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn this example, we rounded our answer to the tenths place because that is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe last place value where both of our measurements have a significant\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfigure.",
Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Molecular Velocities and Kinetic Energy,"The previous discussion showed that the KMT\r\n\t\t\tqualitatively explains the behaviors described by the various gas laws. The postulates\r\n\t\t\tof this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual\r\n\t\t\tlaws. To do this, we must first look at velocities and kinetic energies of gas\r\n\t\t\tmolecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.
In a gas sample, individual molecules have widely\r\n\t\t\tvarying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisions\r\n\t\t\tinvolved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This\r\n\t\t\tmolecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it\r\n\t\t\tdepicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a given\r\n\t\t\tspeed.
The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at\r\n\t\t K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds. The\r\n\t\t\tnumber of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a maximum, which is\r\n\t\t\tthe most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, \xce\xbdp,\r\n\t\t\t is a little less than 400 m/s, while the root mean square speed, urms,\r\n\t\t\t\tis closer to 500 m/s.
The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass (m)\r\n\t\t\tand speed (u) is given by:
\r\n\t\t\t$$\\mathrm{KE} = \ mu^2$$\r\n\t\t
Expressing mass in kilograms and speed in meters\r\n\t\t\tper second will yield energy values in units of joules (J = kg m 2 s-2).\r\n\t\t\t\t To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages for\r\n\t\t\tboth speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT, the root mean square velocity of a particle,\r\n\t\t\turms , is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of the\r\n\t\t\tvelocities with n = the number of particles:
\r\n\t\t\t$$u_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{\\overline{u^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{u^2_1 + u^2_2 + u^2_3 +\r\n\t\t\t\tu^2_4 + ...}{n}}$$\r\n\t\t
The average kinetic energy, KE avg , is\r\n\t\t\tthen equal to:
\r\n\t\t\t$$\\mathrm{KE}_\\mathrm{avg} = \ mu^2_\\mathrm{rms}$$\r\n\t\t
Where m is the mass of an individual molecule of\r\n\t\t\tgas in kg. Assuming we are dealing with one mole of molecules of a gas we can derive the\r\n\t\t\tfollowing equation:
\r\n\t\t\t$$u_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\ RT}{M}}$$\r\n\t\t
Where M is the molar mass of the gas in units of\r\n\t\t\tkg/mol.
The KEavg of a collection of gas\r\n\t\t\tmolecules is also directly proportional to the temperature of the gas and may be\r\n\t\t\tdescribed by the equation:
\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t$$\\mathrm{KE}_\\mathrm{avg} = \ RT$$\r\n\t\t
where R is the gas constant and T is the kelvin\r\n\t\t\ttemperature. (*Note that in this equation only temperature affects average kinetic\r\n\t\t\tenergy. Any gas at the same temperature will have the same average kinetic energy.) When\r\n\t\t\tused in this equation, the appropriate form of the gas constant is 8.314 J/K mol (8.314\r\n\t\t\tkg m2 s-2 K-1 mol-1 ). These two\r\n\t\t\tseparate equations for KE avg may be combined and rearranged to yield a\r\n\t\t\trelation between molecular speed and temperature:
\r\n\t\t\t$$\ mu^2_\\mathrm{rms} = \ RT$$\r\n\t\t
\r\n\t\t\t$$u_{rms}\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}M}$$\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t
If the temperature of a gas increases, its KEavg\r\n\t\t\t\t increases, more molecules have higher speeds and fewer molecules have\r\n\t\t\tlower speeds, and the distribution shifts toward higher speeds overall, that is, to the\r\n\t\t\tright. If temperature decreases, KEavg decreases, more molecules have lower\r\n\t\t\tspeeds and fewer molecules have higher speeds, and the distribution shifts toward lower\r\n\t\t\tspeeds overall, that is, to the left. This behavior is illustrated for nitrogen gas\r\n\t\t\tbelow.
At a given temperature, all gases have the same KEavg\r\n\t\t\t\t for their molecules. Gases composed of lighter molecules have more\r\n\t\t\thigh-speed particles and a higher urms , with a speed distribution that\r\n\t\t\tpeaks at relatively higher velocities. Gases consisting of heavier molecules have more\r\n\t\t\tlow-speed particles, a lower urms , and a speed distribution that peaks at\r\n\t\t\trelatively lower velocities.

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Mole Fraction and Molality,"Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were\n            introduced earlier, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications.\n            For example, molarity (M) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations,\n            since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species:
Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary.\n            When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of\n            solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the\n            contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many\n            colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent\n            on temperature. Two such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous unit on\n            gases) and molality.
The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the\n                    total number of moles of all solution components:
Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of\n                    solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms:
Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with\n            temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring\n            temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as\n            will be described in this module.
The antifreeze in most automobile radiators is a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene\n                glycol and water, with minor amounts of other additives that prevent corrosion. What\n                are the (a) mole fraction and (b) molality of ethylene glycol,\n                    C2H4(OH)2, in a solution prepared from 2.22 \n                    103 g of ethylene glycol and 2.00  103 g of water\n                (approximately 2 L of glycol and 2 L of water)?
(a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar\n                amounts of both solution components and then substituting these amounts into the\n                unit definition.
Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties\n                with identical units (moles).
(b) To find molality, we need to know the moles of the solute and the mass of the\n                solvent (in kg).
First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of\n                solute:
Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms:
Finally, calculate molarity per its definition:
Calculate the mole fraction of solute and solvent in a 2.80 m solution of sodium\n                chloride.
Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing\n                the two unit definitions. In this case, both units have the same numerator (moles of\n                solute) but different denominators. The provided molal concentration may be written\n                as:
The numerator for this solutions mole fraction is, therefore, 2.80 mol NaCl. The\n                denominator may be computed by deriving the molar amount of water corresponding to\n                1.00 kg
and then substituting these molar amounts into the definition for mole fraction.
Note that the sum of the mole fraction of NaCl and the mole fraction of H2O is 1 (0.952 + 0.0480 = 1.000). This is true in general - the sum of the mole fractions of the solution components always equals 1.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Quantum Mechanics,"Werner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure\n                    properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that\n                    there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particles\n                    position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the\n                    momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at\n                    that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg\n                    uncertainty principle.
It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the\n                    momentum and the position of a particle.
For a particle of mass m moving with velocity vx in the x direction (or equivalently with momentum px), the product of the uncertainty in the\n                    position, \xcex, and the uncertainty in the momentum, \xcepx, must be\n                    greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{\\mathitf}{\}\\) (recall that\n                    \\(\\mathitf=\\;\\frac h{2\\pi}\\), the value of Plancks constant divided by 2\xcf).
$$\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_x = (\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq\n                    \\frac{\\hbar}2$$
This equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both\n                    the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we\n                    improve our measurement of an electrons position so that the uncertainty in the\n                    position (\xcex) has a value of, say, 1 pm\n                    (10-12 m, about 1% of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our\n                    determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at\n                    least
$$\\left[ \\Delta p = m \\Delta v = \\frac{h}{2 \\Delta x} \\right] =\n                    \\frac{(1.055 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{kg}\\\n                    \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s})}{(2\\^{-12}\\mathrm{m})} = 5 \\times\n                    10^{-23} \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$
The value of h is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a\n                    macroscopic object like a baseball is too insignificant to observe. However, the\n                    mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the\n                    uncertainty can be large and significant.
Heisenbergs principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.\n                    The uncertainty principle can be shown to be a consequence of waveparticle\n                    duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory\n                    from classical mechanics. Recall that the equations of motion obtained from\n                    classical mechanics are trajectories where, at any given instant in time, both\n                    the position and the momentum of a particle can be determined exactly.\n                    Heisenbergs uncertainty principle implies that such a view is untenable in the\n                    microscopic domain and that there are fundamental limitations governing the\n                    motion of quantum particles. This does not mean that microscopic particles do\n                    not move in trajectories, it is just that measurements of trajectories are\n                    limited in their precision.

Shortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom\n                    could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a\n                    particle moving in quantized circular orbits, as Bohr had argued, Erwin\n                    Schrdinger extended de Broglies work by incorporating the de Broglie relation\n                    into a wave equation, deriving what is today known as the Schrdinger equation.\n                    When Schrdinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to\n                    reproduce Bohrs expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula\n                    governing hydrogen spectra, and he did so without having to invoke Bohrs\n                    assumptions of stationary states and quantized orbits, angular momenta, and\n                    energies; quantization in Schrdingers theory was a natural consequence of the\n                    underlying mathematics of the wave equation.
Like de Broglie, Schrdinger initially viewed the electron in hydrogen as being a\n                    physical wave instead of a particle, but where de Broglie thought of the\n                    electron in terms of circular stationary waves, Schrdinger properly thought in\n                    terms of three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by\n                    the Greek letter psi, \xcf. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation\n                    of the \n                        wavefunction \xcf\n                        \n                            \n                                mathematical description of an atomic orbital that describes the\n                                    shape of the orbital; it can be used to calculate the\n                                    probability of finding the electron at any given location in the\n                                    orbital, as well as dynamical variables such as the energy and\n                                    the angular momentum\n                            \n                        \n                     that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the\n                    waves represented by \xcf are not physical waves but, instead, are complex\n                    probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction\n                    \xcf describes the probability of the quantum particle being\n                    present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be\n                    used to determine the distribution of the electrons density with respect to the\n                    nucleus in an atom. The general form of the Schrdinger equation is seen\n                    below.

Schrdingers work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists\n                    following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Sigma and Pi Bonds,"In addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also\n            affects their overlap (other than for two s orbitals, which are spherically symmetric).\n            Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a\n            direct line between the two nuclei. The diagrams below illustrates this for two p\n            orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to\n            end rather than at an angle.
The overlap of two s orbitals (as in H2), the overlap of an s orbital and a p\n            orbital (as in HCl), and the end-to-end overlap of two p orbitals (as in Cl2)\n            all produce sigma bonds (\xcf bonds), as illustrated below. A \xcf bond is a covalent bond in\n            which the electron density is concentrated in the region along the internuclear axis;\n            that is, a line between the nuclei would pass through the center of the overlap region.\n            Single bonds in Lewis structures are described as \xcf bonds in valence bond theory.
A pi bond (\xcf bond) is a type of covalent bond that results from the side-by-side overlap\n            of two p orbitals, as illustrated below. In a \xcf bond, the regions of orbital overlap lie\n            on opposite sides of the internuclear axis. Along the axis itself, there is a node, that\n            is, a plane with no probability of finding an electron.
While all single bonds are \xcf bonds, multiple bonds consist of both \xcf and \xcf bonds. As the\n            Lewis structures suggest, O2 contains a double bond, and N2\n            contains a triple bond. The double bond consists of one \xcf bond and one \xcf bond, and the\n            triple bond consists of one \xcf bond and two \xcf bonds. Between any two atoms, the first\n            bond formed will always be a \xcf bond, but there can only be one \xcf bond in any one\n            location. In any multiple bond, there will be one \xcf bond, and the remaining one or two\n            bonds will be \xcf bonds. These bonds are described in more detail later in this\n            module.
As seen in the table on the previous page, an average carbon-carbon single bond is 347\n            kJ/mol, while in a carbon-carbon double bond, the \xcf bond increases the bond strength by\n            267 kJ/mol. Adding an additional \xcf bond causes a further increase of 225 kJ/mol. We can\n            see a similar pattern when we compare other \xcf and \xcf bonds. Thus, each individual \xcf bond\n            is generally weaker than a corresponding \xcf bond between the same two atoms. In a \xcf bond,\n            there is a greater degree of orbital overlap than in a \xcf bond.
Butadiene, C4H6, is used to make synthetic rubber. Identify the number of \xcf and \xcf\n                bonds contained in this molecule.
There are six \xcf CH bonds and one \xcf CC bond, for a total of seven from the single\n                bonds. There are two double bonds that each have a \xcf bond in addition to the \xcf bond.\n                This gives a total nine \xcf and two \xcf bonds overall.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,The Mole,"The moleamount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12 is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It\n            provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of\n            matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of\n            discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a\n            sample of pure 12C weighing exactly 12 g. The mole provides\n                a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely\n                important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.\n
amount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12
The number of entities composing a mole is defined to be\n            6.02214179×1023, a fundamental constant named Avogadros number\n                (NA)defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo\n            Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of cper mole,d a\n            conveniently rounded version being 6.022×1023/mol.
defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole
Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the\n            same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. For example 1 mole of carbon\n            contains 6.022×1023 atoms of carbon and 1 mole of phosphorus contains 6.022×1023\n             atoms of phosphorus. The masses of 1 mole of different elements,\n            however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically\n            different. The molar massmass in grams of 1 mole of a substance of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of\n            that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). Because the\n            definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference\n            substance, 12C, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to\n            its atomic or formula weight in amu. The molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol (same value\n            as its atomic mass) and the molar mass of phosphorus is 30.97 g/mol (same value as its\n            atomic mass).
mass in grams of 1 mole of a substance
While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are\n            vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the\n            magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the\n            mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g. Although this represents\n            just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (approximately 18 g), it contains more water\n            molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among\n            the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100\n            billion molecules.
As we discussed, the molar mass of an element is numerically the same value as\n                    the atomic mass of that element listed on the periodic table. Likewise, the\n                    molar mass of a compound is numerically the same value as the formula mass for\n                    that compound. For example, the formula mass of NaCl is 58.44 amu. Therefore the\n                    molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g and the number of NaCl units is 6.022×1023.\n                         The formula mass of water H2O is 18.02 amu.\n                    Therefore the molar mass of water is 18.02 g and the number of water molecules\n                    in one mole of water is 6.022×1023.
*Note that one unit of a molecular(covalent) compound is referred to as a\n                    molecule. However, one unit of a ionic compound is referred to as a formula\n                    unit.

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Types of Crystalline Solids,"Crystalline solids are generally classified according the nature of the forces that hold\n            its particles together. These forces are primarily responsible for the physical\n            properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections provide descriptions of\n            the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and\n            molecular.
Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive\n                    and negative ions that are held together by electrostatic attractions, which can\n                    be quite strong. Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due\n                    to the very strong attractions between the ionsin ionic compounds, the\n                    attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the\n                    partial charges in polar molecular compounds. Although they are hard, they also\n                    tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not\n                    conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because\n                    their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a\n                    metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.
Metallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by\n                    metal atoms. The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform\n                    distribution of atomic nuclei within a csead of delocalized electrons. The atoms\n                    within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as\n                    metallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All\n                    exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and\n                    malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability\n                    (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and,\n                    therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting points of the metals\n                    vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt\n                    below 200 C. Several post-transition metals also have low melting points,\n                    whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above 1000 C. These\n                    differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the\n                    metals.
Covalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other\n                    nonmetals, and some covalent compounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and\n                    silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have\n                    networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a\n                    network of covalent bonds, as shown below. To break or to melt a covalent\n                    network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds are\n                    relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by\n                    hardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the\n                    hardest substances known and melts above 3500 C.
Molecular solids, such as ice, sucrose (table sugar), and iodine, as shown below\n                    , are composed of neutral molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces\n                    between the units present in different crystals vary widely, as indicated by the\n                    melting points of the crystals. Small symmetrical molecules (nonpolar\n                    molecules), such as H2, N2, O2, and\n                        F2, have weak attractive forces and form molecular solids with\n                    very low melting points (below  C). Substances consisting of larger,\n                    nonpolar molecules have larger attractive forces and melt at higher\n                    temperatures. Molecular solids composed of molecules with permanent dipole\n                    moments (polar molecules) melt at still higher temperatures. Examples include\n                    ice (melting point, 0 C) and table sugar (melting point, 185 C).

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions: Mass and Volume of Solution,"The examples on the previous page illustrate the ease with which the amounts of\n                      substances involved in a chemical reaction of known stoichiometry may be related.\n                      Directly measuring numbers of atoms and molecules is, however, not practical when\n                      working the the macroscopic world.

Our first step is to convert to moles, as it was previously.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,Waves,"Electromagnetic energy travels through space in waves. So understanding wave\n            characteristics is important in understanding electromagnetic energy. A wave is an\n            oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to\n            another. Common examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers\n            energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes\n            waves to ripple outward along the water\'s surface, and the expansion of air that\n            accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward\n            for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter\n            (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place.
Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. Electromagnetic waves consist of\n            an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which\n            are perpendicular to the direction of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at\n            a constant speed of \\(2.998\^8\\) m/s, the speed of light (denoted by c).
All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by: a\n            wavelength (denoted by \xce\xbb, the lowercase Greek letter lambda); a frequency (denoted by \xce\xbd,\n            the lowercase Greek letter nu); and an amplitude (denoted by A). As can be seen in diagrams below, the\n            wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured\n            in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an\n            enormous range - wavelengths of kilometers (103 m) to picometers\n            (10-12 m) have been observed. The frequency (the rate of oscillation) is the number of wave cycles\n            that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system,\n            time is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit\n            for frequency, expressed as cycles per second (s), is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples\n            of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = \\(1\^6\\) Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = \\(1\^9\\)\n            Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave\'s\n            displacement and so, as shown in the figure below, this corresponds to one-half the height between the\n            peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for\n            light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness. Brighter lights have a greater amplitude than dimmer lights and louder sounds have a greater amplitude than quieter sounds.
The product of a wave\'s wavelength (\xce\xbb) and its frequency (\xce\xbd), \xce\xbb\xce\xbd, is the speed of the\n                    wave. For electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum:
$$c\\;=\\;\\lambda\\nu$$
where c is the speed at which electromagnetic energy travels (\\(2.998\^8\\)>\n                    m/s).
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: as the wavelength increases, the\n            frequency decreases. The inverse proportionality is illustrated in figure below. This\n            figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of\n            electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific\n            frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light\n            makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies\n            developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for\n            reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for\n            different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as\n            frequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified\n            in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms).
A sodium streetlight gives off yellow light that has a wavelength of 589 nm \\(1\\;\\mathrm{nm}\\;=\\;1\^{-9}\\;\\mathrm m\\). What is the frequency of this light?
We can rearrange the equation c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd to solve for the frequency:
$$\\nu=\\frac c\\lambda\\;$$
Since c is expressed in meters per second, we must also convert 589 nm to meters.
$$\\require{cancel}\\nu=\\left(\\frac{2.998\^8\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm m}\\mathrm s^{-1}}{589\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{nm}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1\^9\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{nm}}}{1\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm m}}\\right)\\;=\\;5.09\^{14}\\;\\mathrm s^{-1}$$

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Module Summary and Quiz,"Some substances form crystalline solids consisting of particles in a very organized\n                structure; others form amorphous (noncrystalline) solids with an internal structure that\n                is not ordered. The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids,\n                covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of\n                crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the\n                arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them.\n                Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have\n                distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of\n                interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures.

Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Diffusion and Effusion of Gases,"If you have ever been in a room when a piping hot pizza was delivered, you have been made\n\t\t\taware of the fact that gaseous molecules can quickly spread throughout a room, as\n\t\t\tevidenced by the pleasant aroma that soon reaches your nose. Although gaseous molecules\n\t\t\ttravel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with other\n\t\t\tgaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired\n\t\t\ttarget. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions\n\t\t\tper second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between\n\t\t\tcollisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the mean\n\t\t\tfree path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the\n\t\t\tmolecule.
In general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed\n\t\t\tcontainer, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by\n\t\t\twhich molecules disperse in space in response to differences in concentration is called\n\t\t\tdiffusion (shown in Figure). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware of\n\t\t\tany concentration gradient, they simply move randomlyregions of higher concentration\n\t\t\thave more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of\n\t\t\tspecies from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment,\n\t\t\tdiffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, as depicted\n\t\t\tbelow. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations\n\t\t\tare the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net\n\t\t\ttransfer of molecules occurs).
We are often interested in the rate of diffusion, the amount of gas passing through some\n\t\t\tarea per unit time:
$$\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ diffusion} = \\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ of\\ gas\\ passing\\\n\t\t\t\tthrough\\ an\\ area}}{\\mathrm{unit\\ of\\ time}}$$
The diffusion rate depends on several factors: the concentration gradient (the increase\n\t\t\tor decrease in concentration from one point to another); the amount of surface area\n\t\t\tavailable for diffusion; and the distance the gas particles must travel. Note also that\n\t\t\tthe time required for diffusion to occur is inversely proportional to the rate of\n\t\t\tdiffusion, as shown in the rate of diffusion equation.
A process involving movement of gaseous species similar to diffusion is effusion, the\n\t\t\tescape of gas molecules through a tiny hole such as a pinhole in a balloon into a vacuum\n\t\t\t(Figure). Although diffusion and effusion rates both depend on the molar mass of the gas\n\t\t\tinvolved, their rates are not equal; however, the ratios of their rates are the same.
If a mixture of gases is placed in a container with porous walls, the gases effuse\n\t\t\tthrough the small openings in the walls. The lighter gases pass through the small\n\t\t\topenings more rapidly (at a higher rate) than the heavier ones (Figure). In 1832, Thomas\n\t\t\tGraham studied the rates of effusion of different gases and formulated Grahams law of\n\t\t\teffusion.
The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the\n\t\t\t\t\tmass of its particles:
$$\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion} \\propto\n\t\t\t\t\t\{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}}}$$
This means that if two gases A and B are at the same temperature and pressure, the\n\t\t\t\t\tratio of their effusion rates is inversely proportional to the ratio of the square\n\t\t\t\t\troots of the masses of their particles:
$$\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ A}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\\n\t\t\t\t\tB}} =\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{B}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{A}}}$$
Calculate the ratio of the rate of effusion of hydrogen to the rate of effusion of\n\t\t\t\toxygen.
$$\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ hydrogen}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ oxygen}} = \n\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{32.0\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}}{\\sqrt{2.0\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}} =\n\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{16}}{\\sqrt{1}} = \$$
Hydrogen effuses four times as rapidly as oxygen.
Heres another example, making the point about how determining times differs from\n\t\t\tdetermining rates.
It takes 243 s for 4.46  10 mol Xe to effuse through a tiny hole. Under\n\t\t\t\tthe same conditions, how long will it take 4.46  10 mol Ne to\n\t\t\t\teffuse?
It is important to resist the temptation to use the times directly, and to remember\n\t\t\t\thow rate relates to time as well as how it relates to mass. Recall the definition of\n\t\t\t\trate of effusion:
$$\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ diffusion} = \\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ of\\ gas\\ passing\\\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough\\ an\\ area}}{\\mathrm{unit\\ of\\ time}}$$
and combine it with Graham\'s law:
$$\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ Xe}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\\n\t\t\t\t\tNe}} =\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Ne}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Xe}}}$$
$$\\frac{\\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ Xe\\ transferred}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\\n\t\t\t\t\tXe}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ Ne\\ transferred}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne}}} =\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Ne}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Xe}}}$$
Noting that amount of A = amount of B, and solving for time for Ne:
$$\\require{cancel} \\frac{\\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{amount\\ Xe\\\n\t\t\t\t\ttransferred}}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Xe}}}{\\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{amount\\ Ne\\\n\t\t\t\t\ttransferred}}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\\n\t\t\t\t\tNe}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Xe}} =\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Ne}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Xe}}}$$
and substitute values:
$$\\frac{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne}}{243 \\mathrm{s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{20.2\\\n\t\t\t\t\t\\mathrm{g/mol}}{131.3\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}} = 0.392$$
Finally, solve for the desired quantity:
$$\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne} = 0.392 \\times 243\\ \\mathrm{s} = 95.3\\ \n\t\t\t\t\t\\mathrm{s}$$
Note that this answer is reasonable: Since Ne is lighter than Xe, the effusion rate\n\t\t\t\tfor Ne will be larger than that for Xe, which means the time of effusion for Ne will\n\t\t\t\tbe smaller than that for Xe.
The following example demonstrates how comparing the effusion rate of an unknown gas to\n\t\t\tthat of a known gas can be used to calculate the molar mass of the unknown gas.
An unknown gas effuses 1.66 times more rapidly than CO2. What is the molar mass of\n\t\t\t\tthe unknown gas? Can you make a reasonable guess as to its identity?
From Graham\'s law, we have:
$$\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ unknown}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\\n\t\t\t\t\teffusion\\ of\\ CO_2}} =\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{unknown}}}$$
Plug in known data:
$$\\frac{1.66}1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{44.0\n\t\t\t\t\t\\mathrm{g/mol}}}{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{unknown}}$$
Solve:
$$\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{unknown} = \\frac{44.0 \\mathrm{g/mol}}{(1.66)^2} = 16.0\\ \n\t\t\t\t\t\\mathrm{g/mol}$$
The gas could well be CH4, the only gas with this molar mass.

Solutions,Solubility,Electrolytes,"As discussed in an earlier unit, when some substances are dissolved in water they yield\n            ions in solution. These substances constitute an important class of compounds called\n            electrolytes. Substances that do not yield ions when dissolved are called\n            nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is\n            essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the\n            substance is known as a strong electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the\n            dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a weak\n            electrolyte.
Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the\n            electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct\n            electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is\n            the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged\n            entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved\n            ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to\n            electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of\n            dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or\n            qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit .
Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions. The electrostatic\n                    attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole\n                    attraction. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic\n                    compounds in water.
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and\n                    disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and\n                    solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This\n                    process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most\n                    conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,\n                    and so they are classified as strong electrolytes.
Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to\n                    water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water\n                    molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they\n                    attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water\n                    molecules penetrate between individual K+ and Cl ions and\n                    surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together\n                    and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as seen in the\n                    illustration below. The reduction of the electrostatic attraction permits the\n                    independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution, resulting in an\n                    increase in the disorder of the system as the ions change from their fixed and\n                    ordered positions in the crystal to mobile and much more disordered states in\n                    solution. This increased disorder is responsible for the dissolution of many\n                    ionic compounds, including KCl, which dissolve with absorption of heat.
In other cases, the electrostatic attractions between the ions in a crystal are\n                    so large, or the ion-dipole attractive forces between the ions and water\n                    molecules are so weak, that the increase in disorder cannot compensate for the\n                    energy required to separate the ions, and the crystal is insoluble. Such is the\n                    case for compounds such as calcium carbonate (limestone), calcium phosphate (the\n                    inorganic component of bone), and iron oxide (rust).
Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very\n                    slightly ionizedonly about two out of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25\n                    C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton (H+\n                    ion) to another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions.
In some cases, we find that solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct\n                    electricity because the solute molecules react chemically with the solvent to\n                    produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of\n                    covalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, when we dissolve\n                    hydrogen chloride in water, we find that the solution is a very good conductor.\n                    The water molecules play an essential part in forming ions: Solutions of\n                    hydrogen chloride in many other solvents, such as benzene, do not conduct\n                    electricity and do not contain ions.
Hydrogen chloride is an acid, and so its molecules react with water, transferring\n                    H+ ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) and chloride ions (Cl):
This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a strong acid\n                    and, consequently, a strong electrolyte). Likewise, weak acids and bases that\n                    only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when\n                    dissolved in water and are classified as weak electrolytes.

Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Standard Enthalpy of Formation,"Standard enthalpies of formation provide a convenient means to calculate the enthalpy of\n            reactions. A standard enthalpy of formation, \n                \n                    \xce\n                    \n                        H\n                        f\n                        o\n                    \n                \n            , of a pure substance is the enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1\n            mole of that substance is formed from the elements in their most stable states under\n            standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or\n            predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to\n            carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have\n            values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the\n            enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hesss\n            law.
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is .5 kJ/mol. This is the\n            enthalpy change for the reaction that forms CO2(g) from the elements:
The reactants are the elements in their cstandard statesd, which is the most stable form\n            of the element at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 C. For the element carbon, the standard\n            state is graphite, because this is the most stable form of carbon under at 1 atm and 25\n            C. For oxygen, the standard state is O2(g). The product of the formation\n            reaction is one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 C. For nitrogen dioxide,\n                NO2(g), \n                \n                    \xce\n                    \n                        H\n                        f\n                        o\n                    \n                    \n                \n             is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
A reaction equation with 1/2 mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is\n            correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole\n            of product, NO2(g).
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in\n            this  Table of Thermodynamic Properties. These values indicate that\n            formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as  kJ/mol for the formation\n            of P4O10) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the\n            formation of acetylene, C2H2). Note that the standard enthalpy of\n            formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero.
Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic\n                process.

Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,The Discovery of the Electron,"In the two centuries since Dalton developed his ideas, scientists have made\n                    significant progress in furthering our understanding of atomic theory. Much of\n                    this came from the results of several seminal experiments that revealed the\n                    details of the internal structure of atoms. Here, we will discuss some of those\n                    key developments, with an emphasis on application of the scientific method, as\n                    well as understanding how the experimental evidence was analyzed. While the\n                    historical persons and dates behind these experiments can be quite interesting,\n                    it is most important to understand the concepts resulting from their work.
If matter were composed of atoms, what were atoms composed of? Were they the\n                    smallest particles, or was there something smaller? In the late 1800s, a number\n                    of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical\n                    discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most\n                    significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode\n                    ray tube. Review the slideshow below to learn about Thomson\'s cathode ray\n                    experiments.
Although controversial at the time, Thomsons idea was gradually accepted, and\n                    his cathode ray particle is what we now call an electronA negatively charged subatomic particle., a negatively charged,\n                    subatomic particle with a mass more than one thousand-times less that of an\n                    atom. The term celectrond was coined in 1891 by Irish physicist George Stoney,\n                    from celectric ion.d
A negatively charged subatomic particle.
In 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist\n                    Robert A. Millikan via his coil dropd experiments. Millikan created microscopic\n                    oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or\n                    by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their\n                    downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in\n                    the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful\n                    measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the\n                    charge on individual drops.
Looking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that\n                    the charge of an oil droplet is always a multiple of a specific charge, 1.6 X\n                        10 C. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a\n                    fundamental chargethe charge of a single electronwith his measured charges due\n                    to an excess of one electron (1 times 1.6 X 10 C), two electrons\n                    (2 times 1.6 X 10 C), three electrons (3 times 1.6 X\n                        10 C), and so on, on a given oil droplet. Since the charge of\n                    an electron was now known due to Millikans research, and the charge-to-mass\n                    ratio was already known due to Thomsons research (1.759 X 1011\n                    C/kg), it only required a simple calculation to determine the mass of the\n                    electron as well.
Scientists had now established that the atom was not indivisible as Dalton had\n                    believed, and due to the work of Thomson, Millikan, and others, the charge and\n                    mass of the negative, subatomic particlesthe electronswere known. However, the\n                    positively charged part of an atom was not yet well understood. In 1904, Thomson\n                    proposed the cplum puddingd model of atoms, which described a positively charged\n                    mass with an equal amount of negative charge in the form of electrons embedded\n                    in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Calculating Formal Charge,"Previously, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. However, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal chargescharge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons) to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.
charge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons)
The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.
Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:
Formal Charge
We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.

Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Gas Density and Molar Mass,"One important application of the ideal gas law is to determine its molar mass and thereby\n            assist in its identification using the measured density of the gas. Review the\n            interactive below to see the derivation of the formula used to calculate the molar mass\n            of a gas from its density.
Press ""NEXT"" to advance slide show.
The molar mass of a gas can be determined given its density, temperature, and pressure\n            with the following equation:
$$\\require{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}$$
Where d = density, R = ideal gas law\n            constant, T = temperature, and P = pressure.
A gas was found to have a density of 0.0847 g/L at 17.0 C and a pressure of 760\n                torr. What is its molar mass? What is the gas?
$$\\require{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}$$
As before when using the ideal gas law constant, we need to ensure that the units in\n                the constant match the units used for the other variables and as before when using\n                the ideal gas law equation temperature must be in K. First we will convert the\n                pressure to units of atm. You will recall that 760 torr = 1 atm.
$$\\require{cancel} \\require{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{(0.0847\n                    \\mathrm{g/}\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}})( 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(290\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}}$$
$$\\require{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = 2.02 \\mathrm{g/mol}$$
The gas is hydrogen, H2.
This equation can also be used to determine the density of a known gas at a given\n            temperature and pressure.
Calculate the density of chlorine gas (Cl2) at 22 oC and 735 torr.
We can use the molar mass of a gas equation,
$$\\require{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}$$
rearranging it to solve for density.
$$\\require{mathrsfs} d = \\frac{\\mathscr{M}P}{RT}$$
Because we know the identity of the gas, we can easily calculate its molar mass and\n                substitute it and the other given values (making the necessary conversions) into the\n                equation.
$$\\require{cancel} d = \\frac{(70.90 \\mathrm{g/}\\\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.967 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}})}{ (0.08206\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L} \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(295 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})} = 2.83\n                    \\mathrm{g/L}$$

\n                   Where c\n                   is the specific heat of the substance,\n                   m\n                   is its mass, and \xceT\n                   (which is read cdelta Td) is the temperature change,\n                   Tfinal  Tinitial.
If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is\n            higher than its initial temperature, Tfinal  Tinitial has a positive value, and the value of q is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its\n            temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, Tfinal  Tinitial\n            has a negative value, and the value of q is negative.
A flask containing 8.0  102 g of water is heated, and the temperature of\n                the water increases from 21 C to 85 C. How much heat did the water absorb?
To answer this question, consider these factors:
The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 C requires\n                4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 C, we\n                will need 800 times as much to heat 800 g of water by 1 C. Finally, we observe that\n                since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 C, we will need 64 times as\n                much to heat it by 64 C (that is, from 21 C to 85 C).
This can be summarized using the equation:

Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and q is positive.
A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g. When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat,\n                its temperature increases from 22.4 C to 43.6 C. Determine the specific heat of\n                this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity).
Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine\n                its specific heat using the relationship:
Substituting the known values:
Solving:
Comparing this value with the values in the table of Specific Heats of Common\n                    Substances, this value matches the specific heat of aluminum,\n                which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.",
Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Hybrid Atomic Orbitals,"Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how\n            chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with\n            more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example,\n            let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two\n            hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration\n                1s22s22p4, with two unpaired electrons (one in each\n            of the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two OH bonds form\n            from the overlap of these two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If\n            this were the case, the bond angle would be 90, as shown below, because p orbitals are\n            perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5,\n            not 90. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world\n            observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.
Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O\n            differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with\n            the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave\n            function, \xcf, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of\n            electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave\n            functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes.\n            This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization\n            and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO,\n            (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are\n            called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital\n            and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule\n            differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward\n            the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals\n            should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5). The observed angle of 104.5 is\n            experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful\n            explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate\n            predictions.
The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Intermolecular Forces Introduction,"We saw on the previous page that the conditions under which phase changes occur\n                    for ionic compounds are determined by the strength of the ionic bond that holds\n                    the ions together. For molecular compounds, it is strength of intermolecular forces (IMFs) that affect the\n                    conditions under which phase changes occur. In the rest of this module, we will explore three types of intermolecular forces:\n
Under appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will\n                    cause them to form liquids or solids. This is due to intermolecular forces, not\n                    intramolecular forces. Intramolecular forces are those within the molecule that\n                    keep the molecule together, the covalent bonds between the atoms discussed\n                    previously in this course. Intermolecular forces are the attractions between\n                    molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance. The\n                    diagram below illustrates these different molecular forces. The IMFs that exist\n                    between molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces (covalent\n                    bonds) that bond atoms together within a molecule. For example, to overcome the\n                    IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it into gaseous HCl requires only\n                    about 17 kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the hydrogen\n                    and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl requires about 25 times more energy\n                    kilojoules.
The conditions under which a phase change occurs for a molecular substance is\n                    determined by the strength of its IMF(s). The relative strengths of the covalent\n                    bonds of a molecular substance have no impact on melting point or boiling\n                    point.
Watch the videos. For each of the processes that is occurring,\n                        determine which type of attractive force is being broken and the energy\n                        required to overcome that force.

Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Internal Energy,"Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or\n            removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms\n            or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased\n            translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or\n            molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the amplitudes of these motions decrease and the\n            kinetic energy falls. The total of all energy present in a substance, including both\n            kinetic and potential energy, is called the internal energy (E).\n            As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be\n            transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system.\n            A system is defined as the substance or substances undergoing chemical or physical\n            change of interest. The surroundings can be defined as everything else in the\n            universe.
The change in internal energy or E is\n                           defined by the equation below.\n
E is negative when the system releases energy to\n                           the surroundings. E is positive when\n                               the system gains energy from the surroundings.
Chemists use graphs to depict changes in internal energy. The vertical axis of\n                    these graphs represents the internal energy. Use the arrows below the following\n                    figures to see how such graphs represent processes in which a system loses or\n                    gains energy from the surroundings.
When the initial state of the system is greater than the final state of the\n                    system, due to the system losing energy to the surroundings, E is negative.
When the initial state of the system is lower than the final state of the system,\n                    due to the system gaining energy to the surroundings, E is positive.
Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat (q) from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (w) on the system. For example, energy is transferred\n                    into a room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire\n                    absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth\n                    (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes\n                    increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in\n                    the wires temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when\n                    heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the\n                    surroundings.
The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be\n                           represented by the equation:
where E is internal energy, q is heat, and w\n                           is work.
Chemists use the following sign conventions for q and w:
A strategy that you can use to remember this is to view the world from the\n                    system\'s perspective.
The sign of E specifies whether the process is\n                    exothermic or endothermic. If E < 0 the system has\n                    released energy to the surroundings and the process is exothermic. If E > 0 the system has absorbed energy from the\n                    surroundings and the process is endothermic.
This is a mathematical representation of the first law of thermodynamics. It\n                    shows that there are two ways to change the internal energy of a system: heat\n                    flow into or out of the system (positive q is heat flow\n                    in; negative q is heat flow out) and work done on or by\n                    the system ( positive w if work is done on the system and negative w if work\n                    is done by the system). Remember that energy is conserved: Energy can be\n                    transformed from one form to another and transferred from one substance to\n                    another, but it is neither created nor destroyed. Therefore, any decrease in\n                    internal energy of a system must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in\n                    internal energy of the surroundings, and vice versa.
A system absorbs 55 kJ of heat from its surroundings, while doing 13 kJ of work on\n                the surroundings. Calculate E and determine whether the\n                process is exothermic or endothermic.
Using the equation:
Heat is being absorbed by the system from the surroundings, therefore the value for\n                    q is positive.
Work is being done by the system on the surroundings, therefore the value for w is negative.
E is positive meaning more energy has flowed from the\n                surroundings to the system, therefore the process is endothermic.
The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as\n                        E = q + w. Internal energy is a type of quantity known as a state function (or\n                    state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a\n                    state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how\n                    that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value\n                    does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is\n                    altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at\n                    an altitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter whether you hiked there or\n                    parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however,\n                    is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a\n                    more roundabout, circuitous path. The distances traveled would differ (distance\n                    is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude\n                    is a state function).","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show."
Reactions and Stoichiometry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemical Reactions and Equations,Equations for Ionic Reactions,"Given the abundance of water on earth, it stands to reason that a great many chemical\n            reactions take place in aqueous media. When ions are involved in these reactions, the\n            chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail appropriate to their\n            intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking\n            place in an aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and\n                AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous\n                Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl:
This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation\n            because it doesnt explicitly represent the ionic species that are present in solution.\n            When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate into their constituent ions,\n            which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a\n            thorough discussion of this important process is provided later in the course). Ionic\n            compounds dissolved in water are, therefore, more realistically represented as\n            dissociated ions, in this case:
Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant\n            extent, as signified by its physical state notation, s.
Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this\n            particular case, the formulas for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas\n            for their dissociated ions:
Examining this equation shows that two chemical species are present in identical form on\n            both sides of the arrow, Ca2+(aq) and NO3(aq). These \n                spectator ions\n                \n                    \n                        An ion that remains unchanged from the reactant to the products side of\n                            an equation.\n                    \n                \n             ions whose presence is required to maintain charge neutralityare neither\n            chemically nor physically changed by the process, and so they may be eliminated from the\n            equation to yield a more succinct representation called a \n                net ionic equation\n                \n                    \n                        A chemical equation written such that all dissociated ions are shown as\n                            such in the equation.\n                    \n                \n            :

A chemical equation written such that all dissociated ions are shown as\n                            such in the equation.
Following the convention of using the smallest possible integers as coefficients, this\n            equation is then written:
This net ionic equation indicates that solid silver chloride may be produced from\n            dissolved chloride and silver(I) ions, regardless of the source of these ions. These\n            molecular and complete ionic equations provide additional information, namely, the ionic\n            compounds used as sources of Cl and Ag+.
When carbon dioxide is dissolved in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, the\n                mixture reacts to yield aqueous sodium carbonate and liquid water. Write balanced\n                molecular, complete ionic, and net ionic equations for this process.
Begin by identifying formulas for the reactants and products and arranging them\n                properly in chemical equation form:
Balance is achieved easily in this case by changing the coefficient for NaOH to 2,\n                resulting in the molecular equation for this reaction:

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Ionic Radii,"Ionic radius is the measure used to describe the\r\n\t\t\tsize of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the same number of protons as\r\n\t\t\tthe parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived, as seen in the\r\n\t\t\tfigure below for the aluminum atom and ion. For example, the covalent radius of an\r\n\t\t\taluminum atom (1s22s22p63s23p1)\r\n\t\t\tis 118 pm, whereas the ionic radius of an Al3+\r\n\t\t\t(1s22s22p6) is 68 pm. As electrons are removed from\r\n\t\t\tthe outer valence shell, the remaining core electrons occupying smaller shells\r\n\t\t\texperience a greater effective nuclear charge Zeff\r\n\t\t\t(as discussed previously) and are drawn even closer to the nucleus.
Cations with larger charges are smaller than\r\n\t\t\tcations with smaller charges (e.g., V2+ has an ionic radius of 79 pm, while\r\n\t\t\tthat of V3+ is 64 pm). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, we\r\n\t\t\tfind that cations of successive elements with the same charge generally have larger\r\n\t\t\tradii, corresponding to an increase in the principal quantum number, n.
An anion (negative ion) is formed by the addition\r\n\t\t\tof one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This results in a greater\r\n\t\t\trepulsion among the electrons and a decrease in Zeff\r\n\t\t\tper electron. Both effects (the increased number of electrons and the decreased Zeff) cause the radius of an anion to be larger than\r\n\t\t\tthat of the parent atom, as seen in the figure above for the sulfur atom and ion. For\r\n\t\t\texample, a sulfur atom ([Ne]3s23p4) has a covalent radius of 104\r\n\t\t\tpm, whereas the ionic radius of the sulfide anion ([Ne]3s23p6) is\r\n\t\t pm. For consecutive elements proceeding down any group, anions have larger principal\r\n\t\t\tquantum numbers and, thus, larger radii.
Atoms and ions that have the same electron\r\n\t\t\tconfiguration are said to be isoelectronic. Examples of isoelectronic species are N\r\n\t\t, O 2, F , Ne, Na+, Mg2+,\r\n\t\t\tand Al3+ (1s22s22p6). Another isoelectronic\r\n\t\t\tseries is P3, S2, Cl, Ar, K+,\r\n\t\t+, and Sc3+ ([Ne]3s23p6). For atoms\r\n\t\t\tor ions that are isoelectronic, the number of protons determines the size. The greater\r\n\t\t\tthe nuclear charge, the smaller the radius in a series of isoelectronic ions and atoms

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ions,"Atoms are electrically neutral having the same number of protons and electrons. However,\n            under certain circumstances atoms can become electrically charged. When an atom becomes\n            electrically charged it is called an ionAn atom that has gained or lost electrons and therefore is electrically charged.. As will be discussed in more detail later in\n            this unit, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing\n            electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and\n            is called an anionA negatively charged ion.. Positively charged atoms called cationsA positively charged ion. are formed when an atom\n            loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11\n            electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11\n             10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two\n            electrons it will become an anion with a 2 charge (8  10 = 2).

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Lattice Energy,"An ionic compound is stable because of the electrostatic attraction between its positive\n            and negative ions. The lattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this\n            attraction. The lattice energy (\xceHlattice)energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its component gaseous ions of an\n            ionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into\n            its component gaseous ions. For the ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy\n            change of the process:
energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its component gaseous ions
Note that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so\n            our lattice energies will be endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the\n            equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the energy released when\n            separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus,\n            if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which\n            definition is being used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates\n            a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, \xceHlattice = 769 kJ. Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of\n            solid NaCl into gaseous Na+ and Cl ions. When one mole each of\n            gaseous Na+ and Cl ions form solid NaCl, 769 kJ of heat is released.
The lattice energy \xceHlattice of an ionic crystal can\n                    be expressed by the following equation (derived from Coulombs law, governing the forces\n                    between electric charges):
in which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal\n                    structure; Z+ and Z are the charges on the ions; and \n                    Ro is the\n                    interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions).
\n            The lattice energy of an ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase\n            and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other parameters are kept constant,\n            doubling the charge of both the cation and anion quadruples the lattice energy. For\n            example, the lattice energy of LiF (Z+ and Z = 1) is 1023 kJ/mol,\n            whereas that of MgO (Z+ and Z = 2) is 3900 kJ/mol (Ro is nearly the sameabout 200 pm for both\n            compounds).
Different interatomic distances produce different lattice energies. For example, we can\n            compare the lattice energy of MgF2 (2957 kJ/mol) to that of MgI2\n            (2327 kJ/mol) to observe the effect on lattice energy of the smaller ionic size of\n            F as compared to I. The difference between lattice energies\n            of compounds is significantly more dependent on the charges of the ions rather than the\n            size of the ions because the variations between the sizes of the ions is relatively\n            small.
Which has the larger lattice energy, Al2O3 or\n                Al2Se3?
In these two ionic compounds, the charges Z+ and Z are the\n                same, so the difference in lattice energy will depend upon Ro. The\n                O2 ion is smaller than the Se2 ion. Thus,\n                Al2O3 would have a shorter interionic distance than\n                Al2Se3, and Al2O3 would have the\n                larger lattice energy.

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Limiting Reactants,"The relative amounts of reactants and products represented in a balanced chemical\n            equation are often referred to as stoichiometric amounts. All the exercises of the\n            preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, when\n            calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was\n            assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or\n            greater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants\n            are not present in stoichiometric amounts.
Consider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches:
Stoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese\n            slices in a 2:1 ratio. Provided with 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese, one may\n            prepare 11 sandwiches per the provided recipe, using all the provided cheese and having\n            six slices of bread left over. In this scenario, the number of sandwiches prepared has\n            been limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been provided in\n            excess.
Consider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen\n            with chlorine to yield hydrogen chloride:
The balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric\n            ratio. If these reactants are provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will\n            nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting the amount of product that may be\n            generated. This substance is the limiting reactantreactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated, and the other substance is the\n            excess reactantreactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation\n            requires computing the molar amounts of each reactant provided and comparing them to the\n            stoichiometric amounts represented in the balanced chemical equation. For example,\n            imagine combining 3 moles of H2 and 2 moles of Cl2.\n            This represents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction,\n            which is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Hydrogen, therefore, is present\n            in excess, and chlorine is the limiting reactant. Reaction of all the provided chlorine\n            (2 mol) will consume 2 mol of the 3 mol of hydrogen provided, leaving 1 mol of hydrogen\n            unreacted.
reactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated
reactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry
An alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the\n            amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant\n            amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per\n            the reactions stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the\n            limiting reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the\n            hydrogen would yield
Complete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce
The chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced.\n            Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl, there will be unreacted\n            hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting\n            reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant.

Silicon nitride is a very hard, high-temperature-resistant ceramic used as a\n                component of turbine blades in jet engines. It is prepared according to the\n                following equation:
Which is the limiting reactant when 2.00 g of Si and 1.50 g of N2\n                react?
After you have determined the limiting reactant, calculate the mass of\n                Si3N4 that will be produced.
Compute the provided molar amounts of reactants, and then compare these amounts to\n                the balanced equation to identify the limiting reactant.
The provided Si:N2 molar ratio is:
The stoichiometric Si:N2 ratio is:
Comparing these ratios shows that Si is provided in a less-than-stoichiometric\n                amount, and so it is the limiting reactant.
Alternatively, compute the amount of product expected for complete reaction of each\n                of the provided reactants.
Since silicon yields the lesser amount of product, it is the limiting reactant.
Now that we know that silicon is the limiting reactant, we can determine the mass of\n                the product produced. The amount of product(s) produced is always determined by the\n                amount of the limiting reactant.
We have previously calculated that 0.02373 mol Si3N4 is\n                produced by the limiting reactant. Convert mol Si3N4 to g\n                Si3N4.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Molarity,"Concentrations of solutions may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of\n            measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. Molarity (M)unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution is a useful\n            concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number\n            of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution.
unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution
A 355mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the\n                molar concentration of sucrose in the beverage?
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the\n                molarity can be calculated using the definition of molarity. Per this definition,\n                the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:
How much sugar (mol) is contained in 10 mL of the soda described in the example\n                above?
In this case, we can rearrange the definition of molarity to isolate the quantity\n                sought, moles of sugar. We then substitute the value for molarity that we derived in\n                the previous example, 0.375 M.
Distilled white vinegar is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H,\n                in water. A 0.500L vinegar solution contains 25.2 g of acetic acid. What is the\n                concentration of the acetic acid solution in units of molarity?
To calculate the molarity, you need mol of solute. Convert grams of acetic acid to\n                mol.
Substitute the values for mol and L into the definition of molarity.
How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30M solution?
The volume and molarity of the solution are specified. We can rearrange the\n                definition of molarity to isolate mole.
mol solute = M  L solution
Finally, this molar amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:
When performing calculations stepwise, it is important to refrain from rounding any\n            intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result.\n            In the previous example, the molar amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol,\n            would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be reported; however, although the\n            last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the\n            intermediate calculation. If we had not retained this guard digit, the final calculation\n            for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g.
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, we can also avoid\n            rounding errors by performing computations in a single step. This eliminates\n            intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.
In many situations you will be concerned with the molarity of a solution as\n                    described above. However, sometimes it may be useful to consider the\n                    concentration of individual ions in solution. Remember the equation for\n                    molarity:
When ionic compounds are dissolved in water they dissociate into their\n                    constituent ions. When sodium chloride, NaCl, is dissolved in water it produces one\n                        Na+ and one Cl ion per formula unit dissolved.\n                    However, when calcium chloride, CaCl2, is dissolved in water it produces one\n                        Ca2+ and two Cl ions per formula unit\n                    dissolved. This means that the concentration of Cl ions will be\n                    twice the concentration of Ca2+ ions when CaCl2 is\n                    dissolved in water. Likewise the concentration of Cl ions will be\n                    twice the concentration of the solution.
Animations developed from PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado\n                    Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu.
The solution of CaCl2 in the right animation has twice the\n                    concentration of Cl to Ca2+.
What is the concentration in molarity of a CaCl2 solution in which 4.85 g\n                of CaCl2 has been dissolved in water to form 850 mL of solution? What is\n                the concentration in molarity of the Ca2+ ions in the solution\n                and the Cl ions in the solution?
Calculating the molarity of the CaCl2 solution is the same process as we\n                have seen previously.
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
Since there is one Ca2+ ion produced per formula unit of\n                    CaCl2, the concentration of Ca2+ is also 0.0514\n                M.
Since there are two Cl ions produced per formula unit of\n                CaCl2, the concentration of Cl is:
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Ca2+ is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Cl is 0.103 M.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Mole Conversions: Single Step,"The relationships between formula mass, the mole, and Avogadros number can be\n                    applied to compute various quantities that describe the composition of\n                    substances and compounds. For example, if we know the mass and chemical\n                    composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate\n                    number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of\n                    moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and\n                    calculate the substances mass.

The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is\n                        requested. Referring to the periodic table, the atomic mass of K is 39.10\n                        amu, and so its molar mass is 39.10 g/mol.
We can use this relationship between mol of K and g of K as a conversion\n                        factor and solve using dimensional analysis.
We can see when we set up the dimensional analysis that we will divide by the\n                        molar mass for the answer.

We can use this relationship between mol of\n                            C6H8O6 and g of\n                            C6H8O6 as a conversion factor and solve\n                        using dimensional analysis.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Quantum Numbers,"The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in\n\t\t\tatoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory\n\t\t\tprovides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to\n\t\t\tchemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy\n\t\t\t\t\tlevels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an\n\t\t\t\t\tatom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and\n\t\t\t\t\tcan jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n =\n\t\t\t\t, 2, 3, . Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater\n\t\t\t\t\tfor greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum numberquantum number specifying the shell an electron occupies in an atom. The principle\n\t\t\t\t\tquantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the\n\t\t\t\t\tsame concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the\n\t\t\t\t\tprincipal quantum number is the shell number. The shellsset of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n of an atom can be\n\t\t\t\t\tthought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that\n\t\t\t\t\tbelong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding\n\t\t\t\t\tcircular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber, and so the higher the energy level. The positively charged protons in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the\n\t\t\t\t\tenergy it has.

set of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n
The principal quantum number, n, is one of three quantum\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbitalmathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables, which is distinct\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most\n\t\t\t\t\tprobable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of\n\t\t\t\t\tfinding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is\n\t\t\t\t\tbased on solutions of the Schrdinger equation. In addition, the principle\n\t\t\t\t\tquantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like\n\t\t\t\t\tatom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region\n\t\t\t\t\tin which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions\n\t\t\t\t\tare located. The values for n can be positive whole\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...
mathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables
Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantumquantum number distinguishing the different shapes of orbitals; it is also a measure of the orbital angular momentum\n\t\t\t\t\tnumber. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on the\n\t\t\t\t\tvalues, l = 0, 1, 2, , n  1.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only one\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number defines\n\t\t\t\t\tthe general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshellset of orbitals in an atom with the same values of n and l. In addition, the\n\t\t\t\t\tgreater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentum\n\t\t\t\t\tof an electron at this orbital.

Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitalsspherical region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 0. An electron in this orbital is called an s electron (or the s\n\t\t\t\t\tsubshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitalsdumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a p electron. The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitalsregion of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2. An electron in this orbital is called a d electron, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitalsmultilobed region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 3. An electron in this orbital is called an f electron for l =\n\t\t\t\t, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider.

The subshell which exist within the shells exhibit different shapes of electron densitya measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function \xcf. The value of the Magnetic Quantum Number, ml, indicates the region that an electron occupies\n\t\t\t\t\twithin a subshell based on the shape of the subshell.
a measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function \xcf
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical, as seen in the diagram\n\t\t\t\t\tbelow.
For the s subshell there is only one region, the sphere, in which an electron\n\t\t\t\t\tcan reside. Therefore in the s subshell there is only one value for ml, which is designated 0. Each region of\n\t\t\t\t\telectron density of a subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. Since the s\n\t\t\t\t\tsubshell only has one region of electron density the maximum number of electrons\n\t\t\t\t\tfor any s subshell is 2.
The shape of the p sublevel is more complex than the s sublevel, consisting of 3\n\t\t\t\t\tdumbbell-shaped orbitals originating from a center origin and along the x, y, and z axis as seen in the diagram below.
Within a p subshell electrons may reside in one of the three dumbbell-shaped\n\t\t\t\t\tregions. Therefore, within the p subshell there are three possible values for\n\t\t\t\t\tml, which are -1, 0, 1. Because there are three regions of\n\t\t\t\t\telectron density in a p subshell, a maximum of 6 electrons can occupy any p\n\t\t\t\t\tsubshell.
The shape of the d subshell is even more complex as seen in the diagram below.\n\t\t\t\t\tDescribing the exact shape of the regions of electron density is not important\n\t\t\t\t\tfor our purposes, but you do need to recognize there are a total of five regions\n\t\t\t\t\tof electron density within this subshell. Therefore for the d subshell, there\n\t\t\t\t\tare five possible values for ml which are designated -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe five regions of electron density, indicate that any d subshell can hold 10\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons.
As you might expect, the shapes of the regions of electron density are even more\n\t\t\t\t\tcomplex within the f subshell. Again, knowing the specific of the shapes is not\n\t\t\t\t\timportant for our purposes, however you should recognize that there are seven\n\t\t\t\t\tregions of electron density. Therefore there are seven possible values for\n\t\t\t\t\tml within the f subshell, which are designated -3, -2,\n\t\t\t\t\t-1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A maximum of 14 electrons can occupy the seven regions of\n\t\t\t\t\telectron density in a f subshell.

Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for CO2.
We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:
This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atomeach double\n                bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using\n                VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves\n                on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180. The electron-pair\n                geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are\n                linear.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for BCl3.
We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:
Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of\n                electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives\n                a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The BCl bonds lie in a plane with 120\n                angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular structure.\n
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a water molecule.

We predict that these four regions are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion. Thus, the\n                electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular structure is bent with an\n                angle slightly less than 109.5. In fact, the bond angle is 104.5.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of SF4.
The Lewis structure of SF4 indicates five regions of electron density\n                around the sulfur atom: one lone pair and four bonding pairs:
We predict that these five regions of electron density are arranged to give a\n                trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry. The one lone-pair on the sulfur will\n                occupy a position in the equitorial plane, giving a seesaw molecular geometry.
When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular\n                    structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do\n                    not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms\n                    that each possess a clocald geometry. The way these local structures are\n                    oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but\n                    such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory\n                    discussion. For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local\n                    structures.
The Lewis structure for the simplest amino acid, glycine,\n                            H2NCH2CO2H, is shown here. Predict the\n                        local geometry for the nitrogen atom, the two carbon atoms, and the oxygen\n                        atom with a hydrogen atom attached:
Consider each central atom independently.

We can use the wedge and dash notation when drawing the Lewis structure to\n                        better represent the local shapes within the molecule.

We observe a physical \n                    change when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses \n                    into liquid water. Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and \n                    demagnetizing metals (as is done with common anti-theft security tags) and \n                    grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes \n                    in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, \n                    form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.

Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Pressure and Temperature,"During the seventeenth and especially\r\n\t\t\t\t\teighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a quest\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto make balloons in which they could fly, a number of scientists established the\r\n\t\t\t\t\trelationships between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although their measurements\r\n\t\t\t\t\twere not precise by todays standards, they were able to determine the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gasa hypothetical\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconstruct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthese individual laws were combined into a single equationthe ideal gas\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlawthat relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tindividual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historical\r\n\t\t\t\t\torder), then put them together in the ideal gas law.
Imagine filling a rigid container attached\r\n\t\t\t\t\tto a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas may\r\n\t\t\t\t\tescape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressure is observed to decrease. Since the container is rigid and tightly\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we heat\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe sphere, the gas inside gets hotter and the pressure increases.
This relationship between temperature and\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume. An\r\n\t\t\t\t\texample of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air\r\n\t\t\t\t\tunder these conditions in the figure below. We find that temperature and pressure are\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlinearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then P and T\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare directly proportional (again, when volume and moles of gas are held\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconstant); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe gas pressure increases by the same factor.

Guillaume Amontons was the first to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tempirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more\r\n\t\t\t\t\tprecisely (~1800). The P-T relationship for gases is more commonly known as\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGay-Lussac's lawpressure of a given number of moles of gas is directly proportional to its kelvin temperature when the volume is held constant.
pressure of a given number of moles of gas is directly proportional to its kelvin temperature when the volume is held constant
Under either name, it states that the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe kelvin scale when the volume is held constant. Mathematically, this can be\r\n\t\t\t\t\twritten:
The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttemperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMathematically, this can be written:
The gas in a sealed can is initially at\r\n\t\t\t\t\t C and 360 kPa, and the can has a volume of 350 mL. If the can is left in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta car that reaches 50 C on a hot day, assuming no change in the volume of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe can, what is the new pressure in the can?
First let's think about the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproblem. Will the pressure increase or decrease? Because the temperature is\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing the pressure will increase as well.
We are looking for a pressure change\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdue to a temperature change at constant volume, so we will use Gay-Lussacs\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlaw.
Identify the variables from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tproblem.
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = 360 kPa
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = 24 C
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = ?
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = 50 C
Next we need to convert the temperature\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalues to kelvin.
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = 360 kPa
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = 24 C  297 K
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = ?
\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tT\r\n\t\t\t\t\t = 50 C  323 K
Now we can plug the values into the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tequation and solve for P\r\n\t\t\t\t\t .
Rearranging the variables to solve for\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP\r\n\t\t\t\t\t gives:
This value matches our original\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tassumption that an increase in the temperature will result in an increase in\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pressure.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,Quantized Energy and the Photoelectric Effect,"One observation that could not be adequately explained by viewing light as waves\n                    is the light emitted as objects are heated. The wavelengths and intensities of the \n                    objects energy distribution can be measured by a spectrometer, and each distribution \n                    depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. As shown in the figure below, \n                    the maxima in these spectral distribution curves, \xce\xbbmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as \n                    the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that as a metal is heated it glows \n                    red, then orange, yellow, and eventually white (as the intensities of all of the visible \n                    wavelengths become appreciable at very high temperatures). This common observation was      \n                    at the heart of the first paradox showing the fundamental limitations of classical physics \n                    that we will examine.
Using the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism, which held that electromagnetic waves \n                    could have any frequency within a continuously varying range, late 19th century scientists derived \n                    mathematical expressions for these energy distributions. These expressions fit the observed experimental \n                    blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths but diverged more and more as the wavelength became shorter,\n                    with the absurd consequence of infinitely large energies as the wavelength approached zero. This became \n                    known as the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"", since it implied that everyday objects at room temperature should \n                    be emitting large amounts of UV light and no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment \n                    that led to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.
Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for this phenomenon that\n                    fit the experimental observations. Planck treated the vibrating atoms as the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation\n                    (a premise from previous work), but instead of allowing the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a\n                    continuous set of energies (as allowed by classical physics, and as previously thought) Planck proposed that the vibrational \n                    energies were restricted to a discrete set of values for each frequency (i.e. that energy was quantized).
$$E\\;=\\;nh\\nu\\;,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;n\\;=\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;...$$
The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck\'s constant, in his honor.\n                    Although it appears that energy is emitted and absorbed continuously and not in\n                    discrete quantities, notice that the value of Planck\'s constant is very small,\n                    6.626 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy\n                    quantization is not observed in macroscopic phenomena.
The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the\n                    photoelectric effect. It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from\n                    the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than a\n                    threshold frequency, unique to the type of metal, was shone on it. Since the electrons in the metal had a\n                    certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed\n                    to have more energy - and therefore a higher frequency - to free the electrons. This is illustrated in the animation\n                    below.
According to classical wave theory, a wave\'s energy depends on its intensity \n                    (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. However, the frequency at which \n                    electrons start to be emitted from the metal (known as the threshold frequency) \n                    does not change when the intensity of the light changes. This is illustrated by comparing \n                    the animation below with the animation above.
Although the threshold frequency doesn\'t change with changes in intensity (brightness) of the light, \n                    once the threshold is met the number of electrons emitted within a given time period (i.e. the electric \n                    current) increases with increasing intensity of the light. This is shown in the following two animations.
Along with the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons also does not depend \n                    on the intensity of the light. However, if the frequency of the light is increased the kinetic energy of \n                    the electrons increases as well. This is shown in the graph below.
Different metals have different threshold frequencies. As we have seen in the\n                    previous animations the wavelength of the frequency threshold for sodium is\n                    approximately 500 nm. As seen in the animation below the wavelength of the\n                    threshold frequency for calcium is approximately 400 nm.
In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck\'s quantization \n                    findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, \n                    and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous). \n                    Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated could be\n                    applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the\n                    metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of\n                    particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency,\n                    according to Planck\'s formula, E = h\xce\xbd (or, in terms of wavelength using c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd,\n                    E = hc/\xce\xbb).
Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency\n                    greater than the threshold). Einstein also argued that the light intensity did\n                    not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to\n                    the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This\n                    explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing\n                    brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the\n                    likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.
With Einstein\'s findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Some\n                    phenomena could be explained by viewing light as a wave and other phenomena,\n                    such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by viewing light as a\n                    particle. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light\n                    is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality.
When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon\n                atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the\n                photon being emitted?
We use the part of Planck\'s equation that includes the wavelength, h\xce\xbd\xce\xbb, and convert\n                units of nanometers to meters so that the units of \xce\xbb correspond to the length units of c.

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Significant Figures,"Counting is a type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number \n            of objects being counted does not change while the counting process is underway. \n            The result of such a counting measurement is an example of an exact number. If we \n            count eggs in a carton, we know exactly how many eggs the carton contains. The \n            numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12 \n            inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram. \n            Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain \n            to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.
The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, \n                are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should \n                make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface \n                of the liquid.
Refer to the illustration in Figure above. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly \n                lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 \n                mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the \n                21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquids volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number \n                21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate \n                the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place \n                digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit \n                to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, \n                given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on \n                this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. \n                The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL.
This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you \n                place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits \n                6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 \n                and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement \n                of  0.01 gram. If we weigh the quarter on a more sensitive balance, we may find that its mass is \n                6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. \n                Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the users ability). \n                All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant \n                    figures(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you \n                stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows ,d then the 1 (hundreds), \n                2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.
(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit
All digits that are part of a measurement are significant digits. However, in some measurements \n                we must include zeros as place holders, it is these zeros that are not significant digits. \n                Let\'s look at an example.
Say that you wanted to record the volume of liquid in the flask pictured above. You can say with \n                certainty that the volume is between 200 and 300 ml and you can make an estimate that the volume \n                is closer to 200 than to 300. Your estimated digit would be in the tens place. Let\'s say you \n                estimate that a 2 should be in the tens place. The 2 in the hundreds place is a certain digit \n                and the 2 in the tens place is your estimated digit. However, you cannot record the volume as \n                22 ml. You would add a zero in the ones place to show the place values of the twos and record \n                the volume as 220 ml. In this example the 0 is not part of the measurement, as it is neither \n                a certain nor estimated digit, it is a placeholder and therefore not a significant digit.
Here we will look at some guidelines to follow in determining whether or not digits in a measurement \n                are significant. All nonzero digits are always significant. The zeros are a little more complex. We \n                will use the terms cleading,d ctrailing,d and ccaptived for the zeros and will consider how to deal \n                with them.
Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This \n                is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the \n                left of where the decimal point would be located.
Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never \n                significantthey merely tell us where the decimal point is located.
The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation and express the \n                number as 8.32407×10-3; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, \n                and 10-3 locates the decimal point.
The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal \n                point location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate \n                where the decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation: \n                1.3×103 (two significant figures), 1.30×103 (three significant figures, if the \n                tens place was measured), or 1.300×103 (four significant figures, if the ones place was \n                also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is available, it is prudent to assume \n                that all trailing zeros are not significant.

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Simple Cubic Unit Cells,"Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids\n            are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of their particles because\n            the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total\n            intermolecular energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient\n            manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level is often reflected at a macroscopic\n            level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of\n            metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined\n            experimentally.
We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids\n             by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple because each contains only\n             one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely\n             together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as\n             their malleability and ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in\n             a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to another partially\n             depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We\n             will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal\n             geometries in the sections that follow.
The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a\n            metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is\n            referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent\n            the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell\n            repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in the figure below.
A unit cell shows the locations of\n                lattice points repeating in all directions.
Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice\n            structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit\n            cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as\n            tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this\n            would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in\n            the layer below, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called simple\n            cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive\n            cubic unit cell.
When metal atoms are arranged with\n                spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the\n                lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in\n                contact.
In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not\n            packed as closely as they could be, and they only cfilld about 52% of the volume of the\n            container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium,\n            Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in the figure below a solid with\n            this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only\n            the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above;\n            and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that\n            each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a\n            polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.
An atom in a simple cubic lattice\n                structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of\n                six.
In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that\n            repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms, as shown\n            below. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge\n            length of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit\n            cell contains only the parts of these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a\n            corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only\n            one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit\n            cell has one atom at each of its eight ccorners,d there is \\(8\\times\\\;=1\\) atom\n            within one simple cubic unit cell.
A simple cubic lattice unit cell\n                contains one-eighth of an atom at each of its eight corners, so it contains one\n                atom total.
The edge length of the unit cell of alpha\n                polonium is 336 pm.
(a) Determine the radius of a polonium atom.
(b) Determine the density of alpha polonium.
Alpha polonium crystallizes in a simple cubic\n                unit cell:
(a) Two adjacent Po atoms contact each other,\n                so the edge length of this cell is equal to two Po atomic radii: l = 2r. Therefore,\n                the radius of Po is:
$$r\\;=\\;\\frac\n                l2=\\frac{336\\;\\mathrm{pm}}2=168\\;\\mathrm{pm}$$
(b) Density is given by \\(\n                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) The density of polonium can be found by\n                determining the density of its unit cell (the mass contained within a unit cell\n                divided by the volume of the unit cell). Since a Po unit cell contains one-eighth of\n                a Po atom at each of its eight corners, a unit cell contains one Po atom.
The mass of a Po unit cell can be found by:
$$1\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{atom}}{1\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}}\\times\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{Po}}{6.022\\;\\times\\;10^{23}\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{atoms}}\\times\\frac{208.998\\;\\mathrm\n                g}{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{Po}}=3.47\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm g\\;$$
The volume of a Po unit cell can be found\n                by:
$$\\mathrm V\\;=\\;\n                l^3\\;=\\;\\left(336\\;\\mathrm{pm}\\times\\frac{10^{-12}\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{10^{-2}\\;\\mathrm{pm}}\\right)^3\\;=\\;3.79\\;\^{-23}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3$$
(Note that the edge length was converted from\n                pm to cm to get the usual volume units for density.)
Therefore, the density of Po is:
$$\\mathrm{density}\\;=\\;\\frac{3.47\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm\n                g}{3.79\\;\^{-23}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3}\\;=9.16\\;\\mathrm g/\\mathrm{cm}^3$$",Solution
Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Vapor Pressure,"We witness and utilize changes of physical state, or phase transitions, in a great number\n            of ways. As one example of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation,\n            freezing, and melting of water. These changes of state are essential aspects of our\n            earths water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and technological processes\n            of central importance to our lives.
When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas\n            phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of\n            the condensed phase, and in some cases, these collisions will result in the molecules\n            re-entering the condensed phase. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate\n            of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the\n            container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the\n            liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually\n            exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a dynamic\n            equilibrium, the status of a system in which reciprocal processes (for example,\n            vaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by the vapor\n            in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the\n            liquids vapor pressure (or equilibrium vapor pressure). We can measure the vapor\n            pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated\n            below, and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the\n            vapor in equilibrium with the condensed phase.
The chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths)\n            of intermolecular attractions possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit\n            different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong intermolecular attractive\n            forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring crecaptured of gas-phase\n            molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor\n            pressure. Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and\n            a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The\n            following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular\n            attractive forces.
Given the shown structural formulas for these four compounds, explain their relative\n                vapor pressures in terms of types and extents of IMFs:
As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to\n                    the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature,\n                    the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic energies, with a\n                    certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and\n                    escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of\n                    molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid. The escape of more\n                    molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that\n                    escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.
When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric\n                    pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid is\n                    the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure\n                    exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open\n                    containers, this pressure is that due to the earths atmosphere. The normal\n                    boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding\n                    pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). Figure shows the variation in vapor\n                    pressure with temperature for several different substances. Considering the\n                    definition of boiling point, these curves may be seen as depicting the\n                    dependence of a liquids boiling point on surrounding pressure.

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Vapor Pressure Lowering,"As described in the unit on liquids and solids, the equilibrium vapor pressure of a\n            liquid is the pressure exerted by its gaseous phase when vaporization and condensation\n            are occurring at equal rates:
Dissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in a lowering of the\n            liquids vapor pressure. This phenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect\n            of added solute molecules on the liquid\'s vaporization and condensation processes. To\n            vaporize, solvent molecules must be present at the surface of the solution. The presence\n            of solute decreases the surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces\n            the rate of solvent vaporization. Since the rate of condensation is unaffected by the\n            presence of solute, the net result is that the vaporization-condensation equilibrium is\n            achieved with fewer solvent molecules in the vapor phase (i.e., at a lower vapor\n            pressure).
The relationship between the vapor pressures of solution components and the\n            concentrations of those components is described by Raoults law.
The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to\n                    the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the\n                    solution.
where PA is the partial pressure exerted by\n                    component A in the solution, PoA\n                    is the vapor pressure of pure A, and XA is\n                    the mole fraction of A in the solution.
In solutions containing nonvolatile solutes (which will always be the case for\n                    our purposes)
Compute the vapor pressure of an ideal solution containing 92.1 g of glycerin,\n                C3H5(OH)3, and 184.4 g of ethanol,\n                C2H5OH, at 40 C. The vapor pressure of pure ethanol is\n                0.178 atm at 40 C. Glycerin is essentially nonvolatile at this temperature.
Since the solvent is the only volatile component of this solution, its vapor pressure\n                may be computed per Raoults law as:
First, calculate the molar amounts of each solution component using the provided mass\n                data.
Next, calculate the mole fraction of the solvent (ethanol) and use Raoults law to\n                compute the solutions vapor pressure.

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,BCC and FCC Unit Cells,"Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of\n            unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells: simple cubic (which we have\n            already seen), body-centered cubic unit cell, and face-centered cubic unit cellall of which are\n            illustrated in the figure below. (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems,\n            some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit\n            cells. We leave the more complicated geometries for later in this module.)
Cubic unit cells of metals show (in the upper\n                figures) the locations of lattice points and (in the lower figures) metal atoms located in the\n                unit cell.
Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a\n            cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the center, as shown in the\n            figure below. This is called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corners of a BCC\n            unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains\n            two atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners (\\(8\\times\\\;=1\\) atom from\n            the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom in this structure touches four atoms in the\n            layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC structure has a\n            coordination number of eight.
In a body-centered cubic structure, atoms in a\n                specific layer do not touch each other. Each atom touches four atoms in the layer above it and\n                four atoms in the layer below it.
Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently\n            packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68% of the total volume. Isomorphous\n            metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature. (Elements or\n            compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous.)
Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead,\n            crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and at\n            the centers of each face, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called a\n            face-centered cubic (FCC) solid. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at\n            each of the eight corners (\\(8\\times\\\;=1\\) atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom\n            on each of the six faces (\\(6\\times\\\;=3\\) atoms from the faces). The atoms at the corners\n            touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of the cube.\n            Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.
A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the\n                corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the faces of its unit cells.
Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely\n            together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume. This structure is also called cubic\n            closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms.\n            Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer\n            below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination\n            number of 12. The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately\n            obvious, but why they are actually the same structure is illustrated below.
A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating\n                layers (ABCABC) of hexagonally arranged atoms. Atoms in a CCP structure have a coordination\n                number of 12 because they contact six atoms in their layer, plus three atoms in the layer above\n                and three atoms in the layer below. By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP\n                structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from\n                layer B across a diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from\n                layer C at the remaining corner. This is the same as a face-centered cubic\n                arrangement.
Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions\n            between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in\n            this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP,\n            which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in the following\n            figure. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second\n            layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact\n            with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP,\n            atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is\n            also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers\n            (i.e., ABABABb\xaf). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two\n            layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type\n            B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABCb\xaf). About twothirds of all metals crystallize\n            in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of 12. Metals that crystallize in an HCP\n            structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a CCP structure\n            include Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt.
In both types of closest packing, atoms are\n                packed as compactly as possible. Hexagonal closest packing consists of two alternating layers\n                (ABABAB). Cubic closest packing consists of three alternating layers\n                (ABCABCABC).
Calcium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure.\n                The edge length of its unit cell is 558.8 pm.
(a) What is the atomic radius of Ca in this structure?
(b) Calculate the density of Ca.
(a) In an FCC structure, Ca atoms contact each other\n                across the diagonal of the face, so the length of the diagonal is equal to four Ca atomic radii\n                (d = 4r).
Two adjacent edges and the diagonal of the face form a\n                right triangle, with the length of each side equal to 558.8 pm and the length of the hypotenuse\n                equal to four Ca atomic radii:
$$\\mathrm a^2+\\mathrm a^2=\\mathrm\n                d^2\\longrightarrow{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2+{(558.5\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2=(4\\mathrm r)^2\\;$$
Solving this gives for a Ca radius.
$$r\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2\\;+\\;{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2\\;}{16}}=197.6\\;\\mathrm{pm}$$
(b) Density is given by \\(\n                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) . The density of calcium can be found by determining the\n                density of its unit cell: for example, the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the\n                volume of the unit cell. A face-centered Ca unit cell has one-eighth of an atom at each of the\n                eight corners (\\(8\\times\\\;=1\\) atom) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces\n                \\(6\\times\\\;=3\\) atoms), for a total of four atoms in the unit cell.
The mass of the unit cell can be found by:
$$1\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}\\;\\times\\frac{4\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{atom}}{1\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}}\\times\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{Ca}}{6.022\\;\\times\\;10^{23}\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{atoms}}\\times\\frac{40.078\\;\\mathrm\n                g}{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm {Ca}}=2.662\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm g$$
The volume of a Ca unit cell can be found by:
$$V\\;=\\;a^3\\;=\\;\\left(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm}\\times\\frac{10^{-10}\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{pm}}\\right)^3\\;=\\;1.745\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3$$
(Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm\n                to get the usual volume units for density.)
Then, the density of Ca is:
$$\\mathrm{density}\\;=\\;\\frac{2.662\\;\\times\\;10^{-22}\\;\\mathrm\n                g}{1.745\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3}\\;=\\;1.53\\;\\mathrm g/\\mathrm{cm}^3\\;$$
In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of\n            three axes (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between them, as illustrated below. The\n            axes are defined as being the lengths between points in the space lattice. Consequently, unit\n            cell axes join points with identical environments.

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Boiling Point Elevation and Freezing Point Depression,"As described previously, the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its\n            vapor pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a\n            solution is lowered due to the presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that\n            the solutions boiling point will subsequently be increased. Compared to pure solvent, a\n            solution, therefore, will require a higher temperature to achieve any given vapor\n            pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere. The increase\n            in boiling point observed when nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, \xceTb, is called boiling point elevation.
Boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the molal concentration of\n                    solute species:
where Kb is the boiling point elevation\n                    constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute species.
Boiling point elevation constants are characteristic properties that depend on the\n            identity of the solvent. Values of Kb for several\n            solvents are listed in the table below.
Solutions freeze at lower temperatures than pure liquids. This phenomenon is exploited in\n            cde-icingd schemes that use salt, calcium chloride, or urea to melt ice on roads and\n            sidewalks, and in the use of ethylene glycol as an cantifreezed in automobile radiators.\n            Seawater freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water, and so the Arctic and\n            Antarctic oceans remain unfrozen even at temperatures below 0 C (as do the body fluids\n            of fish and other cold-blooded sea animals that live in these oceans).
The decrease in freezing point of a dilute solution compared to that of the pure solvent,\n                \xceTf, is called the freezing point depression.
Freezing point depression is directly proportional to the molal concentration of\n                    solute species:
where Kf is the freezing point depression\n                    constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute\n                    species.
Just as for boiling point elevation constants, these are characteristic properties whose\n            values depend on the chemical identity of the solvent. Values of Kf for several solvents are listed below.
The extent to which boiling point is increased and freezing point decrease for a solvent\n            depends on the total number of solute particles present in a given amount of solvent,\n            not on the mass or size or chemical identities of the particles. A 1 m aqueous solution\n            of sucrose (342 g/mol) and a 1 m aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (62 g/mol) will\n            exhibit the same boiling point because each solution has one mole of solute particles\n            (molecules) per kilogram of solvent.
What is the boiling point of a 0.33 m solution of a\n                nonvolatile solute in benzene?
First, calculate the change in boiling point.
Since we know that boiling point increases with the addition of a solute, add the\n                boiling point elevation to the pure solvents boiling point.
Find the boiling point and freezing point of a solution of 92.1 g of iodine,\n                    I2, in 800.0 g of chloroform, CHCl3, assuming that the\n                iodine is nonvolatile and that the solution is ideal. The boiling point of pure\n                chloroform is 61.2 oC.
First we will need to convert mass of I2 to moles in order to determine\n                the molality of the solution.
Calculate the molality of the solution.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in boiling point and molal\n                concentration to determine how much the boiling point changes.
Determine the new boiling point from the boiling point of the pure solvent and the\n                change.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal\n                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.
Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the\n                change.
The colligative effects on vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point\n                    described in the previous section are conveniently summarized by comparing the\n                    phase diagrams for a pure liquid and a solution derived from that liquid. Phase\n                    diagrams for water and an aqueous solution are shown in the diagram below.
The liquid-vapor curve for the solution is located beneath the corresponding\n                    curve for the solvent, depicting the vapor pressure lowering, \xceP, that results\n                    from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute. Consequently, at any given pressure,\n                    the solutions boiling point is observed at a higher temperature than that for\n                    the pure solvent, reflecting the boiling point elevation, \xceTb, associated with\n                    the presence of nonvolatile solute. The solid-liquid curve for the solution is\n                    displaced left of that for the pure solvent, representing the freezing point\n                    depression, \xceTf, that accompanies solution formation. Finally, notice that the\n                    solid-gas curves for the solvent and its solution are identical. This is the\n                    case for many solutions comprising liquid solvents and nonvolatile solutes. Just\n                    as for vaporization, when a solution of this sort is frozen, it is actually just\n                    the solvent molecules that undergo the liquid-to-solid transition, forming pure\n                    solid solvent that excludes solute species. The solid and gaseous phases,\n                    therefore, are composed of solvent only, and so transitions between these phases\n                    are not subject to colligative effects.

Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Physical Processes,"One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical\n            process is known as calorimetryprocess of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat\n            transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated\n            object (calorimeterdevice used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter\n            is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to\n            establish the calorimeters heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach\n            requires the definition of a systemportion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical\n            or physical change) and its surroundingsall matter other than the system being studied (the other components of the measurement\n            apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the\n            system). Knowledge of the heat capacity of the surroundings, and careful measurements of\n            the masses of the system and surroundings and their temperatures before and after the\n            process allows one to calculate the heat transferred as described in this section.
process of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process
device used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process
portion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied
all matter other than the system being studied
A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or\n            physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a\n            calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which\n            increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is\n            absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature. The\n            temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be\n            used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.
Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat\n            between the calorimeter and its environment. This enables the accurate determination of\n            the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General\n            chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups.\n            These easy-to-use ccoffee cupd calorimeters allow more heat exchange with their\n            surroundings, and therefore produce less accurate energy values, but for the purposes of\n            a general chemistry student are accurate enough.
Before we practice calorimetry problems involving chemical reactions, consider a simpler\n            example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry.
Click through the slide show below that describes the general concepts of calorimetry.
If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two\n            substances (in this example the water and the metal), with no heat gained or lost by\n            either the calorimeter or the calorimeters surroundings. Under these ideal\n            circumstances, the net heat change is zero:
This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by the metal is equal to\n            the heat lost the water:
The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the\n            negative sign merely shows that qmetal and qwater are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain\n            or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic sign of either q\n            value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per\n            definition). In the specific situation described, qmetal is a negative value and qwater is positive, since heat is transferred from the metal to the\n            water.
A 248 g piece of copper is dropped into 392 mL of water at 22.6 C in a coffee cup\n                calorimeter. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 C. Calculate\n                the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs\n                between the copper and the water. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g C.
The temperature of the water increases from 22.6 C to 39.9 C, so the water absorbs\n                heat. That heat came from the piece of copper, which initially was at a higher\n                temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the copper and the water,\n                with no heat clostd to the surroundings, then heat given off by the copper = heat\n                taken in by water, or:
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:
Letting f = final and i = initial, in\n                expanded form, this becomes:
The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 392 mL of water = 392 g. Noting that the final\n                temperature of both the copper and water is 39.9 C, substituting known values\n                yields:
Rearranging to solve for Ti,copper:
Solving this gives Ti,copper = 337 C, so the initial temperature of the\n                copper was 337 C.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of\n            an unknown metal.
A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly\n                transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 C in a calorimeter. The final\n                temperature is 28.5 C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal.\n                Use this result to identify the metal.
Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,\n                or:
\n                qmetal = qwater\n
In expanded form, this is:
Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was\n            100.0 C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:
Rearranging the equation to solve for cmetal:
Comparing this with values in the table on page ""Heat Capacity and Specific Heat"" , our\n            experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g C), so we identify the metal as copper.","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to see the example progress."

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Covalent Bond Formation,"In ionic compounds, electrons are transferred between atoms of different elements to form\n            ions. But this is not the only way that compounds can be formed. Atoms can also make\n            chemical bonds by sharing electrons  between each other. Such bonds are called\n            covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar\n            tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or\n            fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen\n            atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the\n            H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same\n            number of valence electrons as the noble gas He
Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic\n            compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is\n            weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have\n            much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent\n            compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are\n            typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good\n            conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble\n            in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity\n            in any state.
Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the\n            hydrogen molecule, H2, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen\n            atoms. The diagram illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we\n            have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the\n            red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms\n            approach each other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to\n            overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic\n            nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared\n            electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the\n            bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive\n            charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases.\n            The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is\n            achieved.
Similar to hydrogen, an oxygen atom will form a covalent bond with another oxygen\n                atom to form and oxygen molecule, O2. In this interactive you will\n                explore the energy associated with the formation of this bond.

1. Click on the radio button for two oxygen atoms.
2. Zoom out on the graph so that the full potential energy graph can be viewed. The\n                graph should look like the image below.
3. Drag the oxygen atom on the right to the right so that it lines up with the right\n                side of the graph.
4. When you let go of the oxygen atom you see that it very slowly begins to move\n                towards the stationary oxygen atom. Continue watching as the two oxygen atoms get\n                closer together.
5. Now drag the oxygen atom on the right that has formed the covalent bond with the\n                oxygen atom of the left further to the left. Observe the graph.
It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an\n            endothermic process), whereas forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic\n            process). In the case of H2, the covalent bond is very strong; a large amount\n            of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules\n            and cause the atoms to separate:
Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2\n            molecules forms from two moles of H atoms:
Repeat steps 1-4 above. Click on the oxygen atom. Drag the atom on the right to the\n                right and observe as the two atoms are drawn together to form a covalent bond and an\n                oxygen molecule.

For example, we might say that a glass of iced tea becomes\n            increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the\n            volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby\n            reducing the relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its\n            taste.
process of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes
Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By\n            adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can\n            achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically\n            sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is\n            appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must\n            be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of\n            common laboratory reagents.
A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations\n            of a solution before and after the dilution process. According to the definition of\n            molarity, the molar amount of solute in a solution is equal to the product of the\n            solutions molarity and its volume in liters:
Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:
where the subscripts d and d refer to the solution before and after the dilution,\n            respectively. Since the dilution process does not change the amount of solute in the\n            solution, n1 = n2. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to\n            one another.
Although we derived this equation using molarity as the unit of concentration and\n                    liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be\n                    used, so long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method.\n                    Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more\n                    general form:
where C and V are concentration\n                    and volume, respectively.
If 0.850 L of a 5.00M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is\n                diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the\n                diluted solution?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and\n                    C1, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, V2.\n                We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, C2. We thus\n                rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate C2:
Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased\n                from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), we would expect the diluted solutions concentration to be\n                less than one-half 5 M. We will compare this ballpark estimate to the calculated\n                result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, an improper\n                substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms\n                on the right side of this equation yields:
This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (its a bit less than one-half the\n                stock concentration, 5 M).
What volume of 0.12 M HBr can be prepared from 11 mL (0.011 L) of 0.45 M HBr?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and\n                    C1, and the concentration of the resultant diluted solution,\n                    C2. We need to find the volume of the diluted solution,\n                V2. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate\n                    V2:
Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the\n                original concentration (0.45 M), we would expect the volume of the diluted solution\n                to be roughly four times the original volume, or around 44 mL. Substituting the\n                given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
The volume of the 0.12 M solution is 0.041 L (41 mL). The result is reasonable and\n                compares well with our rough estimate.
What volume of 1.59 M KOH is required to prepare 5.00 L of 0.100 M KOH?
We are given the concentration of a stock solution, C1, and the volume and\n                concentration of the resultant diluted solution, V2 and C2. We\n                need to find the volume of the stock solution, V1. We thus rearrange the\n                dilution equation in order to isolate V1:
Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that\n                of the stock solution (1.59 M), we would expect the volume of the stock solution to\n                be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters.\n                Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
Thus, we would need 0.314 L of the 1.59 M solution to prepare the desired solution.\n                This result is consistent with our rough estimate.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment,"As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing\n            electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (\xce+) and the other\n            atom with a partial negative charge (\xce), as the electrons are pulled toward the more\n            electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole momentseparation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector. The\n            magnitude of a bond dipole momentproperty of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure is represented by the Greek letter mu () and is given\n            by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined\n            by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:
separation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector
property of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure
This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and\n            magnitude. Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less\n            electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on\n            the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The\n            length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference\n            between the two atoms.
A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular\n            structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the\n            molecule is said to be a polar molecule(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to\n            be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the\n            molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in\n            three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.
(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment
For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the\n            molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and\n                N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is\n            zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF,\n            there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in\n            electronegativity.
When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If\n            the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum\n            equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO2.\n            Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis\n            structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is\n            linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments\n            cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water\n            molecule, the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom,\n            and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero\n            bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone\n            pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net\n            dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).
The OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO2, but a sulfur atom has\n            replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the\n            molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:
The C-O bond is considerably polar. Although C and S have very similar electronegativity\n            values, S is slightly more electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly\n            polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, the oxygen end of the\n            molecule is the negative end. The OCS molecule is polar.
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, is another example of a polar molecule. Although the\n            polar CCl and CH bonds are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry, the CCl bonds have a\n            larger bond moment than the CH bond, and the bond moments do not completely cancel each\n            other. All of the dipoles have a downward component in the orientation shown, since\n            carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and less electronegative than chlorine. The\n                CH3Cl molecule is polar.
When we examine the highly symmetrical molecules BF3 (trigonal planar), CH4\n            (tetrahedral), PF5 (trigonal bipyramidal), and SF6 (octahedral), in which all\n            the polar bonds are identical, the molecules are nonpolar. The bonds in these molecules\n            are arranged such that their dipoles cancel. However, just because a molecule contains\n            identical bonds does not mean that the dipoles will always cancel. Many molecules that\n            have identical bonds and lone pairs on the central atoms have bond dipoles that do not\n            cancel because their molecular shape is not symmetrical. Examples include H2S and NH3. A\n            hydrogen atom is at the positive end and a nitrogen or sulfur atom is at the negative\n            end of the polar bonds in these molecules:
To summarize, to be polar, a molecule must:
Polar molecules tend to align when placed in an electric field with the positive\n                    end of the molecule oriented toward the negative plate and the negative end\n                    toward the positive plate. We can use an electrically charged object to attract\n                    polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents\n                    are better at dissolving polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at\n                    dissolving nonpolar substances.

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Dispersion Forces,"One intermolecular force that is present in all substances, regardless of the\n            nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance, is referred to as a dispersion\n            force. This attractive force is also called the London dispersion force in honor of\n            German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. Because the electrons of an atom or\n            molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electrons location is subject\n            to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can\n            develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed\n            asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a\n            neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly\n            fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction\n            between the speciesa dispersion force like that illustrated below.
Dispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two\n            molecules to each other. The forces are relatively weak, however, can become significant\n            only when the molecules are very close. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit\n            stronger dispersion forces than do smaller and lighter atoms and molecules.\n                F2 and Cl2 are gases at room temperature (reflecting weaker\n            attractive forces); Br2 is a liquid, and I2 is a solid (reflecting\n            stronger attractive forces). Trends in observed melting and boiling points for the\n            halogens clearly demonstrate this effect, as seen in the table below.
The increase in melting and boiling points with increasing atomic/molecular size may be\n            rationalized by considering how the strength of dispersion forces is affected by the\n            electronic structure of the atoms or molecules in the substance. In a larger atom, the\n            valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei than in a smaller atom. Thus,\n            they are less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that produce\n            the attraction. The measure of how easy or difficult it is for another electrostatic\n            charge (for example, a nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecules charge\n            distribution (its electron cloud) is known as polarizability. A molecule that has a\n            charge cloud that is easily distorted is said to be very polarizable and will have large\n            dispersion forces; one with a large cloud that is difficult to distort is not very\n            polarizable and will have small dispersion forces.
Order the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to\n                highest boiling point: CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and\n                    SnH4. Explain your reasoning.
All of these compounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may\n                experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the molecule, the less polarizable\n                and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the\n                dispersion forces. The molar masses of CH4, SiH4,\n                    GeH4, and SnH4 are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol, 77 g/mol, and\n                123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH4 is expected to have the lowest\n                boiling point and SnH4 the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to\n                highest boiling point is expected to be CH4 < SiH4 <\n                    GeH4 < SnH4.
A graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the\n                group 14 element shows this prediction to be correct:
The shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces\n                    between them. For example, boiling points for the isomers n-pentane, isopentane,\n                    and neopentane (shown below) are 36 C, 27 C, and 9.5 C, respectively. Even\n                    though these compounds are composed of molecules with the same chemical formula,\n                        C5H12, the difference in boiling points suggests that\n                    dispersion forces in the liquid phase are different, being greatest for\n                    n-pentane and least for neopentane. The elongated shape of n-pentane provides a\n                    greater surface area available for contact between molecules, resulting in\n                    correspondingly stronger dispersion forces. The more compact shape of isopentane\n                    offers a smaller surface area available for intermolecular contact and,\n                    therefore, weaker dispersion forces. Neopentane molecules are the most compact\n                    of the three, offering the least available surface area for intermolecular\n                    contact and, hence, the weakest dispersion forces. This behavior is analogous to\n                    the connections that may be formed between strips of VELCRO brand fasteners: the\n                    greater the area of the strips contact, the stronger the connection.

Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,The Nuclear Atom,"The next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a\n            physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and\n            England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively\n            charged alpha particlespositively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons (\xce particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of\n            radium; \xce particles consist of two protons and two neutrons. Rutherford and his\n            colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a\n            beam of \xce particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of\n            the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering\n            of the \xce particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an \xce\n            particle.
positively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons
What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being\n            deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were\n            deflected almost straight back toward the source.
Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving \xce particles passed\n            through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty\n            space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when\n            they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like\n            charges repel one another, the few positively charged \xce particles that changed paths\n            abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly\n            concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the\n            time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing\n            a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:
This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very\n            small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is\n            concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the atom is\n            electrically neutral. He named this fundamental particle the protonPositively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom., the positively\n            charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will\n            learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used\n            today.

The image in the activity below represents a close-up diagram of Rutherford\'s gold\n                foil experiment. Drag the description of the observation that Rutherford made to the\n                place on the diagram that represents that observation.
One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom,\n            with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different\n            proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the\n            existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged\n            particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found\n            evidence of neutronsuncharged, subatomic particle located in the nucleus, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same\n            as that of protons.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Formal Charge and Molecular Structure,"On the previous page, we looked at three different ways to write the Lewis structure for\n            the thiocyanate ion (SCN-).
All three structures follow the general rules that we discussed previously. So which\n            structure is correct? Here we will look at how to use the formal charges that we\n            calculated for each structure to decide which structure is most correct.
The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many\n            cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one\n            possible molecular structuredifferent multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements\n            or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal\n            charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a\n            particular molecule or ion:
Let\'s apply these guidelines to our three structures for thiocyanate.
Note that the sum of the formal charges in each case is equal to the charge of the ion\n            (). However, the first arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest\n            number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline 2). Also, it places the least\n            electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative\n            element (Guideline 3).
Let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know from our\n            previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central\n            position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three\n            possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the\n            center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:
Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the\n            left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).
Nitrous oxide, N2O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor\n                surgeries, such as the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely\n                structure for nitrous oxide?
Determining formal charge yields the following:
The structure with a terminal oxygen atom best satisfies the criteria for the most\n                stable distribution of formal charge:
The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no\n                formal charge larger than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the\n                preference for having the less electronegative atom in the central position.

Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Hess\'s Law,"There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure\n            it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy\n            changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make\n            accurate measurements difficult to carry out experimentally. And even when a reaction is\n            not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat\n            involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.
Hesss law allows us to relate the enthalpies of different reactions.
If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the\n                    enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of\n                    the various steps.
Hesss law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only\n            on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to\n            finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon\n            dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is\n            written:
We can also consider a two-step process, where first carbon monoxide is formed in the\n            first step:
In the second step, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical\n            changes:
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:
According to Hesss law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the\n            enthalpy changes of the steps. Because, in this case, the first two steps are combustion\n            reactions, we can use the enthalpies of combustion found on the table on page:\n                Enthalpies of\n                Combustion to find the enthalpy change of the entire reaction from\n            its two steps:
The result is shown in the diagram below. We see that \xceH of the\n            overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall\n                \xceH for the reaction = sum of \xceH\n            values for reaction cstepsd in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and\n            physical processes.
Before we further practice using Hesss law, let us recall two important features of \xceH.
\xceH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or\n            products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of\n                NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ :
When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the \xceH\n            will be twice as large:
In general, if we multiply (or divide) an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change\n            should also be multiplied (or divided) by the same number.
\xceH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and\n            opposite in sign to \xceH for the reaction in the reverse\n            direction. For example, given that:
Then, for the creversed reaction, the enthalpy change is also creversedd:
Determine the enthalpy of formation, \xceHf of\n                    FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process\n                that occurs under standard state conditions:
We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s),\n                which is equal to \xceH for the reaction:
Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find \xceH is the sum of the two reactions with known \xceH values, so we must sum their \xceHs:
The enthalpy of formation, \xceHf, of\n                    FeCl3(s) is .5 kJ/mol.
Many times the given steps do not add up to the equation in question and some\n            manipulation of the equations is required. Here we will look at some such examples.
Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:
Use the reactions here to determine the \xceH for reaction (i):
Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they\n                add up to reaction (i). Going from left to right in (i), we first see that ClF(g) is\n                needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (iii) by 1/2,\n                which means that the \xceH change is also multiplied by 1/2:
Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse\n                and halve reaction (ii), which means that the \xceH changes sign and is halved:
To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of \xceH:
Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Introduction to the Periodic Table,"As early chemists worked to purify ores and discovered more elements, they realized that\n            various elements could be grouped together by their similar chemical behaviors. One such\n            grouping includes:
These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar\n            chemical properties.
A second grouping includes:
which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical\n            properties in common.
However, the specific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each\n            other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li,\n            Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen\n            atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen\n            atom.
Other elements that exhibit similar properties to each other are:
but the properties of this group of elements are drastically different from those of any\n            of the groups of elements above.
Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently\n            recognized that there was a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements\n            known at that time. Both published tables with the elements arranged according to\n            increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his\n            table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to\n            aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and\n            germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleevs work. Although Mendeleev and\n            Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleevs contributions to the development of\n            the periodic table are now more widely recognized.
By the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved\n            atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the\n            periodic law, is as follows: the properties of the elements are periodic functions of\n            their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the elements in increasing order\n            of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical\n            column. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called periods or series,\n            and 18 vertical columns, called groups. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In\n            the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However,\n            IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more\n            common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14\n            columns, are usually written below the main body of the table.
You will be using the periodic table frequently throughout this course. For your\n                    convenience a link to the periodic table will be at the beginning of every\n                    module, starting with the next one. The periodic table from this link will open\n                    in a separate tab. It may be a good idea to open it at the beginning of the\n                    module, as you will likely need it throughout any given module. All calculations\n                    within this course that use atomic masses as they appear on this periodic table, most of which are rounded\n                    to the hundredths place. There are many sources of periodic tables online or you\n                    may want to have a paper copy with which to work. Use whatever works best for\n                    you.
Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some\n            elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are\n            malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires),\n            and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or\n            ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into\n            large classes with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good\n            conductors of heat and electricityshaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull,\n            poor conductors of heat and electricityshaded green); and metalloids (elements that\n            conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and\n            some properties of nonmetalsshaded purple).
The elements can also be classified into the main-group elements (or representative\n            elements) in the columns labeled 1, 2, and 13; the transition metals in the columns\n            labeled 3; and inner transition metals in the two rows at the bottom of the table\n            (the top-row elements are called lanthanides and the bottom-row elements are actinides.\n            The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the\n            composition of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first\n            column) form compounds that consist of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen.\n            These elements (except hydrogen) are known as alkali metals, and they all have similar\n            chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds\n            consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called\n            alkaline earth metals, with similar properties among members of that group. Other groups\n            with specific names are the pnictogens (group 15), chalcogens (group 16), halogens\n            (group 17), and the noble gases (group 18, also known as inert gases). The groups can\n            also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can\n            be called the oxygen group or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element\n            with properties similar to both group 1 and group 17 elements. For that reason, hydrogen\n            may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Ionization Energies,"The amount of energy required to remove the most\r\n\t\t\tloosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state is called its first\r\n\t\t\tionization energy (IE1 ). The first ionization energy for an element, X, is\r\n\t\t\tthe energy required to form a cation with +1 charge:
\r\n\t\t\t$$X(g) \\rightarrow X^{+} + e^{-} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{IE}_1$$\r\n\t\t
The energy required to remove the second most\r\n\t\t\tloosely bound electron is called the second ionization energy (IE 2 ).
\r\n\t\t\t$$X^{+}(g) \\rightarrow X^{2+}(g) + e^{-} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{IE}_2$$\r\n\t\t
The energy required to remove the third electron is\r\n\t\t\tthe third ionization energy, and so on. Energy is always required to remove electrons\r\n\t\t\tfrom atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are always\r\n\t\t\tpositive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the\r\n\t\t\tnucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, the\r\n\t\t\tionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned\r\n\t\t\tabout radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to\r\n\t\t\tincrease across a period.
The graph below shows the relationship between the\r\n\t\t\tfirst ionization energy and the atomic number of several elements. The values of first\r\n\t\t\tionization energy for the elements are given in periodic table below the graph. Within a\r\n\t\t\tperiod, the IE1 generally increases with increasing Z. Down a group, the IE\r\n\t\t value generally decreases with increasing Z. There are some systematic\r\n\t\t\tdeviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic\r\n\t\t\tnumber 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear\r\n\t\t\tcharge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of\r\n\t\t\tthe subshells increases as oneincreases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed\r\n\t\t\tpreviously). Within any one shell, the s electrons are lower in energy than the p\r\n\t\t\telectrons. This means that an s electron is harder to remove from an atom than a p\r\n\t\t\telectron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium\r\n\t\t\t([He]2s2 ) is an s electron, whereas the electron removed during the\r\n\t\t\tionization of boron ([He]2s22p 1) is a p electron; this results\r\n\t\t\tin a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater\r\n\t\t\tby one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each\r\n\t\t\ttime a new subshell begins.
Another deviation occurs as orbitals become more\r\n\t\t\tthan one-half filled. The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that\r\n\t\t\tfor nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing IE1 values across a period.\r\n\t\t\tLooking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will\r\n\t\t\teliminate the electronelectron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the 2p\r\n\t\t\torbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable).\r\n\t\t\tAnalogous changes occur in succeeding periods.
Removing an electron from a cation is more\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater\r\n\t\t\t\t\telectrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one\r\n\t\t\t\t\telement always increase. As seen in Table below, there is a large increase in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tremoval of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence\r\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the\r\n\t\t\t\t\trapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,Line Spectra,"Another paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late\n            nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules.\n            When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of\n            the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies,\n            and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is\n            present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this\n            fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a\n            prism to separate them. As can be seen in figure below, sunlight also contains UV light\n            (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using\n            instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such\n            as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all\n            wavelengths of visible light.
In contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra\n            having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as\n            those shown in the figure below. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an\n            electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs\n            and neon signs operate in this way. Each element displays its own characteristic set of\n            lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.
Each emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light\n            emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric\n            discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the\n                H2 molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a\n            blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating\n            that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in the\n            figure below.
Every element has a unique line spectrum, which can be used to identify the element. The\n            image below shows the line spectra of several elements. Compounds also produce unique\n            line spectra, but are more complex than the spectra produced by individual elements.
This video shows the line\n            spectra of several different substances. Note that the diffraction grating used works\n            like a prism to bend and separate the light so that each individual frequencies can be\n            seen.
The origin of discrete spectra in atoms and molecules was extremely puzzling to\n            scientists in the late nineteenth century, since according to classical electromagnetic\n            theory, only continuous spectra should be observed. Even more puzzling, in 1885, Johann\n            Balmer was able to derive an empirical equation that related the four visible\n            wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen atoms to whole integers. That equation is the\n            following one, in which k is a constant:
Other discrete lines for the hydrogen atom were found in the UV and IR regions. Johannes\n            Rydberg generalized Balmer\'s work and developed an empirical formula that predicted all\n            of hydrogen\'s emission lines, not just those restricted to the visible range, where\n            n1 and n2 are integers, n1 < n2 and\n            RH is the Rydberg constant (1.097 m-1).
Even in the late nineteenth century, spectroscopy was a very precise science, and so the\n            wavelengths of hydrogen were measured to very high accuracy, which implied that the\n            Rydberg constant could be determined very precisely as well. That such a simple formula\n            as the Rydberg formula could account for such precise measurements seemed astounding at\n            the time, but it was the eventual explanation for emission spectra by Neils Bohr in 1913\n            that ultimately convinced scientists to abandon classical physics and spurred the\n            development of modern quantum mechanics.

Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Non-Ideal Gas Behavior,"Thus far, the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, has been\r\n\t\t\tapplied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from reaction stoichiometry\r\n\t\t\tand empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass\r\n\t\t\tof a gas. As mentioned previously, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal,\r\n\t\t\tmeaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature\r\n\t\t\tare not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these\r\n\t\t\tdeviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.
The KMT assumes that the volume of gas particles is\r\n\t\t\tzero. This assumption can be made because the volume of the individual gas particles is\r\n\t\t\tnegligible compared to the volume of the container that the gas is in. Observe in the\r\n\t\t\tanimation below that as the pressure of the gas increases the volume of the gas\r\n\t\t\tparticles will take up a larger percentage of the container. Therefore as pressure\r\n\t\t\tincreases, gases become less ideal. Gas volumes predicted by the ideal gas equation will\r\n\t\t\tbe slightly larger than the actual volume. As pressure increases this difference will\r\n\t\t\tbecome greater. The difference becomes very significant at 10 atm.
Animation developed from PhET Interactive\r\n\t\t\tSimulations, University of Colorado Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu\r\n\t\t
The graph below shows the measured values of PV/RT\r\n\t\t\tfor 1 mole of several different gases at 300 K and varying pressures. Note that the\r\n\t\t\thorizontal line at 1.0 represents the value that would be calculated for PV/RT for each\r\n\t\t\tof the given gases. As the pressure increases, generally speaking, the difference\r\n\t\t\tbetween the measured value and the value calculated by the ideal gas law increases.
A graph of the compressibility factor (Z)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbehavior predicted by the ideal gas law.
The KMT also assumes that there are no attractive\r\n\t\t\tforces between particles. Like the assumption about volume, under certain conditions\r\n\t\t\tthis is for practical purposes true. At higher temperatures the attractive forces\r\n\t\t\tbetween the gas particles is negligible and can be ignored. However, when a gas is\r\n\t\t\tcooled the particles begin to move more slowly. As the particles are moving more slowly,\r\n\t\t\tthese attractive forces become more significant. Eventually at some temperature\r\n\t\t\t(depending on the gas) the attractive forces will become so significant that the gas\r\n\t\t\twill condense to a liquid.
As temperature decreases the gas particles\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmove more slowly. As the particles move more slowly, attractive forces between\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe particles become more significant. Eventually, if the gas is cooled enough\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe attractive forces will become so significant and cause the gas to condense\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinto a liquid.

(a) Attractions between gas molecules\r\n\t\t\t\t\tserve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure compared to an ideal gas\r\n\t\t\t\t\twhose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forces\r\n\t\t\t\t\twill decrease the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls,\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttherefore reducing the pressure exerted compared to an ideal gas.

Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Partial Pressure of Gases,"Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases\n            do not affect each others pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same\n            pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container. The pressure\n            exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressurepressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture. This\n            observation is summarized by Daltons law of partial pressures.
pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture
The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial\n                pressures of the component gases:
$$P_{Total} = P_A + P_B + P_C + ... = \\Sigma_iP_i $$
In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases,\n                    PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial\n                pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its\n            mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component\n            of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:
$$P_A = X_A \\times P_{Total} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{where}\\ X_A =\n                \\frac{n_A}{n_{Total}}$$
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole\n            fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the\n            number of moles of all components in the mixture.
A 10.0L vessel contains 2.50 -3 mol of H2, 1.00 -3 mol\n                of He, and 3.00 -4 mol of Ne at 35 C.
(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?
(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?
The gases behave independently, so the partial pressure of each gas can be determined\n                from the ideal gas equation, using:
$$P = \\frac{nRT}V.$$
$$\\require{cancel} P_{H_2} = \\frac{(2.50 \\times 10^{-3}\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-3}\n                    \\mathrm{atm}$$
$$\\require{cancel} P_{H_e} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 2.53 \\times 10^{-3}\n                    \\mathrm{atm}$$
$$\\require{cancel} P_{N_e} = \\frac{(3.00 \\times 10^{-4}\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308\n                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 7.58 \\times 10^{-4}\n                    \\mathrm{atm}$$
The total pressure is given by the sum of the partial pressures:
$$P_T = P_{H_2} + P_{H_e} + P_{N_e} = (0.00632 + 0.00253 + 0.00076)\n                    \\mathrm{atm} = 9.61 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{atm}$$
Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.
A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41\n                mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.
(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?
(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?
The mole fraction is given by XA = nA/nTotal and the\n                partial pressure is PA = XA  PTotal.
For O2,
$$X_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{2.83 \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41)\n                    \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.252$$
and
$$P_{O_2} = X_{O_2} \\times P_{Total} = 0.252 \\times 192 \\mathrm{kPa} = 48.4\n                    \\mathrm{kPa}$$
For N2O,
$$X_{N_2O} = \\frac{n_{N_2O}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{8.41\n                    \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41) \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.748$$
and
$$P_{N_2O} = X_{N_2O} \\times P_{Total} = 0.748 \\times 192 \\mathrm{kPa} =\n                    143.6 \\mathrm{kPa}$$

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Percent Yield,"The amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as\n            calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriately balanced chemical equation, is\n            called the theoretical yieldamount of product that may be produced from a given amount of reactant(s) according to the reaction stoichiometry of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product\n            obtained is called the actual yieldamount of product formed in a reaction, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for\n            a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by\n            side reactions that generate other products. Some products are difficult to collect\n            without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The\n            extent to which a reactions theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its\n            percent yieldmeasure of the efficiency of a reaction, expressed as a percentage of the theoretical yield.

Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Phase Diagrams,"On the previous page, the variation of a liquids equilibrium vapor pressure with\n            temperature was described. Considering the definition of boiling point, plots of vapor\n            pressure versus temperature represent how the boiling point of the liquid varies with\n            pressure. Also described was the use of heating and cooling curves to determine a\n            substances melting (or freezing) point. Making such measurements over a wide range of\n            pressures yields data that may be presented graphically as a phase diagram. A phase\n            diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the liquid-gas, solid-liquid,\n            and solid-gas phase-transition equilibria of a substance. These diagrams indicate the\n            physical states that exist under specific conditions of pressure and temperature, and\n            also provide the pressure dependence of the phase-transition temperatures (melting\n            points, sublimation points, boiling points). A typical phase diagram for a pure\n            substance is shown below.
To illustrate the utility of these plots, consider the phase diagram for water shown\n            below. Click through each of the green dots to get more information.
We can use the phase diagram to identify the physical state of a sample of water under\n            specified conditions of pressure and temperature. For example, a pressure of 50 kPa and\n            a temperature of  C correspond to the region of the diagram labeled cice.d Under\n            these conditions, water exists only as a solid (ice). A pressure of 50 kPa and a\n            temperature of 50 C correspond to the cwaterd regionhere, water exists only as a\n            liquid. At 25 kPa and 200 C, water exists only in the gaseous state. Note that on the\n                H2O phase diagram, the pressure and temperature axes are not drawn to a\n            constant scale in order to permit the illustration of several important features as\n            described here.
Consider the phase diagram for carbon dioxide shown below as another example. The\n            solid-liquid curve exhibits a positive slope, indicating that the melting point for CO2\n            increases with pressure as it does for most substances. Notice that the triple point is well above 1 atm, indicating\n            that carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid under ambient pressure conditions. Instead,\n            cooling gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm results in its deposition into the solid state.\n            Likewise, solid carbon dioxide does not melt at 1 atm pressure but instead sublimes to\n            yield gaseous CO2. Finally, notice that the critical point for carbon dioxide is\n            observed at a relatively modest temperature and pressure in comparison to water.
If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 C, remove the air, and let the\n                    vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of\n                    liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the\n                    more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the\n                    temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas\n                    curve in the phase diagram for water, and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and\n                    gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218\n                    atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the\n                    boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now\n                    present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of\n                    the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and\n                    the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point\n                    . Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much\n                    pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature\n                    is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of\n                    some common substances are given in the table below.

Reactions and Stoichiometry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemical Reactions and Equations,Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules,"Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these\n            interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange\n            information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or\n            feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between\n            chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to\n            classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module\n            will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions:\n            precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.
A precipitation reactionreaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more)\n            solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic\n            compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement,\n            double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and\n            are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in\n            animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and\n            specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical\n            analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric\n            methods for determining the composition of matter. Watch the video below to see an example of a precipitation reaction.
reaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is\n            quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a\n            substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively\n            large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution\n            conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with\n            relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that\n            readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is\n            provided later in this course. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids\n            formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that\n            have been observed for many ionic compounds. Note that these guidelines are not\n            comprehensive, they do not cover every possible combination of cations and anions. It is\n            a good idea to memorize these guidelines.
Determine the solubility of the following compounds:
a) AgNO3
b) BaSO4
c) CaCO3
a) Nitrates are always soluble.
b) While sulfate compounds are often soluble, exceptions include: Ag+,\n                    Hg22+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Sr2+,\n                    Ba2+
c) Carbonate compounds are insoluble unless combined with a cation that is always\n                soluble.
We use these solubility rules to predict whether or not a precipitation reaction will\n            occur between two ionic compounds. A vivid example of precipitation is observed when\n            solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of\n            solid lead(II) iodide:
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble\n            compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general\n            solubility of iodide salts.
The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:
Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artists pigment known\n            as iodine yellow. The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for\n            fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
In order to determine whether or not a precipitation reaction will occur one needs to\n            identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion\n            pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver\n            nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing Ag+,\n                NO3, Na+, and F ions. Aside from the\n            two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two\n            additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3\n            and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgF\n            is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation\n            reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic\n                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the\n                reaction.
potassium sulfate and barium nitrate
K+, SO42, Ba2+,\n                        NO3
KNO3 and BaSO4
If any of the possible products are insoluble a precipitate will form.
This reaction will form a precipitate of BaSO4. Therefore, the net ionic\n                equation is:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic\n                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the\n                reaction.
sodium carbonate and ammonium nitrate
Na+, CO32, NH4+,\n                        NO3
NaNO3 and (NH4)2CO3
If all possible products are soluble, no reaction occurs.
The ions present in the reactants will remain unchanged when these two aqueous\n                solutions are combined. No reaction will occur.

Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Pressure-Volume Work,"A type of work called pressure-volume work occurs when a system pushes back the\n            surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the\n            system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine.\n            The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as\n            heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder.
The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of\n            the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing\n            work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep\n            the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine\n            is running.)
The work done on the surroundings by the system or on the system by the surroundings can\n            be calculated with the following equation:
Where \n                \n                    Δ\n                    V\n                     \n                    =\n                     \n                    \n                        V\n                        final\n                    \n                     \n                    −\n                     \n                    \n                        V\n                        initial\n                    \n                \n            \n
The negative sign in the above equation is present because when the gas expands (when\n                    \xceV\n                is positive), the system does work on the surroundings (w\n                is negative).\n
Since we know we can calculate E\n                    using
If the work done on the system or by the system in a given process is pressure-volume\n                    work then:",
Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Significant Figures in Calculations,"A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement\n            are at least as uncertain as the measurement itself. We must take the uncertainty in our\n            measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated\n            results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct\n            number of significant figures, which is determined by the following four rules for\n            rounding numbers:
When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same\n                            number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal\n                            places (i.e., the least certain value in terms of addition and\n                            subtraction).
Add 1.0023 g and 4.383 g.
The answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is 5.385 g (round to\n                the thousandths place; three decimal places)
Subtract 421.23 g from 486 g.
The answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is is 65 g (round to\n                the ones place; no decimal places)
When we multiply or divide numbers, we should round the result to the\n                            same number of digits as the number with the least number of significant\n                            figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and\n                            division).
Multiply 0.6238 cm and 6.60 cm.
When these values are multiplied, we get 4.11708 cm2. The least certain\n                measurement has 3 significant figures. The final answer should be rounded to three\n                significant figures. The final answer rounded to the correct number of significant\n                figures is 4.12 cm2.
Divide 421.23 g by 48 mL.
When these values are divided we get 8.775625 g/mL. The least certain measurement has\n                2 significant figures. The final answer should be rounded to two significant\n                figures. The final answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is\n                8.8 g/mL.
In the midst of all these technicalities, it is important to keep in mind the reason why\n            we use significant figures and rounding rulesto correctly represent the uncertainty of\n            the values we report and to ensure that a calculated result is not represented as being\n            more certain than the least certain value used in the calculation.

Solutions,Solubility,Solubility,"Imagine adding a small amount of salt to a glass of water, stirring until all the salt\n            has dissolved, and then adding a bit more. You can repeat this process until the salt\n            concentration of the solution reaches its natural limit, a limit determined primarily by\n            the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent\n            attractive forces. You can be certain that you have reached this limit because, no\n            matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved salt remains. The concentration of\n            salt in the solution at this point is known as its solubility.
The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may\n            be achieved under given conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium.\n            Referring to the example of salt in water:
When a solutes concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be\n            saturated with that solute. If the solutes concentration is less than its solubility,\n            the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that contains a relatively low\n            concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration\n            is called concentrated.
If we add more salt to a saturated solution of salt, we see it fall to the bottom and no\n            more seems to dissolve. In fact, the added salt does dissolve, as represented by the\n            forward direction of the dissolution equation. Accompanying this process, dissolved salt\n            will precipitate, as depicted by the reverse direction of the equation. The system is\n            said to be at equilibrium when these two reciprocal processes are occurring at equal\n            rates, and so the amount of undissolved and dissolved salt remains constant.
Solutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such\n            solutions are said to be supersaturated, and they are interesting examples of\n            nonequilibrium states. For example, the carbonated beverage in an open container that\n            has not yet cgone flatd is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO2\n            concentration will decrease until it reaches its equilibrium value. A video showing the crystallization of \n            two supersaturated solutions of sodium acetate is shown below.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,The Spin Quantum Number,"The other three quantum numbers, n, l,\n            and ml, are properties of specific atomic orbitals\n            that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located.\n            Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrdinger equation for electrons in atoms. The\n            electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon\n            with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving\n            the Schrdinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as\n            the Cartesian x, y, and z). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron crotationd or\n            cspinning.d Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an\n            angular momentum, even though this rotation cannot be observed in terms of the spatial\n            coordinates.
The magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can\n            only cspind in one of two quantized states. One is termed the \xce state, with the z\n            component of the spin being in the positive direction of the z axis. This corresponds to\n            the spin quantum number ms = \\(\\\). The other is called\n            the \xce state, with the z component of the spin being negative and ms = \\(\\\). Any electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is\n            located in, can only have one of those two values of the spin quantum number. The\n            energies of electrons having ms = \\(\\\) and ms = \\(\\\) are different if an external magnetic field\n            is applied.
The image below illustrates this phenomenon. An electron acts like a tiny magnet. Its\n            moment is directed up (in the positive direction of the z axis)\n            for the \\(\\\) spin quantum number and down (in the negative z\n            direction) for the spin quantum number of \\(\\\). A magnet has a lower energy if its\n            magnetic moment is aligned with the external magnetic field (the left electron on the\n            image below) and a higher energy for the magnetic moment being opposite to the applied\n            field. This is why an electron with ms = \\(\\\) has a\n            slightly lower energy in an external field in the positive z direction, and an electron\n            with ms = \\(\\\) has a slightly higher energy in the\n            same field. This is true even for an electron occupying the same orbital in an atom. A\n            spectral line corresponding to a transition for electrons from the same orbital but with\n            z different spin quantum numbers has two possible values of energy; thus, the line in\n            the spectrum will show a fine structure splitting.
An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l,\n                        ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the\n                    orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property\n                    called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle\n                    that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general\n                    behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated\n                    as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of\n                    all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the\n                    same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but\n                    only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values. Since\n                    the spin quantum number can only have two values (\\(\\\)), no more than two\n                    electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the\n                    same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can\n                    be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.

Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter ,Module Summary and Quiz,"Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building \n                    block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter \n                    into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances, \n                    atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three \n                    states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but \n                    fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature \n                    conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is \n                    composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts \n                    and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in composition \n                    from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to \n                    point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be \n                    an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by \n                    a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms.
\n                    \n                    All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo \n                    physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, \n                    and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the \n                    composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and \n                    chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from \n                    that present beforehand.
Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the Properties of Matter module and use the\n                    My Response link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can\n                    be for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation\n                    and questions may also shape the discussions in class.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a\n                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three\n                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2\n                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these\n                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to\n                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the\n                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp\n                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals\n                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important\n                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number\n                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold\n                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from\n                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now\n                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous\n                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with\n                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical \xcf bonds.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded\n                    Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram. These diagrams represent each\n                    orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an\n                    arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow\n                    to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate\n                    two electrons of opposite spin.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created\n                    orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets\n                    one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired\n                    electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap\n                    during the formation of the BeCl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a\n                    molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom\n                    in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in\n                        Zn(CH3)2, which contains a linear CZnC arrangement,\n                    and the carbon atom in CO2.
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron\n                    density consist of a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one\n                    unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2\n                    hybridization, the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three\n                    identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry.
Although quantum mechanics yields the cplumpd orbital lobes as depicted,\n                    sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor\n                    lobes, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use\n                    these cthinnerd representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily\n                    visualize.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests\n                        sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is\n                    trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen\n                    atoms. We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in\n                    an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH3 as shown in the\n                    orbital energy level diagram. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the\n                    boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron\n                    pairs with a hydrogen electron when BH bonds form.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit\n                        sp2 hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on\n                    the central atom, such as ClNO, or molecules with two single bonds and a double\n                    bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O.
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of\n                    bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four sp3 hybrid\n                    orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p\n                    orbitals that produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each of\n                    these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by\n                    four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane\n                    exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron\n                    distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in\n                    CH4. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed\n                    equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen\n                    electron when the CH bonds form.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps\n                    with one of the four sp3 orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma\n                    (\xcf) bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent\n                    bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the\n                    methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of\n                    methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the\n                    corners of a tetrahedronthree hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. However, in\n                    ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an\n                        sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form a \xcf bond between the\n                    two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps\n                    with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen \xcf bonds. The\n                    structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane. The orientation\n                    of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other.\n                    Experimental evidence shows that rotation around \xcf bonds occurs easily.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For\n                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a\n                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The\n                    nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by\n                    the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of\n                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen\n                    atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by\n                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than\n                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly\n                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5, but the\n                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3) and water (104.5) are slightly smaller.\n                    Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,\n                        PCl3, and NCl3.
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we\n                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p\n                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid\n                    orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six\n                    valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of\n                    the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six\n                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only\n                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not\n                    those in the first or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five PCl\n                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed\n                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p\n                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d\n                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the PCl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit\n                        sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and\n                    the chlorine atoms in ClF3 and in ClF4+. (The\n                    electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2\n                    hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of\n                    electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no\n                    lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s\n                    orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals form six equivalent\n                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a\n                    different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit\n                        sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in\n                        PCl6, the iodine atom in the interhalogens\n                        IF6+, IF5, ICl4,\n                        IF4 and the xenon atom in XeF4.
Ammonium sulfate is important as a fertilizer. What is the hybridization of\n                        the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion, SO42?
The Lewis structure of sulfate shows there are four regions of electron\n                        density. The hybridization is sp3.

Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Volume and Temperature,"If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount\n                    of air at atmospheric pressure, lets say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a\n                    refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both\n                    the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very\n                    cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.
These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a\n                    confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as\n                    the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.\n                    Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed\n                    and graphed.
The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at\n                    constant pressure is known as Charless law in recognition of the French\n                    scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre Csar Charles.
Charless law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly\n                            proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is\n                            held constant.
Mathematically, this can be written as:
*Note that temperatures must be in units of kelvin for any gas law\n                            calculation.
A sample of carbon dioxide, CO2, occupies 0.300 L at 10.0 C and 750 torr.\n                What volume will the gas have at 30.0 C and 750 torr?
Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at\n                constant pressure, this is a job for Charless law.
Identify the variables in the problem.
$$\\begin{array}{l}V_1\\;=\\;0.300\\;\\mathrm L\\;\\;\\;\\\\\;=\\;10.0\\;^\\circ\\mathrm\n                C\\;\\;\\\\\;=\\;?\\;\\;\\\\\;=\\;30.0\\;^\\circ\\mathrm C\\end{array}$$
Next we need to convert temperatures to kelvin.

Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Clausius-Clapeyron Equation,"The quantitative relation between a substances\n            vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
$$P\\;=\\;Ae^{-\\Delta H_{vap}/RT}$$
where \xceHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization for the\n            liquid, R is the gas constant, and A is a constant whose value depends on the chemical\n            identity of the substance. Temperature T must be in Kelvin in this equation. This\n            equation is often rearranged into logarithmic form to yield the linear equation:
$$\\ln\\;P\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta\n            H_{vap}}{RT}+\\;\\ln\\;A$$
This linear equation may be expressed in a\n            two-point format that is convenient for use in various computations, as demonstrated in\n            the example exercises that follow. If at temperature T1, the vapor pressure\n            is P1, and at temperature T2, the vapor pressure is P2,\n            the corresponding linear equations are:
$$\\ln\\;P_1\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta\n            H_{vap}}{RT_1}+\\;\\ln\\;A\\; \\text{and} \\;\\ln\\;P_2\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta\n            H_{vap}}{RT_2}+\\;\\ln\\;A$$
Since the constant, A, is the same, these two\n            equations may be rearranged to isolate ln A and then set them equal to one another:
$$\\ln\\;P_1\\;\\;+\\;\\frac{\\Delta\n            H_{vap}}{RT_1}\\;=\\;\\ln\\;P_2\\;\\;+\\;\\frac{\\Delta H_{vap}}{RT_2}\\;$$
which can be combined into:
$$\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta\n            H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\\right)$$
Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) has an\n                octane rating of 100. It is used as one of the standards for the octane-rating\n                system for gasoline. At 34.0 C, the vapor pressure of isooctane is 10.0 kPa, and at\n                98.8 C, its vapor pressure is 100.0 kPa. Use this information to estimate the\n                enthalpy of vaporization for isooctane.
The enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap,\n                can be determined by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
$$\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta\n                H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\\right)$$
Since we have two vapor pressure-temperature\n                values (T1 = 34.0 C = 307.2 K, P1 = 10.0 kPa and\n                T2 = 98.8 C = 372.0 K, P2 = 100 kPa), we can substitute\n                them into this equation and solve for \xceHvap. Rearranging the\n                Clausius-Clapeyron equation and solving for \xceHvap yields:
$$\\Delta\n                H_{vap}=\\frac{R\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}\\right)}{\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\\right)}=\\;\\frac{(8.314\\;\\mathrm\n                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm\n                K)\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{100.\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}{10.0\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}}\\right)}{\\left(\{307.2\\;\\mathrm\n                K}-\{372.0\\;\\mathrm K}\\right)}\\;=33,800\\;\\mathrm\n                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\;=\\;33.8\\;\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{mol}$$
Note that the pressure can be in any units, so\n                long as they agree for both P values, but the temperature must be in kelvin for the\n                Clausius-Clapeyron equation to be valid.
For benzene (C6H6), the\n                normal boiling point is 80.1 C and the enthalpy of vaporization is 30.8 kJ/mol.\n                What is the boiling point of benzene in Denver, where atmospheric pressure = 83.4\n                kPa?
Solution\n
If the temperature and vapor pressure are known\n                at one point, along with the enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap, then the temperature\n                that corresponds to a different vapor pressure (or the vapor pressure that\n                corresponds to a different temperature) can be determined by using the\n                Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
$$\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta\n                H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\\right)$$
Since the normal boiling point is the\n                temperature at which the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure at sea level, we\n                know one vapor pressure-temperature value (T1 = 80.1 C = 353.3 K,\n                P1 = 101.3 kPa, \xceHvap = 30.8 kJ/mol) and want to find the\n                temperature (T2) that corresponds to vapor pressure P2 = 83.4\n                kPa. We can substitute these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and then\n                solve for T2. Rearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and solving for\n                T2 yields:
$$T_2\\;=\\left(\\frac{-R\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}\\right)}{\\Delta\n                H_{vap}}\\;+\\;\{T_1}\\right)^{-1}\\;=\\;\\left(\\frac{-(8.3145\\;\\mathrm\n                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm\n                K)\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{83.4\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}{101.3\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}}\\right)}{30,800\\;\\mathrm\n                J/\\mathrm{mol}}\\;+\\;\{353.3\\;\\mathrm K}\\right)^{-1}$$

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Gravimetric Analysis,"A gravimetric analysis is a process in which a sample is subjected to some treatment that\n            causes a change in the physical state of the analyte that permits its separation from\n            the other components of the sample. Mass measurements of the sample, the isolated\n            analyte, or some other component of the analysis system, used along with the known\n            stoichiometry of the compounds involved, permit calculation of the analyte\n            concentration. Gravimetric methods were the first techniques used for quantitative\n            chemical analysis, and they remain important tools in the modern chemistry\n            laboratory.
The required change of state in a gravimetric analysis may be achieved by various\n            physical and chemical processes. A common gravimetric technique is one in which the\n            analyte is subjected to a precipitation reaction. The precipitate is typically isolated\n            from the reaction mixture by filtration, carefully dried, and then weighed. The mass of\n            the precipitate may then be used, along with relevant stoichiometric relationships, to\n            calculate analyte amount and/or concentration.

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Combustion Analysis,"The elemental composition of hydrocarbons and\n            related compounds may be determined via a gravimetric method known as combustion\n            analysis. In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high\n            temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield\n            gaseous products of known identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for\n            example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only products. The gaseous\n            combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing\n            compounds that selectively absorb each product, as shown in the figure below. The mass\n            increase of each device corresponds to the mass of the absorbed product and may be used\n            in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the relevant\n            element.
This schematic diagram illustrates the\n                basic components of a combustion analysis device for determining the carbon and\n                hydrogen content of a sample.
Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to\n                produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic items. A combustion\n                analysis of a 0.00126 g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2\n                and 0.00161 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?
The primary assumption in this exercise is that\n                all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon dioxide, and all the\n                hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:
$${\\mathrm C}_x{\\mathrm\n                H}_y\\mathit(s\\mathit)+excess\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)\\longrightarrow\n                x\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)+\\frac y2\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O(g)\\;\\;$$
Note that a balanced equation is not necessary\n                for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the compound, only the\n                subscripts x and y are needed.
First, calculate the molar amounts of carbon\n                and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the carbon dioxide and\n                water, respectively. With these molar amounts, the empirical formula for the\n                compound may be written as described in an earlier unit. An outline of this\n                approach is given in the following flow chart:
$$\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm C\\;=\\;0.00394\\;\\mathrm\n                g\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\;\\times\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}{44.01\\;\\mathrm\n                g}\\times\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm\n                C}{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2}\\;=\\;8.95\\;\^{-5}\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm\n                C$$
$$\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm H\\;=\\;0.00161\\;\\mathrm\n                g\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O\\;\\times\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm\n                O}{18.02\\;\\mathrm g}\\times\\frac{2\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm\n                H}{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm\n                O}\\;=\\;1.79\\;\^{-4}\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm H$$
The empirical formula for the compound is then\n                derived by identifying the smallest whole-number multiples for these molar amounts.\n                The H-to-C molar ratio is:

Considering these results, she will report that\r\n\t\t\tdispenser #1 is precise (values all close to one another, within a few tenths of a\r\n\t\t\tmilliliter) but not accurate (none of the values are close to the target value of 296\r\n\t\t\tmL, each being more than 10 mL too low). Results for dispenser #2 represent improved\r\n\t\t\taccuracy (each volume is less than 3 mL away from 296 mL) but worse precision (volumes\r\n\t\t\tvary by more than 4 mL).

The subject of acid-base chemistry will be\n                    discussed in much more detail later in this course.
reaction involving the transfer of a hydrogen ion between\n                                    reactant species
For purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common\n                    types of acid-base reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In this\n                    context, an \n                        acid\n                        \n                            \n                                substance that produces H3O+ when dissolved\n                                    in water\n                            \n                        \n                     is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions,\n                        H3O+. As an example, consider the equation shown\n                    here:
substance that produces H3O+ when dissolved\n                                    in water
The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an\n                    acid. When dissolved in water, H3O+ ions are produced by a\n                    chemical reaction in which H+ ions are transferred from HCl molecules\n                    to H2O molecules.
The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is\n                    essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water\n                    will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are\n                    called \n                        strong acids\n                        \n                            \n                                acids that reacts completely when dissolved in water to yield\n                                    hydronium ions\n                            \n                        \n                    , and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are\n                    classified as strong, as seen in the table below. A far greater number of\n                    compounds behave as \n                        weak acids\n                        \n                            \n                                acids that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved in water\n                                    to yield hydronium ions\n                            \n                        \n                     and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of\n                    dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small\n                    amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being\n                    the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the\n                    stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with\n                    body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient\n                    in food vinegars:
acids that reacts completely when dissolved in water to yield\n                                    hydronium ions
acids that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved in water\n                                    to yield hydronium ions
When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid\n                    molecules are present in the ionized form,\n                        CH3CO2 . (The use of a double-arrow in the\n                    equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept\n                    addressed fully later in this course).
A \n                                base\n                                \n                                    \n                                        substance that produces OH when dissolved in\n                                            water\n                                    \n                                \n                             is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide\n                            ions, OH. The most common bases are ionic compounds composed\n                            of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with\n                            the hydroxide ionfor example, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. When these\n                            compounds dissolve in water, hydroxide ions are released directly into\n                            the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)2 dissolve in water\n                            and dissociate completely to produce cations (K+ and\n                                Ba2+, respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH.\n                            These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in\n                            water, are considered \n                                strong bases\n                                \n                                    \n                                        bases that reacts completely when dissolved in water to\n                                            yield hydroxide ions\n                                    \n                                \n                            .
substance that produces OH when dissolved in\n                                            water
bases that reacts completely when dissolved in water to\n                                            yield hydroxide ions
Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in\n                            water:
This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in\n                            water, NaOH dissociates to yield Na+ and OH ions.\n                            This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide\n                            ions. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic\n                            compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other\n                            ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.
Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when\n                            dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases,\n                            these compounds react only partially and so are classified as \n                                weak bases\n                                \n                                    \n                                        bases that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved\n                                            in water to yield hydroxide ions\n                                    \n                                \n                            . These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and\n                            important commodities in various technologies. For example, global\n                            production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric\n                            tons annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw\n                            material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active\n                            ingredient in household cleaners. When dissolved in water, ammonia\n                            reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here:
bases that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved\n                                            in water to yield hydroxide ions
This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the\n                            transfer of H+ ions from water molecules to ammonia\n                            molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved\n                            ammonia is present as NH4+ ions.
The chemical reactions described in which acids and bases dissolved in\n                            water produce hydronium and hydroxide ions, respectively, are, by\n                            definition, acid-base reactions. In these reactions, water serves as\n                            both a solvent and a reactant. A neutralization reaction is a specific\n                            type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a\n                            base, the products are often a salt and water, and neither reactant is\n                            the water itself:
To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a\n                            typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an aqueous suspension of solid\n                                Mg(OH)2 is ingested to ease symptoms associated with\n                            excess stomach acid (HCl):
Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium\n                            chloride.
Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the\n                                following reaction:
The weak acid hydrogen hypochlorite reacts with water.
The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H2O. Since the\n                                substance is reported to be an acid, its reaction with water will\n                                involve the transfer of H+ from HOCl to H2O to\n                                generate hydronium ions, H3O+ and hypochlorite\n                                ions, OCl.
A double-arrow is appropriate in this equation because it indicates\n                                the HOCl is a weak acid that has not reacted completely.
Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the\n                                following reaction:
A solution of barium hydroxide is neutralized with a solution of\n                                nitric acid.
The two reactants are provided, Ba(OH)2 and\n                                    HNO3. Since this is a neutralization reaction, the\n                                two products will be water and a salt composed of the cation of the\n                                ionic hydroxide (Ba2+) and the anion generated when the\n                                acid transfers its hydrogen ion (NO3).

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,The Bohr Model of the Atom,"Following the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth\n            century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and\n            even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This\n            picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature csolar\n            systemd with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. This\n            classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron\n            moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and,\n            according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic\n            radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electrons orbit getting\n            continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are\n            inherently unstable.
In 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical\n            electromagnetisms prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously\n            emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the\n            atom Plancks ideas of quantization and Einsteins finding that light consists of\n            photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron\n            orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state\n            hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The\n            energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies.
Bohr assumed that only discrete values for these could occur. Bohr was able to calculate\n            the energies of each orbital and he found that they fit the following equation:
In this expression, k is a constant comprising fundamental constants of Ryberg\'s contant,\n            Plancks constant and the speed of light ( k = (hcRH) =\n            2.18-18 J ). The energies of the orbitals calculated are seen in the\n            image below. Notice that as the more negative the calculated value, the lower the energy\n            with n = 1 having the most negative value, which means it has the lowest energy.
One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest\n            possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit,\n            the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. \n            When the electron is in this lowest energy\n            orbit, the atom is said to be in its ground electronic statestate in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible (or simply ground state). If the\n            atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to\n            an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic statestate having an energy greater than the ground-state energy (or\n            simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an\n            excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the\n            difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an\n            atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more\n            excited one.
state in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible
state having an energy greater than the ground-state energy
We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about\n            energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy\n            energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron\n            from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the\n            electron returns to its initial state. In effect, an atom can cstored energy by using it\n            to promote an electron to a state with a higher energy and release it when the electron\n            returns to a lower state. The energy can be released as one quantum of energy, as the\n            electron returns to its ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 1), or it can be released\n            as two or more smaller quanta as the electron falls to an intermediate state, then to\n            the ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 4, emitting one quantum, then to n = 1,\n            emitting a second quantum).

Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Chemical Reactions,"When we use calorimetry to determine the heat involved in a chemical reaction, the same\n            principles we have been discussing apply. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter\n            is often small enough that we can neglect it (though not for highly accurate\n            measurements, as discussed later), and the calorimeter minimizes energy exchange with\n            the surroundings. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical\n            reaction, there is no overall energy change during the reaction. The heat produced or\n            consumed in the reaction (the csystemd), qreaction, plus the heat absorbed or lost by\n            the solution (the csurroundingsd), qsolution, must add up to zero:
This means that the amount of heat produced or consumed in the reaction equals the amount\n            of heat absorbed or lost by the solution:
This concept lies at the heart of all calorimetry problems and calculations.
When 50.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl(aq) and 50.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH(aq), both at 22.0 C, are\n                added to a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum\n                of 28.9 C. What is the approximate amount of heat produced by this reaction?
To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so\n                quickly that no reaction took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the\n                reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have 100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl\n                and NaOH at 22.0 C. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution temperature\n                reaches 28.9 C.
The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution.\n                Therefore:
(It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter\n                does not absorb any heat from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between\n                the calorimeter and its surroundings.)
Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat,\n                mass, and temperature change:
To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions\n                or approximations. Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water\n                in terms of its specific heat and mass values. The density of water is approximately\n                1.0 g/mL, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about 1.0  g (two significant\n                figures). The specific heat of water is approximately 4.184 J/g C, so we use that\n                for the specific heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives:
Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have:
The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic. It produces 2.89 kJ of\n                heat.
If the amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is too large to neglect or if we\n                    require more accurate results, then we must take into account the heat absorbed\n                    both by the solution and by the calorimeter.
The calorimeters described above are designed to operate at constant (atmospheric)\n                    pressure and are convenient to measure heat flow accompanying processes that\n                    occur in solution. A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant\n                    volume, colloquially known as a bomb calorimeterdevice designed to measure the energy change for processes occurring under conditions of constant volume; commonly used for reactions involving solid and gaseous reactants or products, is used to measure the energy\n                    produced by reactions that yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products,\n                    such as combustion reactions. (The term cbombd comes from the observation that\n                    these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage\n                    other calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel\n                    container (the cbombd) that contains the reactants and is itself submerged in\n                    water, as seen in the image below. The sample is placed in the bomb, which is\n                    then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to\n                    ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is trapped in the steel\n                    bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along\n                    with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy\n                    produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the\n                    heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. Once the heat\n                    capacity of the bomb calorimeter is determined, this is taken into consideration\n                    in the calculation for qreaction.
device designed to measure the energy change for processes occurring under conditions of constant volume; commonly used for reactions involving solid and gaseous reactants or products
qbomb is calculated by multiplying the\n                            heat capacity of the bomb, as determined by calibration, and the observed\n                            change in temperature caused by the reaction.
When 3.12 g of glucose, C6H12O6, is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the\n                        temperature of the calorimeter increases from 23.8 C to 35.6 C. The\n                        calorimeter contains 775 g of water, and the bomb itself has a heat capacity\n                        of 893 J/C. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the glucose\n                        sample?
The combustion produces heat that is primarily absorbed by the water and the\n                        bomb. (The amounts of heat absorbed by the reaction products and the\n                        unreacted excess oxygen are relatively small and dealing with them is beyond\n                        the scope of this online course. We will neglect them in our calculations.)
The heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the water and the bomb:
= [(4.184 J/g C)(775g)  (35.6 C.8 C)] + [893 J/C  (35.6 C.8 C)]
= (38,300 J + 10,500 J)
,800 J = .8 kJ
This reaction released 48.7 kJ of heat when 3.12 g of glucose was burned.",
Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Chemical Formulas,"A molecular formulaA representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule. is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to\n            indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each\n            type in the molecule. (A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type\n            is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of\n            compounds.

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C\n            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines\n            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between\n            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss\n            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For\n            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a\n            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with\n            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the\n            atoms.
A representation of a molecule that gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule.
Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules\n            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,\n            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules\n            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular\n            formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements\n            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine\n                (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most\n            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms\n            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a\n            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent\n            distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a\n            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are\n            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate\n            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents\n            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the\n            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium\n            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of\n            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present\n            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.\n            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,\n            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies\n            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and\n            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the\n            element titanium.
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which\n            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the\n            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from\n            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum\n            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be\n            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen\n            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the\n            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals\n            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the\n            molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
If we know a compounds formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is\n            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual\n            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives\n            vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic\n            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of\n            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,\n            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a\n            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Units of Solution Concentration: Mass and Volume Percentage,"In the previous section, we introduced molarity, a very useful measurement unit for\n            evaluating the concentration of solutions. However, molarity is only one measure of\n            concentration. In this section, we will introduce some other units of concentration that\n            are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention.
Earlier, we introduced percent composition as a measure of the relative amount of\n                    a given element in a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the\n                    composition of mixtures, including solutions. The mass percentageratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage\n                       of a solution\n                    component is defined as the ratio of the components mass to the solutions\n                    mass, expressed as a percentage.
ratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage\n
We are generally most interested in the mass percentages of solutes, but it is\n                    also possible to compute the mass percentage of solvent.
Mass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass,\n                    percent weight, weight/weight percent, and other variations on this theme. The\n                    most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the percent sign, %, although\n                    more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use\n                    of these more detailed symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with\n                    other types of percentages, such as volume percentages (to be discussed later in\n                    this section).
Mass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label\n                    of a typical liquid bleach bottle cites the concentration of its active\n                    ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being 7.4%. A 100.0g sample of\n                    bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.
A 5.0g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What\n                        is the percent by mass of glucose in spinal fluid?
Substituting the given masses into the equation defining mass percentage\n                        yields:
Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg,\n                        g, kg, oz, and so on), the same unit must be used for both the solute and\n                        the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio.\n                        In this case, we converted the units of solute in the numerator from mg to g\n                        to match the units in the denominator. We could just as easily have\n                        converted the denominator from g to mg instead. As long as identical mass\n                        units are used for both solute and solution, the computed mass percentage\n                        will be correct.
cConcentratedd hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is\n                        commonly used as a laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19\n                        g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution?
In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage,\n                        we need to know the corresponding mass of the solution. Using the solution\n                        density given, we can convert the solutions volume to mass, and then use\n                        the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical\n                        approach is outlined in this flowchart:
For proper unit cancellation, the 0.500 L volume is converted into 500 mL,\n                        and the mass percentage is expressed as a ratio, 37.2g HCl/g solution:
Liquid volumes over a wide range of magnitudes are conveniently measured\n                            using common and relatively inexpensive laboratory equipment. The\n                            concentration of a solution formed by dissolving a liquid solute in a\n                            liquid solvent is therefore often expressed as a volume percentageratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage, %vol\n                            or (v/v)%.
ratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage
Rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) is usually sold as a 70% vol aqueous\n                                solution. If the density of isopropyl alcohol is 0.785 g/mL, how\n                                many grams of isopropyl alcohol are present in a 355 mL bottle of\n                                rubbing alcohol?
Per the definition of volume percentage, the isopropanol volume is\n                                70% of the total solution volume. Multiplying the isopropanol volume\n                                by its density yields the requested mass:

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Dipole-Dipole Attractions,"Recall from the unit on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that polar molecules have\n            a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of\n            the moleculea separation of charge called a dipole. Consider a polar molecule such as\n            hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl atom bears the\n            partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial\n            positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction\n            between the positive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This\n            attractive force is called a dipole-dipole attractionthe electrostatic force between\n            the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of\n            another, as illustrated below.
The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of\n            HCl molecules to nonpolar F2 molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of\n            the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass. At a\n            temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE.\n            However, the dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause\n            them to cstick togetherd to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion\n            forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are not, and so this substance is\n            gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to\n                F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole\n            attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar\n                F2 molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing\n            points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths\n            of IMFs of attraction present within different substances.
Predict which will have the higher boiling point: N2 or CO. Explain your\n                reasoning.
CO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience\n                similar London dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences\n                dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit\n                dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO molecules are\n                comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO\n                is expected to have the higher boiling point.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Electron Affinities,"The electron affinity [EA] is the energy change for\r\n\t\t\tthe process of adding an electron to a gaseous atom to form an anion (negative ion).
\r\n\t\t\t$$X(g) + e^- \\rightarrow X^-(g) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{EA}_1$$\r\n\t\t
This process can be either endothermic or\r\n\t\t\texothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is given in\r\n\t\t\tperiodic table below. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of\r\n\t\t\tEA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron.\r\n\t\t\tHowever, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively charged\r\n\t\t\tand the value of their EA is positive. (It is important to note that the more negative a\r\n\t\t\tvalue for EA the greater its EA. The values indicate the magnitude of energy change, the\r\n\t\t\tsign indicates the direction.) Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values are\r\n\t\t\tassociated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated\r\n\t\t\twith adding an electron to an anion to form a  ion, and so on.
As we might predict, it becomes easier to add an\r\n\t\t\telectron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atoms\r\n\t\t\tincreases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more\r\n\t\t\tnegative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), and\r\n\t\t\tgroup 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. The\r\n\t\t\tnoble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electron\r\n\t\t\tmust be added to a higher n level, which is more difficult to do. Group 2 (2A) has a\r\n\t\t\tfilled ns subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy np, so,\r\n\t\t\tagain, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A)\r\n\t\t\thas a half-filled np subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing np\r\n\t\t\telectron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron\r\n\t\t\tconfiguration disrupts the trend in EA.
We also might expect the atom at the top of each\r\n\t\t\tgroup to have the largest EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atoms\r\n\t\t\thave the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see\r\n\t\t\tthat the second element in the group most often has the greatest EA. The reduction of\r\n\t\t\tthe EA of the first member can be attributed to the small size of the n = 2 shell and\r\n\t\t\tthe resulting large electronelectron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA\r\n\t\t\tvalue of  kJ/mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA\r\n\t\t\tof fluorine is  kJ/mol. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form a\r\n\t\t\tfluoride anion (F  ), we add an electron to the n = 2 shell. The electron is\r\n\t\t\tattracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other\r\n\t\t\telectrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the same\r\n\t\t\telectron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is going\r\n\t\t\tinto the n = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the\r\n\t\t\telectronelectron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as\r\n\t\t\tmuch repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily.
The properties discussed in this module (size of\r\n\t\t\tatoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities)\r\n\t\t\tare central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an\r\n\t\t\tenergetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much\r\n\t\t\teasier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivity\r\n\t\t\tand malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons that\r\n\t\t\tcan be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and\r\n\t\t\tdecreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is\r\n\t\t\teasier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.

Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Module Summary and Quiz,"Energy is the capacity to do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE)\n        is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position,\n        composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy\n        is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of\n        thermodynamics).
The total of all energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (E). As a\n            system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred\n            from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. The change\n            in internal energy of a system can be determined from the equation \xceE = q + w. When the work done\n            by or on the system is pressure-volume work, the change in internal energy is calculated\n            using the equation: \xceE = q  P\xceV.

Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Gases in Liquids,"The chemical structures of the solute and solvent dictate the types of forces possible\n            and, consequently, are important factors in determining solubility. For example, under\n            similar conditions, the water solubility of oxygen is approximately three times greater\n            than that of helium, but 100 times less than the solubility of chloromethane,\n                CHCl3. Considering the role of the solvents chemical structure, note\n            that the solubility of oxygen in the liquid hydrocarbon hexane,\n                C6H14, is approximately 20 times greater than it is in\n            water.
Other factors also affect the solubility of a given substance in a given solvent.\n            Temperature is one such factor, with gas solubility typically decreasing as temperature\n            increases, as seen in the graph below. This is one of the major impacts resulting from\n            the thermal pollution of natural bodies of water.
When the temperature of a river, lake, or stream is raised abnormally high, usually due\n            to the discharge of hot water from some industrial process, the solubility of oxygen in\n            the water is decreased. Decreased levels of dissolved oxygen may have serious\n            consequences for the health of the waters ecosystems and, in severe cases, can result\n            in large-scale fish kills.
The solubility of a gaseous solute is also affected by the partial pressure of solute in\n            the gas to which the solution is exposed. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of\n            the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration of this\n            relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively\n            high pressure of carbon dioxide gas and then sealing the beverage container, thus\n            saturating the beverage with CO2 at this pressure. When the beverage\n            container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is\n            released, and some of the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in\n            the form of small bubbles. At this point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon\n            dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration will decrease to its\n            equilibrium value and the beverage will become cflat.d
For many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility and partial pressure is a\n            proportional one and can be determined using Henry\'s law.
The quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is\n                    directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.
where Cg is solubility, Pg is partial pressure, and k\n                    is a proportionality constant that depends on the identities of the gaseous\n                    solute and solvent, and on the solution temperature.
At 20 C, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water exposed to gaseous oxygen at\n                a partial pressure of 101.3 kPa is 1.38  10 mol L. Use\n                Henrys law to determine the solubility of oxygen when its partial pressure is 20.7\n                kPa, the approximate pressure of oxygen in earths atmosphere.
According to Henrys law, for an ideal solution the solubility, Cg, of a gas (1.38  10 mol L, in\n                this case) is directly proportional to the pressure, Pg, of the undissolved gas above the solution (101.3 kPa in\n                this case). Because we know both Cg and Pg, we can rearrange this expression to solve for\n                    k.
Now we can use k to find the solubility at the lower pressure.
Notice that as the pressure decreased from 101.3 kPa to 20.7 kPa the concentration also decreased, \n                illustrating the direct proportionality of pressure and concentration of a gas in a liquid.\n          \n

Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Collection of Gas over Water,"A simple way to collect gases that do not react\r\n\t\t\twith water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with water and inverted\r\n\t\t\tinto a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be made\r\n\t\t\tequal to the air pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the water\r\n\t\t\tlevel is the same both inside and outside the bottle, the pressure of the gas is equal\r\n\t\t\tto the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer.
When a reaction produces a gas that is\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcollected above water, the trapped gas is a mixture of the gas produced by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\treaction and water vapor. If the collection flask is appropriately positioned to\r\n\t\t\t\t\tequalize the water levels both within and outside the flask, the pressure of the\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttrapped gas mixture will equal the atmospheric pressure outside the flask (see\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe earlier discussion of manometers).
However, there is another factor we must consider\r\n\t\t\twhen we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water evaporates and there is\r\n\t\t\talways gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collected\r\n\t\t\tover water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixture\r\n\t\t\tequals the partial pressure of the gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. The\r\n\t\t\tpressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure minus the pressure of\r\n\t\t\tthe water vaporthis is referred to as the cdryd gas pressure, that is, the pressure of\r\n\t\t\tthe gas only, without water vapor. The vapor pressure of water, which is the pressure\r\n\t\t\texerted by water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water in a closed container, depends\r\n\t\t\ton the temperature; more detailed information on the temperature dependence of water\r\n\t\t\tvapor can be found in the table below, and vapor pressure will be discussed in more\r\n\t\t\tdetail later in the course.
This graph shows the vapor pressure of\r\n\t\t\t\t\twater at sea level as a function of temperature.
Video Demonstration: This video shows the collection of gas over water.
If 0.200 L of argon is collected over water at\r\n\t\t\t\ta temperature of 26 C and a pressure of 750 torr in a system like that shown in\r\n\t\t\t\tdiagram above, what is the partial pressure of argon?
According to Daltons law, the total pressure\r\n\t\t\t\tin the bottle (750 torr) is the sum of the partial pressure of argon and the partial\r\n\t\t\t\tpressure of gaseous water:
$$P_T = P_{Ar} + P_{H_2O}$$
Rearranging this equation to solve for the\r\n\t\t\t\tpressure of argon gives:
$$P_{Ar} = P_T - P_{H_2O}$$
The pressure of water vapor above a sample of\r\n\t\t\t\tliquid water at 26 C is 25.2 torr, so:
$$P_{Ar} = 750\\ \\mathrm{torr} - 25.2\\\r\n\t\t\t\t\\mathrm{torr} = 725\\ \\mathrm{torr}$$
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas and an aqueous solution of a\r\n\t\t\t\tmetal anion. The reaction of hydrochloric acid and zinc is one such reaction.
The gas is collected as seen in the image below.
The reaction takes place at room temperature of 23.0 oC and an atmospheric pressure of 750.0 torr.

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,The Structures of Ionic Crystals,"Ionic crystals consist of two or more different\n            kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these ions into a\n            crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same\n            size.
Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and\n            their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction.\n            Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge\n            are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the\n            cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two\n            principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of\n            positive and negative ions in the compound.
In simple ionic structures, we usually find the\n            anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array.\n            (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions\n            larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when\n            compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy\n            one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of\n            the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane.\n            The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so\n            the hole is called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of\n            six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at the corners of\n            an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. The figure below illustrates both of\n            these types of holes.
Cations may occupy two types of holes\n                between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes.
Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and\n            anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or octahedral holes, as\n            illustrated in the figure below. Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and\n            larger cations occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the\n            octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open structure, such as a simple cubic\n            array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the\n            more open spacing.
A cations size and the shape of the\n                hole occupied by the compound are directly related.
There are two tetrahedral holes for each anion in\n            either an HCP or CCP array of anions. A compound that crystallizes in a closest-packed\n            array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes can have a maximum cation:anion\n            ratio of 2:1; all of the tetrahedral holes are filled at this ratio. Examples include\n            Li2O, Na2O, Li2S, and Na2S. Compounds\n            with a ratio of less than 2:1 may also crystallize in a closest-packed array of anions\n            with cations in the tetrahedral holes, if the ionic sizes fit. In these compounds,\n            however, some of the tetrahedral holes remain vacant.
The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either\n            an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1. Thus, compounds with cations in octahedral holes in a\n            closest-packed array of anions can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 1:1. In NiO,\n            MnS, NaCl, and KH, for example, all of the octahedral holes are filled. Ratios of less\n            than 1:1 are observed when some of the octahedral holes remain empty.
In a simple cubic array of anions, there is one\n            cubic hole that can be occupied by a cation for each anion in the array. In CsCl, and in\n            other compounds with the same structure, all of the cubic holes are occupied. Half of\n            the cubic holes are occupied in SrH2, UO2, SrCl2, and\n            CaF2.
Different types of ionic compounds often\n            crystallize in the same structure when the relative sizes of their ions and their\n            stoichiometries (the two principal features that determine structure) are similar. Many\n            ionic compounds crystallize with cubic unit cells, and we will use these compounds to\n            describe the general features of ionic structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of cations and\n            anions of similar size in a 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple cubic structure.\n            Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated below) is an example of this, with Cs+ and Cl\n            having radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions\n            forming a simple cubic unit cell, with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions\n            forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple cubic unit cells\n            formed by Cs+ ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cl ions.\n            Cesium ions and chloride ions touch along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One\n            cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry\n            required by the formula for cesium chloride. Note that there is no lattice point in the\n            center of the cell, and CsCl is not a BCC structure because a cesium ion is not\n            identical to a chloride ion.
Ionic compounds with similar-sized\n                cations and anions, such as CsCl, usually form a simple cubic structure. They\n                can be described by unit cells with either cations at the corners or anions at\n                the corners.
We have said that the location of lattice points is\n            arbitrary. This is illustrated by an alternate description of the CsCl structure in\n            which the lattice points are located in the centers of the cesium ions. In this\n            description, the cesium ions are located on the lattice points at the corners of the\n            cell, and the chloride ion is located at the center of the cell. The two unit cells are\n            different, but they describe identical structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio\n            of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically crystallizes with\n            an FCC unit cell, like that shown below. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this,\n            with Na+ and Cl having radii of 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively.\n            We can think of this as chloride ions forming an FCC cell, with sodium ions located in\n            the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell. The\n            sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains\n            four sodium ions and four chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the\n            formula, NaCl.
Ionic compounds with anions that are\n                much larger than cations, such as NaCl, usually form an FCC structure. They can\n                be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral\n                holes.
The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also\n            crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated below. This structure contains sulfide\n            ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is\n            identical to the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc\n            ion is only about 40% of the radius of a sulfide ion, so these small Zn2+\n            ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the\n            tetrahedral holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell,\n            giving the empirical formula ZnS.
ZnS, zinc sulfide (or zinc blende)\n                forms an FCC unit cell with sulfide ions at the lattice points and much smaller\n                zinc ions occupying half of the tetrahedral holes in the\n                structure.
A calcium fluoride unit cell, like that shown in\n            the following figure, is also an FCC unit cell, but in this case, the cations are\n            located on the lattice points; equivalent calcium ions are located on the lattice points\n            of an FCC lattice. All of the tetrahedral sites in the FCC array of calcium ions are\n            occupied by fluoride ions. There are four calcium ions and eight fluoride ions in a unit\n            cell, giving a calcium:fluorine ratio of 1:2, as required by the chemical formula,\n            CaF2. Close examination of the figure will reveal a simple cubic array of\n            fluoride ions with calcium ions in one half of the cubic holes. The structure cannot be\n            described in terms of a space lattice of points on the fluoride ions because the\n            fluoride ions do not all have identical environments. The orientation of the four\n            calcium ions about the fluoride ions differs.
Calcium fluoride, CaF2,\n                forms an FCC unit cell with calcium ions (green) at the lattice points and\n                fluoride ions (red) occupying all of the tetrahedral sites between\n                them.",
Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Modern Atomic Theory,"The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms.\n            It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleusmassive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons composed of positively charged\n            protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing\n            negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atoms mass\n            because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy\n            almost all of an atoms volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of\n                10 m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10-15\n            mabout 100,000 times smaller.
massive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons
For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size\n            of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium.
Atomsand the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose themare extremely small. For\n            example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2  10 g. When describing the\n            properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure.\n            The atomic mass unit (amu) is the unit of mass that is used for masses of atoms,\n            molecules, and subatomic particles. The amu is defined with regard to the most abundant\n            isotope of carbon, carbon. An atom of carbon contains 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6\n            electrons. (Isotopes will be discussed in more detail in the next module). The mass of a\n            carbon atom is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. Thus, one amu is exactly 1/12 of the\n            mass of one carbon atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 x 10 g.
The charge of subatomic particles is also extremely small. Like the amu, an appropriately\n            small unit of charge has been developed to describe the charge of subatomic particles.\n            An electron has a charge of less than 2  C (coulomb). The fundamental\n            unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of\n            an electron (e) with e = 1.602 x 10 C.
A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier\n            particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is\n            neutral. The electron has a charge of 1 and is a much lighter particle with a mass of\n            about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton).\n            The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in table below.
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number (Z). This is the\n            defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For\n            example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic\n            number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must\n            contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons\n            equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number\n            of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called\n            its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass\n            number and the atomic number: A  Z = number of neutrons.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Multiple Bonds,"The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving\n            single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and\n            triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of \xcf and \xcf bonds.\n            Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid\n            orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C2H4, shows us that each\n            carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.
The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect\n            the \xcf bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of sp2 hybrid\n            orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p orbitals and the 2s orbital.\n            These orbitals form the CH single bonds and the \xcf bond in the C=C double bond. The \xcf\n            bond in the C=C double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2p orbital\n            on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital\n            (lobes shown in red and blue in diagrams below) is perpendicular to the plane of the\n                sp2 hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a\n            side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis and form a \xcf bond.
In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the\n            same plane. If the two planes of sp2 hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each\n            other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the \xcf bond.\n            The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable\n            bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between \xcf and \xcf bonds; rotation\n            around single (\xcf) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not\n            depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other\n            words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the \xcf\n            bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the\n            axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds;\n            however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the \xcf bonding orbitals,\n            essentially breaking the \xcf bond.
In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom. We\n            find this situation in acetylene, HCCH, which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid\n            orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a \xcf bond between the carbon\n            atoms. The remaining sp orbitals form \xcf bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized\n            p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence,\n            form two \xcf bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one \xcf\n            bond and two \xcf bonds, giving a triple bond.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Energy of Orbitals,"Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and quantum mechanics, we can use our\n            understanding of quantum numbers to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another.\n            This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The\n            specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical\n            properties of that atom.
The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, n, increases. In\n            any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies\n            of subshells with different values of l differ so that the energy of the orbitals\n            increases within a shell in the order s < p < d < f. The diagram below, which\n            we saw previously, depicts how these two trends in increasing energy relate. The 1s\n            orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy. The\n            energy increases as we move up to the 2s and then 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, showing that\n            the increasing n value has more influence on energy than the increasing l value for\n            small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The 3d orbital is\n            higher in energy than the 4s orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we\n            move up the chart.
In their ground state, electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill\n            low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the\n            5p orbitals fill immediately after the 4d, and immediately before the 6s. The filling\n            order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical\n            calculations. As the principal quantum number, n, increases, the size of the orbital\n            increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the\n            attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher\n            (less stabilized). This order of orbitals from lowest energy to highest energy is\n            important, but you do not need to memorize it. We will see shortly that this order is\n            represented in the structure of the periodic table.

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions,"A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that\n            only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are\n            capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide\n            elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove\n            metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of\n            how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable\n            membranes.
Consider the apparatus illustrated in the diagram below, in which samples of pure solvent\n            and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate.\n            Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the\n            concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these\n            molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a\n            faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of\n            solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of\n            solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.
When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown above, the volume of the\n            solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the\n            level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of\n            the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent\n            molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a\n            reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent\n            ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (\xce) of the solution.
The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T,\n                    according to the equation
where R is the universal gas constant.
If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in Figure, applying pressure\n            greater than the osmotic pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes\n            solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent. This technique of reverse\n            osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to\n            produce high-purity tap water for drinking.
What is the osmotic pressure (atm) of a 0.30 M solution of glucose in water that is\n                used for intravenous infusion at body temperature, 37 C?
We can find the osmotic pressure, \xce, using the formula \xce = MRT, where T is on the\n                Kelvin scale (310 K) and the value of R is expressed in appropriate units (0.08206 L\n                atm/mol K).
Examples of osmosis are evident in many biological systems because cells are surrounded\n            by semipermeable membranes. Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have\n            lost water can be made crisp again by placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot\n            or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated salt solution loses\n            water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect\n            animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are\n            injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions\n            an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body must have\n            the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood\n            serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient\n            quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood\n            cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called\n            hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the\n            cells lose water to the more concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a\n            process called crenation. These effects are illustrated below.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Percent Composition,"In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between the bulk mass of a\n            substance and the number of atoms or molecules it contains (moles). Given the chemical\n            formula of the substance, we were able to determine the amount of the substance (moles)\n            from its mass, and vice versa. But what if the chemical formula of a substance is\n            unknown? In this section, we will explore how to apply these very same principles in\n            order to derive the chemical formulas of unknown substances from experimental mass\n            measurements.
The elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas\n            are the most succinct way of representing this elemental makeup. When a compounds\n            formula is unknown, measuring the mass of each of its constituent elements is often the\n            first step in the process of determining the formula experimentally. The results of\n            these measurements permit the calculation of the compounds \n                percent composition\n                \n                    \n                        percentage by mass of the various elements in a compound\n                    \n                \n            , defined as the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. For\n            example, consider a gaseous compound composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. The percent\n            composition of this compound could be represented as follows:
percentage by mass of the various elements in a compound
If analysis of a 10.0-g sample of this gas showed it to contain 2.5 g H and 7.5 g C, the\n            percent composition would be calculated to be 25% H and 75% C:
Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and\n                nitrogen showed it to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent\n                composition of this compound?
To calculate percent composition, we divide the experimentally derived mass of each\n                element by the overall mass of the compound, and then convert to a percentage:
The analysis results indicate that the compound is 61.0% C, 15.4% H, and 23.7% N by\n                mass.
Percent composition is also useful for evaluating the relative abundance of a\n                    given element in different compounds of known formulas. As one example, consider\n                    the common nitrogen-containing fertilizers ammonia (NH3), ammonium\n                    nitrate (NH4NO3), and urea (CH4N2O).\n                    The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the\n                    mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern\n                    for consumers choosing among these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications,\n                    the percent composition of a compound is easily derived from its formula mass\n                    and the atomic masses of its constituent elements. A molecule of NH3 contains\n                    one N atom weighing 14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3  1.008\n                    amu) = 3.024 amu. The formula mass of ammonia is therefore (14.01 amu + 3.024\n                    amu) = 17.03 amu, and its percent composition is:
This same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen\n                    molecules, or a mole of molecules, etc. The latter amount is most convenient and\n                    would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic and formula\n                    masses, as demonstrated in the example. As long as we know the chemical formula of\n                    the substance in question, we can easily derive percent composition from the\n                    formula mass or molar mass.
Aspirin is a compound with the molecular formula\n                            C9H8O4. What is its percent\n                        composition?
To calculate the percent composition, we need to know the masses of C, H, and\n                        O in a known mass of C9H8O4. It is\n                        convenient to consider 1 mol of C9H8O4 and\n                        use its molar mass (180.159 g/mole, determined from the chemical formula) to\n                        calculate the percentages of each of its elements:

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Polarity,"If the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in H2,\n            Cl2, and other diatomic molecules, then the electrons in the bond must be\n            shared equally. We refer to this as a pure, or nonpolar, covalent bond. Electrons shared in pure\n            covalent bonds have an equal probability of being near each nucleus. In the case of\n                Cl2, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl\n            shares one electron with the other, forming one covalent bond:
The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding\n            electrons and two shared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching\n            the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since the bonding atoms are\n            identical, Cl2 also features a pure covalent bond.
When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared,\n            but no longer equally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom\n            than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density toward that atom. This\n            unequal distribution of electrons is known as a polar covalent bondcovalent bond between atoms of different electronegativities; a covalent bond with a positive end and a negative end, characterized by a\n            partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom\n            that attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice\n            versa. For example, the electrons in the HCl bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend\n            more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule,\n            the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial\n            positive charge. Figure shows the distribution of electrons in the HCl bond. Note that\n            the shaded area around Cl is much larger than it is around H. Compare this to the\n                H2 nonpolar bond which shares electrons equally and there is an even\n            distribution of electrons between the two atoms.
covalent bond between atoms of different electronegativities; a covalent bond with a positive end and a negative end
We sometimes designate the positive and negative atoms in a polar covalent bond using a\n            lowercase Greek letter cdelta,d \xce, with a plus sign or minus sign to indicate whether\n            the atom has a partial positive charge (\xce+) or a partial negative charge (\xce). This\n            symbolism is shown for the HCl molecule.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Module Summary and Quiz,"VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule.\n                    It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that\n                    minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone\n                    pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a\n                    molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only\n                    when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment\n                    measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is\n                    determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a\n                    molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond\n                    moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar\n                    molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric\n                    fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Resonance,"Some molecules can have two possible structures with the atoms in the same positions and\n            have identical formal charges such as the nitrite ion seen below. The electrons involved\n            in the NO double bond, however, are in different positions:
If nitrite ions do indeed contain a single and a double bond, we would expect for the two\n            bond lengths to be different. A double bond between two atoms is shorter (and stronger)\n            than a single bond between the same two atoms. Experiments show, however, that both NO\n            bonds in NO2 have the same strength and length, and are identical\n            in all other properties.
It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for NO2 in\n            which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are equivalent. Instead, we use the concept\n            of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement of atoms can be\n            written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of\n            that shown by the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each\n            of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in NO2 is the average of a double\n            bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance formstwo or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons. The\n            actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is\n            called a resonance hybridaverage of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow\n            between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. Thus, the electronic\n            structure of the NO2 ion is shown as:
two or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons
average of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures
We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an\n            electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between\n            resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that\n            shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory,\n            used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and\n            resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described\n            it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with\n            both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a\n            resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros,\n            it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some\n            characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves\n            are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).
The carbonate anion, CO32, provides a second example of\n            resonance:
One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central\n            atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any\n            one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion.\n            Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual\n            arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures.\n            Again, experiments show that all three CO bonds are exactly the same.

Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Titration,"In the 18th century, the concentration of vinegar\r\n\t\t\tsamples was determined by noting the amount of potassium carbonate, K2CO3 , which had to be added, a little at a time, before bubbling ceased.\r\n\t\t\tThe greater the weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where the\r\n\t\t\tbubbling ended, the more concentrated the vinegar.
We now know that the effervescence that occurred\r\n\t\t\tduring this process was due to reaction with acetic acid, CH3CO2H, the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste of\r\n\t\t\tvinegar. Acetic acid reacts with potassium carbonate according to the following\r\n\t\t\tequation:
The bubbling was due to the production of CO2 gas.
The test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is one\r\n\t\t\ttype of quantitative analysisthe determination of the amount or concentration of a\r\n\t\t\tsubstance in a sample. In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute\r\n\t\t\t(acetic acid) was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solute\r\n\t\t\tpresent in a known volume of the solution. In other types of chemical analyses, the\r\n\t\t\tamount of a substance present in a sample is determined by measuring the amount of\r\n\t\t\tproduct that results.
The described approach to measuring vinegar\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstrength was an early version of the analytical technique known as titration\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tanalysisquantitative chemical analysis method that involves measuring the volume of a reactant solution required to completely react with the analyte in a sample. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buretdevice used for the precise delivery of variable liquid volumes, such as in a titration analysis to make\r\n\t\t\t\t\tincremental additions of a solution containing a known concentration of some\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsubstance (the titrantsolution containing a known concentration of substance that will react with the analyte in a titration analysis) to a sample solution containing the substance whose\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconcentration is to be measured (the analytechemical species of interest). The titrant and analyte undergo a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tchemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrant\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsolution required for complete reaction with the analyte (the equivalence pointvolume of titrant solution required to react completely with the analyte in a titration analysis; provides a stoichiometric amount of titrant for the samples analyte according to the titration reaction\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration.

The equivalence point of a titration may be\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdetected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solution\r\n\t\t\t\t\taccompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tclassic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, special\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdyes called indicatorssubstances added to the sample in a titration analysis to permit visual detection of the end point are added to the sample solutions to impart a change in\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence points\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmay also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in a\r\n\t\t\t\t\tpredictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approach\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttaken to detect a titrations equivalence point, the volume of titrant actually\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasured is called the end point. Properly designed titration methods typically\r\n\t\t\t\t\tensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThough any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titration\r\n\t\t\t\t\tanalysis, the three described in this unit (precipitation, acid-base, and redox)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tare most common.

Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The van der Waals Equation,"The ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas\n            molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable\n            part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure\n            and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and\n            deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregardedthis is,\n            however, is not always the case.
In 1879, the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals developed an equation which corrects\n            for the attraction between gas particles and their volume. Under certain conditions of\n            high pressure and low temperatures the deviations from ideal gas law are significant and\n            the van der Waals equation should be used to accurately determine characteristics of a\n            sample of gas.
The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one\n                to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces\n                between them.
The constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a\n            particular gas, and the constant b corresponds to the volume of the molecules of a\n            particular gas. The ccorrectiond to the pressure term in the ideal gas law is\n                (n2a)/v2, and the ccorrectiond to the volume is nb. Note that\n            when V is relatively large and n is relatively small, both of these correction terms\n            become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV =\n            nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules\n            is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure.\n            Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some common gases are given in\n            table below.
At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than\n            the one for molecular volume, b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for\n            the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are\n            incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some\n            intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears\n            to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This\n            behavior is reflected by the cdipsd in the graph seen below that we looked at earlier.\n            The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an\n            ideal gas, as pressure is raised. At very high pressures, the gas becomes less\n            compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly\n            significant fraction of the total gas volume.
Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions\n            between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an\n            appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of\n            low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave\n            ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be\n            disregardedthis is, however, very often not the case.
A 4.25-L flask contains 3.46 mol CO2 at 229 C. Calculate the pressure of\n                this sample of CO2:
(a) from the ideal gas law
$$P = \\frac{nRT}V$$
$$\\require{cancel} P = \\frac{3.46 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}} \\times 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}} \\mathrm{atm} \n                \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}} \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}} \\times 502 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}}}{4.25 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 33.5 \\mathrm{atm}$$
(b) from the van der Waals equation
$$\\left( P + \\frac{n^2a}{V^2} \\right) \\times (V - nb) = nRT \\rightarrow P = \n                \\frac{nRT}{(V - nb)} - \\frac{n^2a}{V^2}$$
$$P = \\frac{3.46 \\mathrm{mol} \\times 0.08206 \\mathrm{L\\ atm\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}} \\times 502 \\mathrm{K}}{\n                (4.25 \\mathrm{L} - 3.46 \\mathrm{mol} \\times 0.0427 \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}})} - \n                \\frac{(3.46 \\mathrm{mol})^2 \\times 3.59 \\mathrm{L^2\\ atm\\ mol^2}}{(4.25 \\mathrm{L})^2}$$
$$P = 32.4 \\mathrm{atm}$$
(c) Explain the reason(s) for the difference.
This is not very different from the value from the ideal gas law because the\n                pressure is not very high and the temperature is not very low. The value is somewhat\n                different because CO2 molecules do have some volume and attractions\n                between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or\n                attractions.

Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Volume and Pressure,"If we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a\n                    specific amount of air at constant temperature, say 25 C. If we slowly push in\n                    the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is\n                    compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the\n                    plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the\n                    effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in\n                    general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure,\n                    and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume\n                    increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and\n                    vice versa.

Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed below.
Unlike the PT and VT relationships, pressure and volume are not directly\n                    proportional to each other. Instead, P and V exhibit inverse proportionality.
The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at\n                    constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher\n                    Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now known as\n                    Boyles lawvolume of a given number of moles of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured: The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is\n                    inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured.
volume of a given number of moles of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured
Boyle\'s law states that the volume of a given amount of gas held at\n                            constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under\n                            which it is measured. Mathematically this can be represented as:
Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when\n                    plotting the inverse of the pressure (1/P) versus the volume (V), or the inverse\n                    of volume (1/V) versus the pressure (P). Graphs with curved lines are\n                    difficult to read accurately at low or high values of the variables, and they\n                    are more difficult to use in fitting theoretical equations and parameters to\n                    experimental data. For those reasons, scientists often try to find a way to\n                    clinearized their data. If we plot P versus V, we obtain a hyperbola as seen\n                    below.
The sample of gas has a volume of 15.0 mL at a pressure of 0.884 atm.\n                        Determine the pressure of the gas at a volume of 7.5 mL.
Because we are looking for the pressure change caused by a volume change at\n                        constant temperature, we will use Boyle\'s law equation.
Identify the variables in the problem.
$$\\begin{array}{l}P_1\\;=\\;0.884\\;atm\\;\\;\\\\\;=\\;15.0\\;mL\\;\\;\\\\\;=\\;?\\;\\;\\\\\;=\\;7.5\\;mL\\end{array}$$

Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,"Extra Practice: Energy, Heat, and Calorimetry",,Aluminum is a common metal used for making kettles. The specific heat of\n                        aluminum is 0.897 J/g oC.
Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Paramagnetism,"For almost every covalent molecule that exists, we can now draw the Lewis structure,\n            predict the electron-pair geometry, predict the molecular geometry, and come close to\n            predicting bond angles. However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen\n            molecule O2, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would\n            write the following Lewis structure for O2:
This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an\n            O=O double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this\n            picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, O2 is not\n            magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past\n            a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as seen\n            in the image below. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it\n            arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of O2\n            indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?
Magnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic\n            field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field\n            (seen in the diagram below), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will\n            appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the\n            number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.
Experiments show that each O2 molecule has two unpaired electrons. The\n            Lewis-structure model does not predict the presence of these two unpaired electrons.\n            Unlike oxygen, the apparent weight of most molecules decreases slightly in the presence\n            of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Materials in which all of the electrons are paired\n            are diamagnetic and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic\n            materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in the presence of an applied magnetic\n            field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion.
Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that\n            accounts for the paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a\n            number of other molecules, such as violations of the octet rule and more molecules with\n            more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are difficult to describe\n            with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of\n            electrons in a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence\n            bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that are assigned to one specific atom, MO\n            theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are\n            delocalized over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent\n            atoms. MO theory also helps us understand why some substances are electrical conductors,\n            others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators. The table below summarizes\n            the main points of the two complementary bonding theories. Both theories provide\n            different, useful ways of describing molecular structure.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Theory,"Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the\n            same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals.\n            Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by\n            a wave function, \xce, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around\n            isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized)\n            energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be\n            found is called a molecular orbital (\xce). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular\n            orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.
We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms\n                (H2 or Cl2, for example). Such molecules are called\n            homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular\n            orbitals occur.
The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is\n            called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the\n            wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic\n            orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which\n            peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with\n            troughs, as seen below. In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine\n            with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and\n            out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.
There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s\n            orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated below. The in-phase\n            combination produces a lower energy \xcfs molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s"") in which\n            most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition\n            (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher\n            energy \xcfs molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s-star"") molecular orbital in which there\n            is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding\n            orbital. Electrons in a \xcfs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are\n            more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons\n            to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these\n            orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the \xcfs orbitals are located well away from the\n            region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these\n            electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding\n            orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy\n            antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill\n            higher-energy atomic orbitals.
In p orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous\n            to how a two-dimensional wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate\n            the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same\n            phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When\n            regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron\n            density and creates nodes. When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create \xcf and \xcf*\n            orbitals. If two atoms are located along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system,\n            the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form \xcfpx (bonding) and \xcfpx (antibonding)\n            (read as ""sigma-p-x"" and ""sigma-p-x star,"" respectively). Just as with s-orbital\n            overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a\n            higher-energy, antibonding orbital.
The side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi (\xcf) bonding molecular\n            orbital and a \xcf* antibonding molecular orbital, as shown below. In valence bond theory,\n            we describe \xcf bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and\n            perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either side of\n            the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the \xcf orbital by this same shape, and\n            a \xcf bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact\n            with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For\n            the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the\n            internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.
In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of p\n            orbitals oriented side by side (py and pz), so these four atomic\n            orbitals combine pairwise to create two \xcf orbitals and two \xcf* orbitals. The \xcfpy and\n                \xcfpy orbitals are oriented at right angles to the \xcfpz and \xcfpz\n            orbitals. Except for their orientation, the \xcfpy and \xcfpz orbitals\n            are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals. The\n                \xcfpy and \xcfpz antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and\n            identical except for their orientation. A total of six molecular orbitals results from\n            the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms: \xcfpx and\n                \xcfpx, \xcfpy and \xcfpy, \xcfpz and\n                \xcfpz.
Predict what type (if any) of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave\n                functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap. The orbitals are all similar in\n                energy.
(a) is an in-phase combination, resulting in a \xcfp orbital
(b) will not result in a new orbital because the in-phase component (bottom) and\n                out-of-phase component (top) cancel out. Only orbitals with the correct alignment\n                can combine.
(c) is an out-of-phase combination, resulting in a \xcfp orbital.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams,"The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a\n            molecular orbital diagram, as seen below. For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of\n            one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each\n            horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular\n            orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center.\n            Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals.\n            For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular\n            orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that\n            combining the six 2p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one \xcf and two \xcf)\n            and three antibonding orbitals (one \xcf* and two \xcf*).
We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the\n            orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle.\n            Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before\n            pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins\n            as seen in the diagram below. Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the\n            molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating\n            the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular\n            orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so\n            parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion\n            containing seven electrons (such as Be2+) would have the molecular electron\n            configuration (\xcfs)2(\xcfs)2(\xcfs)2(\xcfs)1. It is common to omit the core electrons from\n            molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence\n            electrons.
The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both\n                    bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The net contribution of the\n                    electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the\n                    bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by\n                    electrons.
When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in\n                    molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons\n                    between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a\n                    bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order\n                    differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of\n                    electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is\n                    more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but\n                    both methods describe the same phenomenon.
In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction\n                    if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding\n                    interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated\n                    by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing\n                    (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to\n                    get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:
The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given\n                    atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases, as seen in the table below. If the\n                    distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such\n                    that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not\n                    form. We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Bonding in Diatomic Molecules,"A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the\n                    atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular\n                    orbital of lowest energy, the \xcfs bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,\n                        H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule\n                    is lower than that of two H atoms. The \xcfs orbital that contains both\n                    electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.
A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the\n                        H2 molecule are in the \xcfs bonding orbital; the electron\n                    configuration is (\xcfs)2. We represent this configuration\n                    by a molecular orbital energy diagram seen below in which a single upward arrow\n                    indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows\n                    indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons\n                    so we have
Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single\n                    bond.
A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium\n                    atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule, He2, with four\n                    electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the\n                    lower-energy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the\n                    two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital. We would write\n                    the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as\n                        (\xcfs)2(\xcfs)2 as seen in the\n                    diagram below The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force\n                    for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as\n                    discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a\n                    hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero.
A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.
Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the\n                    second period of the periodic table: Li2, Be2,\n                        B2, C2, N2, O2, F2,\n                    and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the\n                        Ne2 molecule would not be stable. We can see this by a\n                    consideration of the molecular electron configurations in the table below.
We predict ground state valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict\n                    electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence\n                    molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hunds\n                    rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons\n                    fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes\n                    place.
As we saw in valence bond theory, \xcf bonds are generally more stable than \xcf bonds\n                    formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory,\n                    \xcf orbitals are usually more stable than \xcf orbitals. However, this is not always\n                    the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in\n                    below. Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is\n                    consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for\n                    atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe\n                    a different pattern, in which the \xcfp orbital is higher in energy than\n                    the \xcfp set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear\n                    diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral\n                    molecule.
This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing.\n                    s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of\n                    the existing molecular orbitals. The \xcfs wavefunction mathematically combines\n                    with the \xcfp wavefunction, with the result that the \xcfs orbital becomes\n                    more stable, and the \xcfp orbital becomes less stable, as seen int the\n                    energy diagram below. Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p\n                    mixing, with the \\(\\sigma_s^\\ast\\) becoming more stable and the \\(\\sigma_p^\\ast\\)\n                    becoming less stable.
s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. The energy\n                    difference between 2s and 2p orbitals in O, F, and Ne is greater than that in\n                    Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and\n                        Ne2 exhibit negligible s-p mixing (not sufficient to change the\n                    energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown\n                    above. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which\n                    leads to the pattern where the \xcfp orbital is raised above the\n                        \xcfp set.
Using the MO diagrams shown, we can add in the electrons and determine the\n                    molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic\n                    molecules. As shown in the table above, Be2 and Ne2\n                    molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.
The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li2,\n                    is analogous to the formation of H2, but the atomic orbitals involved\n                    are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence\n                    electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the \xcfs\n                    bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding\n                    orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule\n                    is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at\n                    temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules\n                    in the table above with a bond order greater than zero are also known.
The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the\n                        (\xcfpy,\xcfpz) level. We expect the two electrons that\n                    occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular\n                    electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the fact that the\n                    oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons, as seen in the energy diagram in the\n                    example below. The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult\n                    to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it\n                    quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a\n                    strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.
Draw the molecular orbital diagram for the oxygen molecule, O2.\n                        From this diagram, calculate the bond order for O2. How does this\n                        diagram account for the paramagnetism of O2?
We draw a molecular orbital energy diagram. Each oxygen atom contributes six\n                        electrons, so the diagram appears as shown below.
We calculate the bond order as
Oxygen\'s paramagnetism is explained by the presence of two unpaired electrons\n                        in the (\xcfpy, \xcfpz)* molecular orbitals.
Give the molecular orbital configuration for the valence electrons in\n                            C22. Will this ion be stable?
Looking at the appropriate MO diagram, we see that the \xcf orbitals are lower\n                        in energy than the \xcfp orbital. The valence electron configuration\n                        for C2 is\n                            (\xcfs)2(\xcfs)2(\xcfpy,\xcfpz)4.\n                        Adding two more electrons to generate the C22 anion will give a\n                        valence electron configuration of\n                            (\xcfs)2(\xcfs)2(\xcfpy,\xcfpz)4(\xcfpx)2.\n                        Since this has six more bonding electrons than antibonding, the bond order\n                        will be 3, and the ion should be stable.

Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Extra Practice: Enthalpy,,
Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two\n                    separate atomic orbitals on different atoms that creates a region with one pair\n                    of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along an\n                    axis containing the nuclei, they form a \xcf bond. When they overlap in a fashion\n                    that creates a node along this axis, they form a \xcf bond.
We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of\n                    the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently\n                    bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (\xcf) bonds directed toward\n                    other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine\n                    the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions\n                    of electron density about it. Two such regions imply sp hybridization; three,\n                        sp2 hybridization; four, sp3 hybridization; five, sp3d\n                    hybridization; and six, sp3d2 hybridization. Pi (\xcf) bonds\n                    are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals).
Multiple bonds consist of a \xcf bond located along the axis between two atoms and\n                    one or two \xcf bonds. The \xcf bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized\n                    atomic orbitals, while the \xcf bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of\n                    unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized\n                    orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of \xcf bonds\n                    can vary.

Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles\n                    called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of\n                    atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms\n                    of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form\n                    compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental\n                    proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of\n                    one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small,\n                    whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor\n                    destroyed.
Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have\n                    demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomsons cathode ray tube showed that\n                    atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan\n                    discovered that there is a fundamental electric chargethe charge of an\n                    electron. Rutherfords gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small,\n                    dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the\n                    nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains\n                    neutral particles called neutrons.
An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.\n                    The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times\n                    smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in\n                    atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is\n                    defined as exactly 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 ×\n                        10 g.
Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073\n                    amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087\n                    amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1 and a mass of 0.00055\n                    amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is\n                    the property that defines an atoms elemental identity. The sum of the numbers\n                    of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed\n                    in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when\n                    it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,Bohr Model of the Atom Calculations,"Bohr postulated that the energy absorbed or emitted when an electron transitioned from\r\n\t\t\tone orbital to another would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to\r\n\t\t\tthis equation:
\r\n\t\t\t$$\\mid\\Delta E\\mid=\\mid E_f\\;-\\;E_i\\mid$$\r\n\t\t
Where E i is the energy of the electron in its initial orbital and E\r\n\t\t\tf is the energy of the electron in its final orbital. Knowing that the\r\n\t\t\tenergies of the orbitals can be calculated with the equation:
\r\n\t\t\t$$E\\;=\\;k\\left(\{n^2}\\right)$$\r\n\t\t
These equations can be combined to calculate the change in energy as an electron\r\n\t\t\ttransitions from one orbital to another.
\r\n\t\t\t$$\\triangle E\\;=\\;k\\;\\left(\{n_f^2}\\;-\\;\{n_i^2}\\right)$$\r\n\t\t
The wavelength and frequency of the energy absorbed or emitted during this\r\n\t\t\ttransition can also be calculated using the equation:
\r\n\t\t\t$$\\triangle E\\;=\\;h\\nu\\;=\\;\\frac{hc}\\lambda$$\r\n\t\t
Calculate the change in energy from the transition of an electron from n = 3 to n = 2.\r\n\t\t\t\tWhat is the wavelength of this emission?
Using the following equation, we can calculate the energy of the transition:

Note that the negative value of \xceE indicates an emission of energy.
Using the following equation we can calculate the wavelength of the energy\r\n\t\t\t\temitted:
\r\n\t\t\t\t$$\\triangle E\\;=\\;\\frac{hc}\\lambda$$\r\n\t\t\t\t$$\\require{cancel}\\lambda\\;=\\;\\frac{(6.626\^{-34}\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm J}\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm s})(2.998\^8\\;\\mathrm m/\\cancel{\\mathrm s})}{3.03\^{-19}\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm J}}\\;=\\;6.56\^{-7}\\;\\mathrm m\\;=\\;656\\;\\mathrm{nm}$$\r\n\t\t\t
Notice that this falls within the wavelength range corresponding to red light. It is this transition from\r\n\t\t\t\tn = 3 to n = 2 that produces the red line on the line spectra of hydrogen.
With the puzzling paradoxes of the photoelectric effect and the hydrogen atom now solved\r\n\t\t\tand all involving Plancks constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to most\r\n\t\t\tphysicists at that time that the classical theories that worked so well in the\r\n\t\t\tmacroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not be extended down into the\r\n\t\t\tmicroscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohrs remarkable\r\n\t\t\tachievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable\r\n\t\t\tto extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohrs\r\n\t\t\tmodel was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion of\r\n\t\t\tprecise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic\r\n\t\t\tdomain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical\r\n\t\t\tmechanics.

Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Module Summary and Quiz,"Matter has thermal energy due to the KE of its molecules and temperature that corresponds\n            to the average KE of its molecules. Heat is energy that is transferred between objects\n            at different temperatures; it flows from a high to a low temperature. Chemical and\n            physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI\n            unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).
Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the\n            temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a\n            substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature\n            change it undergoes.
Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or\n            physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that\n            occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured\n            quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the\n            process using known mathematical relations.
Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between the system being studied\n            and its surroundings. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by\n            introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the\n            energy content of food.

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Single-step Conversions,"Sometimes it is necessary to convert a measurement from one unit to another. For\n            instance, if a measurement is given in miles it may be convenient or necessary to\n            convert it to km or m. Dimensional analysisMethod used to convert from one unit of measure to another. (or factor-label method) is a method used to\n            convert from one unit of measure to another. Dimensional analysis is based on this\n            premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations\n            as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from\n            simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several\n            different quantities.
Method used to convert from one unit of measure to another.
A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be\n            used as a unit conversion factorratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are\n            equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the\n            ratio,
ratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit
Several other commonly used equalities are given in table below.
*Note in the table above, that the English units ounces (oz) and fluid ounces (fl oz) are\n            often both referred to as ounces in everyday use. However, they are distinctly different\n            as oz is a unit of mass and fl oz is a unit of volume.
When we multiply a quantity (such as distance given in inches) by an appropriate unit\n            conversion factor, we convert the quantity to an equivalent value with different units\n            (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball players vertical jump of\n            34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:
When we multiply by the unit factor\n                $$\\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.}$$ we do not change\n            the value of the measurement because 2.54 cm is equivalent to 1 in.
The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit\n                conversion factor derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g.
We can form two conversion factors from the relationship between ounces and\n                grams.
To determine which conversion factor to use to make the conversion, we need to look\n                carefully at the units. Since we are converting from g to oz, we want the unit of g\n                to cancel out. The unit factor that causes the unit of g to cancel is:
Notice that the unit of g cancels, leaving the unit of ounces. Also, notice that the\n                final answer has 3 significant figures because the original measurement has 3\n                significant figures. In this context, the 1 in 1 oz is an exact number and has an\n                infinite number of significant figures.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Electronegativity,"Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding\n            atoms called electronegativitytendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond to itself. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an\n            atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the\n            shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an\n            atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in\n            a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more\n            electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the\n            difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the\n            larger the partial charges of the atoms.
tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond to itself
The periodic table shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one\n            of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling. In general,\n            electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and\n            decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have\n            the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all\n            (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have\n            the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure\n            because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a\n            full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO2 do exist, they can only be\n            formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model\n            of electronegativity.)
We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The\n                    electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the\n                    energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an\n                    electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes\n                    how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity\n                    that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity\n                    values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of\n                    bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4.
The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (\xceEN) of two bonded\n                    atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and,\n                    thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is\n                    covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic.\n                    The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in\n                    the bonds HH, HCl, and NaCl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1\n                    (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms\n                    varies from completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic\n                    bonding). The diagrams below show the relationship between electronegativity\n                    difference and bond type.
A rough approximation of the electronegativity differences associated with\n                    covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds is shown in Figure. This table is just\n                    a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example, the H and F atoms\n                    in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3\n                    a difference of 0.9, yet both of these compounds form bonds that are considered\n                    polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl atoms in NaCl have an electronegativity\n                    difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI2 have a difference\n                    of 1.0, yet both of these substances form ionic compounds.
The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the\n                    types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table.\n                    Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and\n                    a nonmetal is often ionic.
Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds. The atoms in polyatomic\n                    ions, such as OH, NO3, and\n                    NH4+, are held together by polar covalent bonds.\n                    However, these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of\n                    opposite charge. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO3, contains the\n                    K+ cation and the polyatomic NO3 anion.\n                    Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic\n                    attraction between the ions K+ and NO3, as\n                    well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in\n                    NO3.
Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of\n                        proteins. Using the electronegativity values in Figure, arrange the\n                        following covalent bondsall commonly found in amino acidsin order of\n                        increasing polarity. Then designate the positive and negative atoms using\n                        the symbols \xce+ and \xce:
The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the\n                    electronegativity difference increases. The atom with the \xce designation is the\n                    more electronegative of the two. Table shows these bonds in order of increasing\n                    polarity.

To determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can cbuildd\n\t\t\t\t\tthe structures in the order of atomic numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, and\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time\n\t\t\t\t\tto the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described\n\t\t\t\t\tthe electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAufbau principle\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprocedure in which the electron configuration of the elements is\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, adding\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the proper\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsubshell at a time\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t, from the German word Aufbau (cto build upd). Each added electron\n\t\t\t\t\toccupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in the\n\t\t\t\t\tdiagram below), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum\n\t\t\t\t\tnumbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter\n\t\t\t\t\thigher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to\n\t\t\t\t\tcapacity.

Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron\n\t\t\t\t\tconfigurations, the figure below provides an alternative method for determining\n\t\t\t\t\tthe electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and\n\t\t\t\t\tincludes each subshell as you proceed in increasing Z order. For example, after\n\t\t\t\t\tfilling the 3p block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followed\n\t\t\t\t\tby the 3d orbitals.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the electron configuration\n\t\t\t\t\tof an element from the periodic table.
The alkali metal sodium (atomic number 11) has one more electron than the neon\n\t\t\t\t\tatom. This electron must go into the lowest-energy subshell available, the 3s\n\t\t\t\t\torbital, giving a 1s22s22p63s1\n\t\t\t\t\tconfiguration. The electrons occupying the inner shell orbitals are called \n\t\t\t\t\t\tcore electrons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telectron in an atom that occupies the orbitals of the inner\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshells\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t. Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electron\n\t\t\t\t\tconfigurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noble\n\t\t\t\t\tgas that matches the core electron configuration, and then writing the rest of\n\t\t\t\t\tthe electron configuration that represents the outer-shell electrons. The\n\t\t\t\t\touter-shell electrons are very significant in that they contain the \n\t\t\t\t\t\tvalence electrons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\telectrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t of the atom. The valence electrons are those electrons in the outermost\n\t\t\t\t\tshell orbitals of the atom. It is these electrons that heavily contribute to an\n\t\t\t\t\telement\'s properties and they are the electrons involved in chemical bonding.\n\t\t\t\t\tValance electrons will be discussed in more detail later in this course. For our\n\t\t\t\t\tsodium example, the symbol [Ne] represents core electrons,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(1s22s22p6) and our abbreviated or\n\t\t\t\t\tcondensed configuration is [Ne]3s1.

Similarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[He]2s1, where [He] represents the configuration of the helium\n\t\t\t\t\tatom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writing\n\t\t\t\t\tthe configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurations\n\t\t\t\t\tof lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which are in the alkali metal family, have\n\t\t\t\t\tonly one electron in a valence s subshell outside a filled set of inner\n\t\t\t\t\tshells.
Li: [He]2s1
Na: [Ne]3s1
The alkaline earth metal magnesium (atomic number 12), with its 12 electrons in a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[Ne]3s2 configuration, is analogous to its family member\n\t\t\t\t\tberyllium, [He]2s2. Both atoms have a filled s subshell outside their\n\t\t\t\t\tfilled inner shells. Aluminum (atomic number 13), with 13 electrons and the\n\t\t\t\t\telectron configuration [Ne]3s23p1, is analogous to its\n\t\t\t\t\tfamily member boron, [He]2s22p1.
The electron configurations of silicon (14 electrons), phosphorus (15 electrons),\n\t\t\t\t\tsulfur (16 electrons), chlorine (17 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) are\n\t\t\t\t\tanalogous in the electron configurations of their outer shells to their\n\t\t\t\t\tcorresponding family members carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon,\n\t\t\t\t\trespectively, except that the principal quantum number of the outer shell of the\n\t\t\t\t\theavier elements has increased by one to n = 3. Figure shows the lowest energy,\n\t\t\t\t\tor ground-state, electron configuration for these elements as well as that for\n\t\t\t\t\tatoms of each of the known elements.
When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metal\n\t\t\t\t\tpotassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to add\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons to the 3d subshell. However, all available chemical and physical\n\t\t\t\t\tevidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next\n\t\t\t\t\telectron is not added to the 3d level but is, instead, added to the 4s level.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe 3d orbital with no radial nodes and is higher in energy because it is less\n\t\t\t\t\tpenetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s, which has three\n\t\t\t\t\tradial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[Ar]4s1. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valence\n\t\t\t\t\tshell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s subshell and\n\t\t\t\t\tcalcium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s2. This gives calcium\n\t\t\t\t\tan outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium and\n\t\t\t\t\tmagnesium.
Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additional\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons are added successively to the 3d subshell. This subshell is filled to\n\t\t\t\t\tits capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for l = 2 [d orbitals], there are\n\t\t\t\tl + 1 = 5 values of ml, meaning that there are five d orbitals that\n\t\t\t\t\thave a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4p subshell fills next. Note that\n\t\t\t\t\tfor three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y)\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 d\n\t\t\t\t\telectrons are successively added to the (n  1) shell next to the n shell to\n\t\t\t\t\tbring that (n  1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La)\n\t\t\t\t\tthrough lutetium (Lu) and actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr), 14 f electrons\n\t\t\t\t\t(l = 3, 2l + 1 = 7 mlvalues; thus, seven orbitals with a combined\n\t\t\t\t\tcapacity of 14 electrons) are successively added to the (n  2) shell to bring\n\t\t\t\t\tthat shell from 18 electrons to a total of 32 electrons.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the abbreviated electron\n\t\t\t\t\tconfiguration from the periodic table.
Thus far, we have looked at electron configurations for ground state atoms.\n\t\t\t\t\tElectron configurations for excited atoms can also be represented. If the\n\t\t\t\t\telectron configuration represents an excited atom, it will not follow the\n\t\t\t\t\tsequence we have looked at for ground state atoms.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Determination of Empirical Formulas,"As previously mentioned, the most common approach\r\n\t\t\tto determining a compounds chemical formula is to first measure the masses of its\r\n\t\t\tconstituent elements. However, we must keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the\r\n\t\t\trelative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally\r\n\t\t\tderived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in\r\n\t\t\tthe compound. To accomplish this, we can use molar masses to convert the mass of each\r\n\t\t\telement to a number of moles. We then consider the moles of each element relative to\r\n\t\t\teach other, converting these numbers into a whole-number ratio that can be used to\r\n\t\t\tderive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined\r\n\t\t\tto contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H. The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles)\r\n\t\t\tare:
Thus, we can accurately represent this compound\r\n\t\t\twith the formula C 0.142 H 0.248 . Of course, per accepted\r\n\t\t\tconvention, formulas contain whole-number subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing\r\n\t\t\teach mol amount by the smaller of the two.
This gives us the whole number ratio of C:H\r\n\t\t\tatoms in the compound as 1:2 or CH2\r\n\t\t
The empirical formula for this compound is thus CH2.\r\n\t\t\t\t This may or not be the compounds molecular formula as well; however,\r\n\t\t\twe would need additional information to make that determination (as discussed later in\r\n\t\t\tthis section).
The process for determining the formula for an\r\n\t\t\tempirical formula are summarized in the steps below.
Convert the given amount of each\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telement into moles.
Divide each mole amount by the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmallest of the mole values.
If step 2 does not produce whole\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnumbers (or very close to it), find a multiple of all of the values that\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproduces all whole numbers.
Write the chemical formula based\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the whole number ratio of atoms in the compound.
Consider as another example a sample of\r\n\t\t\t\tcompound determined to contain 5.31 g Cl and 8.40 g O. What is\r\n\t\t\t\tthe empirical formula for this compound?
Convert to moles.
Divide each mole value by the smallest of the\r\n\t\t\t\tvalues.
Notice this step of the process in\r\n\t\t\t\tthis example did not yield a whole number ratio.
Find a multiple of the values that yields a\r\n\t\t\t\twhole number ratio.
Multiplying both mole values by 2 yields the\r\n\t\t\t\twhole number ratio 2:7.
Write the chemical formula.
Finally, with regard to deriving empirical\r\n\t\t\t\t\tformulas, consider instances in which a compounds percent composition is\r\n\t\t\t\t\tavailable rather than the absolute masses of the compounds constituent\r\n\t\t\t\t\telements. In such cases, the percent composition can be used to calculate the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmasses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these masses can\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthen be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.
The bacterial fermentation of grain to produce\r\n\t\t\t\tethanol forms a gas with a percent composition of 27.29% C and 72.71% O. What is the\r\n\t\t\t\tempirical formula for this gas?
Since the scale for percentages is 100, it is\r\n\t\t\t\tmost convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100\r\n\t\t\t\tg. The calculation is cmost convenientd because, per the definition for percent\r\n\t\t\t\tcomposition, the mass of a given element in grams is numerically equivalent to the\r\n\t\t\t\telements mass percentage. This numerical equivalence results from the definition of\r\n\t\t\t\tthe cpercentaged unit, whose name is derived from the Latin phrase per centum\r\n\t\t\t\tmeaning cby the hundred.d Considering this definition, the mass percentages provided\r\n\t\t\t\tmay be more conveniently expressed as fractions:
The molar amounts of carbon and hydrogen in a\r\n\t\t\tg sample are calculated by dividing each elements mass by its molar mass:
Coefficients for the tentative empirical\r\n\t\t\t\tformula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of the two:
Since the resulting ratio is one carbon to two\r\n\t\t\t\toxygen atoms, the empirical formula is:

Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Module Summary and Quiz,"If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused\n                    by expansion or contraction, q for the change is called the enthalpy change with the\n                    symbol \xceH, or \xceH for reactions occurring under standard state\n                    conditions. The value of \xceH for a reaction in one direction is\n                    equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to \xceH for the reaction\n                    in the opposite direction, and \xceH is directly proportional to\n                    the quantity of reactants and products.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Exceptions to the Octet Rule,"While most central atoms of molecules and polyatomic ions have eight electrons, some have\n            central atoms that do not have an octet of electrons in their Lewis structures. These\n            molecules fall into three categories:
First we will consider hypervalent molecules. These are the most common of the exceptions\n            and will be important to understand for our discussion in the next module.
Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n =\n                    2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because\n                    they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three\n                        2p orbitals).
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 2nd period, C, N, O, and F do NOT exceed\n                    an octet.
Elements in the third and higher periods (n  3) have\n                    their valence electrons in the 3rd period or higher. These shells include a d\n                    subshell and allow atoms in the 3rd period or higher to accommodate more than an\n                    octet of electrons.
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 3rd period or higher, while they usually\n                    form an octet, can exceed an octet of electrons. Molecules formed from these\n                    elements are called hypervalent molecules. The Lewis structures below show two\n                    hypervalent molecules, SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, which is used as an\n                    insulating gas in the electrical industry, but is a potent greenhouse gas.
In some hypervalent molecules, such as XeF4, xenon tetrafluoride which \n                    was the first binary compound of a noble gas, some of the electrons in\n                    the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs:
When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have\n                    electrons left over after filling the valence shells of the outer atoms with\n                    eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central\n                    atom.
Determine the Lewis structure for phosphorus pentachloride,\n                        PCl5, which is an important chlorinating agent in organic and inorganic synthesis. .
As before, we need to calculate the number of valence electrons that will be\n                        represented in the Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central P atom to the terminal Cl atoms to\n                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more\n                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal\n                        atoms first.
The Lewis structure now shows all 40 valence electrons in the molecule and is\n                        therefore complete.
Determine the Lewis structure for iodine pentafluoride, IF5, a fluorinating agent.
Calculate the number of valence electrons that will be represented in the\n                        Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central I atom to the terminal F atoms to\n                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more\n                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal\n                        atoms first.
The structure with the octets of the terminal atoms complete shows 40\n                        electrons. There are still 2 electrons to incorporate into the structure.\n                        These additional electrons are added to the central atom.
Now the structure shows all 42 electrons. Note that no additional electrons\n                        can be added to the F atoms because F is in the 2nd period and cannot exceed\n                        an octet of electrons.
We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not\n                    have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms\n                    from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not\n                    form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium\n                    dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium\n                    and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is\n                    possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a\n                    fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental\n                    evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for BF single\n                    bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three BF single bonds and an\n                    electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with\n                    an electron deficient boron. However, the BF bonds are slightly shorter than\n                    what is actually expected for BF single bonds, indicating that some double bond\n                    character is found in the actual molecule.
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight\n                    electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an\n                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with\n                        BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the\n                    boron atom:
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals.\n                            Nitric oxide, NO a biological signaling molecule, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is\n                            produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react\n                            at high temperatures. Odd electron molecules are very rare and cannot\n                            achieve full octets of electrons around atoms because of the odd number\n                            of electrons. The two possible Lewis structures for NO are seen\n                            below. Based on formal charge, the left structure is more plausible than the right structure.

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Hydrogen Bonding,"Nitrosyl fluoride (ONF, molecular mass 49 amu) is a gas at room temperature. Water\n                (H2O, molecular mass 18 amu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower\n            molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to\n            dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and\n            larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion\n            forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to\n            differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit\n            comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a\n            particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a\n            hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most\n            electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H\n            atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or\n            3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively\n            small sizes of F, O, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these\n            atoms. Molecules with F-H, O-H, or N-H moieties are very strongly attracted to similar\n            moieties in nearby molecules, a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole attraction\n            called hydrogen bonding. Examples of hydrogen bonds include HFb\xafHF, H2Ob\xafHOH,\n            and H3Nb, in which the hydrogen bonds are denoted by dots.\n            The video below illustrates hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
Despite use of the word cbond,d keep in mind that hydrogen bonds are intermolecular\n            attractive forces, not intramolecular attractive forces (covalent bonds). Hydrogen bonds\n            are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about 5 to 10% as strong, but are generally\n            much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.
Hydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids\n            and solids). For example, consider the trends in boiling points for the binary hydrides\n            of group 15 (NH3, PH3, AsH3, and SbH3),\n            group 16 hydrides (H2O, H2S, H2Se, and\n            H2Te), and group 17 hydrides (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI), as discussed in the\n            slide show below.
Consider the compounds dimethylether (CH3OCH3), ethanol\n                    (CH3CH2OH), and propane\n                    (CH3CH2CH3). Their boiling points, not\n                necessarily in order, are .1 C, .8 C, and 78.4 C. Match each compound with\n                its boiling point. Explain your reasoning.
The VSEPR-predicted shapes of CH3OCH3,\n                    CH3CH2OH, and CH3CH2CH3\n                are similar, as are their molar masses (46 g/mol, 46 g/mol, and 44 g/mol,\n                respectively), so they will exhibit similar dispersion forces. Since CH3CH2CH3 is\n                nonpolar, it may exhibit only dispersion forces. Because\n                    CH3OCH3 is polar, it will also experience dipole-dipole\n                attractions. Finally, CH3CH2OH has an OH group, and so it\n                will experience the uniquely strong dipole-dipole attraction known as hydrogen\n                bonding. So the ordering in terms of strength of IMFs, and thus boiling points, is\n                    CH3CH2CH3 < CH3OCH3\n                < CH3CH2OH. The boiling point of propane is .1 C, the\n                boiling point of dimethylether is .8 C, and the boiling point of ethanol is 78.5\n                C.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ion Formation,"In ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the\n            element) remains unchanged. Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from\n            other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer\n            and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the\n            formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged\n            particles called ions.
Click ""NEXT"" to progress the slideshow
When atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give\n            them the same number of electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic\n            table. Atoms of group 17 gain one electron and form anions with a 1 charge; atoms of\n            group 16 gain two electrons and form ions with a 2 charge, and so on.
Click ""NEXT"" to progress the slideshow
Note the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge.\n            Moving from the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to\n            form cations with a charge equal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form 1+\n            ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on\n            the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the\n            number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one\n            group left of the noble gases) form 1 ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2\n            ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive\n            value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition\n            metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by\n            their location in the table. For example, copper can form ions with a 1+ or 2+ charge,\n            and iron can form ions with a 2+ or 3+ charge.
In many situations an atom will gain or lose electrons so that it has the same number of\n            electrons as the noble gas to which it is nearest. As we saw in the examples, magnesium\n            lost 2 electrons to obtain the same number of electrons as neon and fluorine gained 1\n            electron so that it had the same number of electrons as neon.

Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"The kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very effective model that\n                    effectively explains ideal gas behavior. The theory assumes that gases consist\n                    of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion,\n                    colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with\n                    average velocities determined by their absolute temperatures. The individual\n                    molecules of a gas exhibit a range of velocities, the distribution of these\n                    velocities being dependent on the temperature of the gas and the mass of its\n                    molecules.
Gaseous atoms and molecules move freely and randomly through space. Diffusion is\n                    the process whereby gaseous atoms and molecules are transferred from regions of\n                    relatively high concentration to regions of relatively low concentration.\n                    Effusion is a similar process in which gaseous species pass from a container to\n                    a vacuum through very small orifices. The rates of effusion of gases are\n                    inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities or to the square\n                    roots of their atoms/molecules masses (Grahams law).
Gas molecules possess a finite volume and experience forces of attraction for one\n                    another. Consequently, gas behavior is not necessarily described well by the\n                    ideal gas law. Under conditions of low pressure and high temperature, these\n                    factors are negligible, the ideal gas equation is an accurate description of gas\n                    behavior, and the gas is said to exhibit ideal behavior. However, at lower\n                    temperatures and higher pressures, corrections for molecular volume and\n                    molecular attractions are required to account for finite molecular size and\n                    attractive forces. The van der Waals equation is a modified version of the ideal\n                    gas law that can be used to account for the non-ideal behavior of gases under\n                    these conditions.

Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Liquids in Liquids,"We know that some liquids mix with each other in all proportions; in other words, they\n            have infinite mutual solubility and are said to be miscible. Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and\n            ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze) are examples of liquids that are\n            completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline.
Liquids that mix with water in all proportions are usually polar substances or substances\n            that form hydrogen bonds. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen\n            bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as\n            those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds\n            of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because\n            there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent,\n            and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in\n            polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration\n            of the chemical axiom clike dissolves like.d
Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible.\n                    Layers are formed when we pour immiscible liquids into the same container.\n                    Gasoline, oil, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other\n                    nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. The attraction between the molecules\n                    of such nonpolar liquids and polar water molecules is ineffectively weak. The\n                    only strong attractions in such a mixture are between the water molecules, so\n                    they effectively squeeze out the molecules of the nonpolar liquid. The\n                    distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of degrees, so\n                    that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to\n                    be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility.
Two liquids, such as bromine and water, that are of moderate mutual solubility are said\n            to be partially miscible. Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when\n            mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated\n            with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is\n            nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly\n            discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water\n            in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine\n            layer.

Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Moles of Gas and Volume,"The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to account\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfor the behavior of gases, stating that equal volumes of all gases, measured\r\n\t\t\t\t\tunder the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental\r\n\t\t\t\t\tobservations.
Avogadros lawvolume of a gas at constant temperature and pressure is proportional to the number of gas molecules states: for a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure and temperature both\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tremain constant.
volume of a gas at constant temperature and pressure is proportional to the number of gas molecules
In equation form, this is written as:
An expandable balloon contains 2.5 mol of helium gas and has a volume of 1.2\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tL. If the temperature and pressure remain constant and 1.5 mol of additional\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\thelium is added to the balloon, what will the new volume be?

Reactions and Stoichiometry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemical Reactions and Equations,Oxidation-Reduction: Oxidation States,"Earths atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O2, a chemically\n            reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in\n            many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidationprocess in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons\n             was originally\n            used to describe chemical reactions involving O2, but its meaning has evolved\n            to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox)\n            reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of\n            this classification.
process in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons\n
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield\n            ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium\n            chloride:
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to\n            represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a\n            half-reaction:
These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl2\n            molecule) gain electrons, the csd subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are\n            present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the\n            loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:
In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes reductionprocess in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons\n        . Viewed from\n            a more active perspective, sodium functions as a reducing agent(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized (reductant), since it\n            provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an\n            oxidizing agent(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes)\n            sodium.
process in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons\n
(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized
(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for\n            example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the\n            explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the\n            previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called\n            oxidation number has been defined. The oxidation numberthe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic (or oxidation statethe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic) of an\n            element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic.\n            The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a\n            molecule or ion.
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals\n                    the charge on the molecule or ion.
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first,\n                    followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the\n                    reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to\n                    emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.
Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all\n                the elements in the following species:
a) H2S
b) SO32
c) SO42-
The oxidation number for H is +1.
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the\n                charge on the molecule or ion.
Since the oxidation state of H is +1 and there are 2 hydrogen atoms in this compound,\n                in order to obtain an overall charge of zero, we assign  for the oxidation state\n                of the sulfur.
The oxidation number for each oxygen in this situation, as it is in most, is .
The overall charge of the monatomic ion is .
The oxidation number for each oxygen in this situation, as it is in most, is .

Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Units of Solution Concentration: Parts per Million and Parts per Billion,"Very low solute concentrations are often expressed using appropriately small units such\n            as parts per million (ppm)ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 106 or parts per billion (ppb)ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 109. Like percentage (cpart per\n            hundredd) units, ppm and ppb may be defined in terms of masses, volumes, or mixed\n            mass-volume units. There are also ppm and ppb units defined with respect to numbers of\n            atoms and molecules.
ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 106
ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 109
The mass-based definitions of ppm and ppb are given here:
Both ppm and ppb are convenient units for reporting the concentrations of pollutants and\n            other trace contaminants in water. Concentrations of these contaminants are typically\n            very low in treated and natural waters, and their levels cannot exceed relatively low\n            concentration thresholds without causing adverse effects on health and wildlife. For\n            example, the EPA has identified the maximum safe level of fluoride ion in tap water to\n            be 4 ppm. Inline water filters are designed to reduce the concentration of fluoride and\n            several other trace-level contaminants in tap water.
According to the EPA, when the concentration of lead in tap water reaches 15 ppb,\n                certain remedial actions must be taken. What is this concentration in ppm? At this\n                concentration, what mass of lead (\xce\xbcg) would be contained in a typical glass of water\n                (300 mL)?
The definitions of the ppm and ppb units may be used to convert the given\n                concentration from ppb to ppm. Comparing these two unit definitions shows that ppm\n                is 1000 times greater than ppb (1 ppm = 103 ppb). Thus:
The definition of the ppb unit may be used to calculate the requested mass if the\n                mass of the solution is provided. However, only the volume of solution (300 mL) is\n                given, so we must use the density to derive the corresponding mass. We can assume\n                the density of tap water to be roughly the same as that of pure water (~1.00 g/mL),\n                since the concentrations of any dissolved substances should not be very large.\n                Rearranging the equation defining the ppb unit and substituting the given quantities\n                yields:
Finally, convert this mass to the requested unit of micrograms:

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Module Summary and Quiz,"Electron configurations allow us to understand many periodic trends. Covalent\n                    radius increases as we move down a group because the n level (orbital size)\n                    increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a\n                    period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons\n                    increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii\n                    are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the\n                    number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained\n                    constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation)\n                    decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier\n                    to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity\n                    (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic)\n                    when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus.\n                    Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to\n                    right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group. For both\n                    IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends when dealing\n                    with completely filled or half-filled subshells.

Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Module Summary and Quiz,"Phase transitions are processes that convert matter from one physical state into another.\n            There are six phase transitions between the three phases of matter. Melting,\n            vaporization, and sublimation are all endothermic processes, requiring an input of heat\n            to overcome intermolecular attractions. The reciprocal transitions of freezing,\n            condensation, and deposition are all exothermic processes, involving heat as\n            intermolecular attractive forces are established or strengthened. The temperatures at\n            which phase transitions occur are determined by the relative strengths of intermolecular\n            attractions and are, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of the substance.
The temperature and pressure conditions at which a substance exists in solid, liquid, and\n            gaseous states are summarized in a phase diagram for that substance. Phase diagrams are\n            combined plots of three pressure-temperature equilibrium curves: solid-liquid,\n            liquid-gas, and solid-gas. These curves represent the relationships between\n            phase-transition temperatures and pressures. The point of intersection of all three\n            curves represents the substances triple pointthe temperature and pressure at which all\n            three phases are in equilibrium. At pressures below the triple point, a substance cannot\n            exist in the liquid state, regardless of its temperature. The terminus of the liquid-gas\n            curve represents the substances critical point, the pressure and temperature above\n            which a liquid phase cannot exist.

Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,X-Ray Crystallography,"The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of\n            atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by\n            the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of\n            travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier\n            whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are\n            electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between\n            neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few angstroms (1  = 1 \n            10 m)).
When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a\n            crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When\n            scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo\n            interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a\n            decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining\n            waves maxima are separated as shown below.
Light waves occupying the same space\n                experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b)\n                intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and\n                minima.
When X-rays of a certain wavelength, \xce\xbb, are\n            scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, d, they may\n            undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by\n            the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength.\n            This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, \xce, is related to the\n            wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:
$$n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\\theta$$
This relation is known as the Bragg equation in\n            honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. The\n            illustration below shows two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal\n            planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in\n            constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different\n            angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive\n            interference.
The diffraction of X-rays scattered by\n                the atoms within a crystal permits the determination of the distance between the\n                atoms. The top image depicts constructive interference between two scattered\n                waves and a resultant diffracted wave of high intensity. The bottom image\n                depicts destructive interference and a low intensity diffracted\n                wave.
An X-ray diffractometer, such as the one\n            illustrated below, may be used to measure the angles at which X-rays are diffracted when\n            interacting with a crystal as described earlier. From such measurements, the Bragg\n            equation may be used to compute distances between atoms as demonstrated in the following\n            example exercise.
(a) In a diffractometer, a beam of\n                X-rays strikes a crystalline material, producing (b) an X-ray diffraction\n                pattern that can be analyzed to determine the crystal structure.
In a diffractometer, X-rays with a wavelength\n                of 0.1315 nm were used to produce a diffraction pattern for copper. The first order\n                diffraction (n = 1) occurred at an angle \xce = 25.25. Determine the spacing between\n                the diffracting planes in copper.
The distance between the planes is found by\n                solving the Bragg equation, \\(n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\\theta\\), for d.
This gives:

Reactions and Stoichiometry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Redox Equations in Acidic Solutions,"In this section, we will concentrate on the half-reaction method for balancing\n            oxidation-reduction reactions. The use of half-reactions is important for balancing more\n            complicated reactions and partly because many aspects of electrochemistry, which will be\n            discussed later in the course, are easier to discuss in terms of half-reactions. The\n            half-reaction method splits oxidation-reduction reactions into their oxidation chalfd\n            and reduction chalfd to make finding the overall equation easier.
Electrochemical reactions frequently occur in solutions, which could be acidic, basic, or\n            neutral. When balancing oxidation-reduction reactions, the nature of the solution may be\n            important. On this page, we will look at how to balance an oxidation-reduction reaction\n            in acidic solution.
Consider the following unbalanced oxidation-reduction reaction in acidic solution:
Each half-reaction contains the same element in two different oxidation states. The\n                Fe2+ has lost an electron to become Fe3+; therefore, the iron\n            underwent oxidation. The reduction is not as obvious; however, the manganese gained five\n            electrons to change from Mn7+ (in MnO4-) to\n                Mn2+.
The iron atoms in the oxidation half-reaction are balanced (mass balance); however, the\n            charge is unbalanced, since the charges on the ions are not equal. Adding a single\n            electron on the right side gives a balanced oxidation half-reaction:
The elements of the reduction half-reaction are not balanced. We must add 4 H2O to the\n            right side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms and we then add 8 H+ ions to the\n            left side of the equation to balance the hydrogen.
The atoms are balanced (mass balance), so it is now necessary to check for charge\n            balance. The total charge on the left of the reaction arrow is [()  (1) + (8) \n            (+1)], or +7, while the total charge on the right side is [(1)  (+2) + (4)  (0)], or\n            +2. The difference between +7 and +2 is five; therefore, it is necessary to add five\n            electrons to the left side to achieve charge balance.
We now have two balanced half-reactions.
The number of electrons transferred from the oxidation half-reaction to the reduction\n            half-reaction must be equal. In this example, it is necessary to multiply every term in\n            the oxidation half-reaction by five. The multiplication of the two half-reactions by the\n            appropriate factor followed by addition of the two halves gives
The electrons do not appear in the final answer because the oxidation electrons are the\n            same electrons as the reduction electrons and they ccancel.d
Balance the following reaction equation in acidic solution:
In acidic solution, we can use or generate hydrogen ions (H+).\n                                Adding seven water molecules to the left side provides the necessary\n                                oxygen; the cleft overd hydrogen appears as 14 H+ on the right:
The left side of the equation\n                                has a total charge of [2  (+3) = +6], and the right side a total\n                                charge of [ + 14  (+1) = +12]. The difference is six; adding six\n                                electrons to the right side produces a mass- and charge-balanced\n                                oxidation half-reaction (in acidic solution):
It is necessary to convert the four oxygen atoms in the\n                                permanganate into four water molecules. To do this, add eight H+ to\n                                convert the oxygen into four water molecules:
Add five electrons to the left\n                                side to balance the charge.
The least common multiple for the electrons is 30, so multiply the oxidation\n                half-reaction by five, the reduction half-reaction by six.

Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as\n            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,\n            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of\n            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying\n            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the\n            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which\n            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different\n            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the\n            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class\n            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate\n            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a\n            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small\n            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous\n                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a\n                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do\n                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of\n                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.\n                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:\n                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by\n                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to\n            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures\n            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds\n            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than\n            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are\n                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air\n                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,\n            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to\n            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are\n            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and\n            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and\n            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a\n            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution\n            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise\n            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically\n            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or\n            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.\n            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid\n            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given\n            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of\n            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.\n            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger\n                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large\n                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller\n                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules\n                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact\n            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,\n            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal\n            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are\n            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a\n            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or\n            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,\n            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be\n            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an\n            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large\n            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying\n            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a\n            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of\n            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise\n            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by\n            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,\n            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water\n            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce\n            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they\n            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical\n            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a\n            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of\n            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,\n            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:
$$\\mathrm{Au}^{3+}+3\\mathrm\n            e^-\\longrightarrow\\mathrm{Au}$$
Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact\n            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of\n            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems"

Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Colloids,"Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly\n            basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from\n            wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain\n            carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or\n            sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic\n            acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic\n            acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and\n            contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35\n            unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the  CO2 unit (shown below).
Soaps contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon\n                end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end is a carboxylate group. The\n                length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from soap to soap.
Detergents (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar\n            hydrocarbon chains, such as C12H25, and an ionic group, such as a\n            sulfate, or a sulfonate (such\n            as the detergent shown below). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium compounds in\n            hard water; detergents form water-soluble productsa definite advantage for\n            detergents.
Detergents contain a nonpolar\n                hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a\n                sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from\n                detergent to detergent.
The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be\n            explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon\n            (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,\n            nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted\n            by water (polar), illustrated in the following figure. As a result, the soap or\n            detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the\n            water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar\n            and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a\n            hydrophobic (cwater-fearingd) part and a hydrophilic (cwater-lovingd) part. As a\n            consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily\n            washed away.
This diagrammatic cross section of an\n                emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent acts as an\n                emulsifier.
Dispersed colloidal particles are often\n            electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not\n            contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the\n            iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and\n            the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide\n            ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have\n            positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged\n            dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign.\n            This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each\n            other.
The charged nature of some colloidal particles may\n            be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For example, the particles\n            comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick\n            Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The\n            charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized\n            and deposited as dust, such as in the Cottrell precipitator shown below. This is one of\n            the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes.\n            The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and\n            flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air\n            filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.
In a Cottrell precipitator, positively\n                and negatively charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes,\n                where they are neutralized and deposited as dust.
Gelatin desserts, such as Jell-O, are a type of\n            colloid. Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates\n            as it cools, yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal\n            dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a solid phase. It appears that the fibers of the\n            dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled\n            with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium.
Gelatin desserts are colloids in which\n                an aqueous solution of sweeteners and flavors is dispersed throughout a medium\n                of solid proteins. (credit photo: modification of work by Steven\n                Depolo)
Pectin, a carbohydrate from fruit juices, is a\n            gel-forming substance important in jelly making. Silica gel, a colloidal dispersion of\n            hydrated silicon dioxide, is formed when dilute hydrochloric acid is added to a dilute\n            solution of sodium silicate. Canned Heat is a flammable gel made by mixing alcohol and a\n            saturated aqueous solution of calcium acetate.",

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron\n                    configurations. The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may\n                    be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of\n                    these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron\n                    shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily\n                    determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to\n                    fill their valence shells.
Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by\n                    the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared\n                    equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one\n                    atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The\n                    ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called\n                    its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms\n                    determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical\n                    atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or\n                    pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the\n                    case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Colligative Properties of Electrolytes,"As noted previously in this module, the colligative properties of a solution depend only\n            on the number, not on the kind, of solute species dissolved.

However, 1 mole of sodium\n            chloride (an electrolyte) forms 2 moles of ions when dissolved in solution. Each\n            individual ion produces the same effect on the freezing point as a single molecule\n            does.
The concentration of ions in seawater is approximately the same as that in a solution\n                containing 4.2 g of NaCl dissolved in 125 g of water. Assume that each of the ions\n                in the NaCl solution has the same effect on the freezing point of water as a\n                nonelectrolyte molecule, and determine the freezing temperature the solution (which\n                is approximately equal to the freezing temperature of seawater).
Convert from grams to moles of NaCl using the molar mass of NaCl in the unit\n                conversion factor.
Determine the number of moles of ions present in the solution using the number of\n                moles of ions in 1 mole of NaCl as the conversion factor (2 mol ions/1 mol\n                NaCl).
Determine the molality of the ions in the solution from the number of moles of ions\n                and the mass of solvent, in kilograms.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal\n                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.
Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the\n                change.
Assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0 m aqueous solution of NaCl contains 2.0 mole of\n            ions (1.0 mol Na+ and 1.0 mol Cl) per each kilogram of water, and\n            its freezing point depression is expected to be
When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured,\n            however, a value of 3.4 C is obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other\n            ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured and expected colligative\n            property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase.\n            These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong\n            electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in solution.
To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total\n            dissociation, an experimentally measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning\n            German chemist Jacobus Henricus vant Hoff is used. The vant Hoff factor (i) is defined\n            as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units\n            dissolved:
Values for measured vant Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values\n            assuming complete dissociation, are shown in the table below.
In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich H\xbcckel proposed a theory to explain the\n            apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although\n            interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the\n            ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The\n            residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles.\n          In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a\n            solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of\n            any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions\n            become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual\n            interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the\n            effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the\n            actual concentrations. Note that the vant Hoff factors for the electrolytes in the table above\n            are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of i for NaCl is 1.9, as\n            opposed to an ideal value of 2.

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Multi-step Conversions,"Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex\n            problems involving computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the\n            sameall the factors involved in the calculation must be appropriately oriented to\n            insure that their labels (units) will appropriately cancel and/or combine to yield the\n            desired unit in the result. This is why it is referred to as the factor-label method. As\n            your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this\n            approach.
Let\'s look at a couple of examples that are a bit more complex
Amanda is 64 inches tall. What is her height in meters?
Notice that on our list of conversion factors there is no direct conversion from\n                inches to meters. We will take a two-step approach first converting in. to cm and\n                then cm to m.
One method of using dimensional analysis is to enter the units for the conversion\n                first and then add in the values. This activity will take you through this\n                approach.
Your gas tank has a volume of 17.5 gal. What is this measurement in mL?
Since we do not have a direct conversion factor from gal to mL we will go through the\n                following steps to make this conversion.
Convert 22,500 inches to kilometers. Round your final answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Based on conversion factors that we know we will take the following steps to make this\n                conversion:
Based on these steps, fill in the conversion factors below.
Let\'s say you want to convert from m to ft. You know that 1 m = 3.2808 ft.\n                    However, this is a unit of length and not a unit of area so we cannot use this\n                    conversion factor as is.
If we look at the square above that measures 1 meter by 1 meter, to find the area\n                    we multiply length times width.
Making conversions involving cubed units of volume is similar. Let\'s say you\n                    want to convert from in3 to cm3. You know that 1 in. = 2.54 cm. However, this is\n                    a unit of length not volume so this unit cannot be used directly.
If we look at the cube above that measures 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch, to find\n                    the volume we multiply length times width times height.
Your friend that lives in Spain tells you that his new apartment is\n                            55m2. You want to convert the value to ft2 because\n                        that is the unit of area that you are most familiar with. You know that 1 m\n                        = 3.2808 ft.
Your friend\'s apartment is 590 square feet.
The volume of a swimming pool is 375,000 dm3. Convert this volume\n                        to m3.
You know that 1 m = 10 dm. Therefore 1 m3 = (10\n                        dm)3.

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t,Module Summary and Quiz,"Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a\n                    constant speed, c, of 2.998 ms-1. This radiation\n                    shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, \xce\xbd, and a\n                    wavelength, \xce\xbb, such that c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through\n                    two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the\n                    wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive\n                    and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also\n                    demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is\n                    related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as\n                    E = h\xce\xbd (or E = hc/\xce\xbb ), where h is Planck\'s constant. That light demonstrates\n                    both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All\n                    forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various\n                    forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact\n                    differently with matter and have very different practical applications.
Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies,\n                    such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent\n                    sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). The\n                    line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from an\n                    electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple\n                    enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived\n                    from the spectrum.
Bohr incorporated Plancks and Einsteins quantization ideas into a model of the\n                    hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra.\n                    The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the\n                    quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described\n                    the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a\n                    nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits\n                    characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits\n                    result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a\n                    higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a\n                    photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon\n                    of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of\n                    an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Energy of Covalent Bonds,"Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the\n            strength of a covalent bond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy\n            necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of bonded atoms requires\n            energy. The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it.
The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is\n            called the bond energy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic\n            molecule, DXY, is defined as the standard enthalpy change for the\n            endothermic reaction:
For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent HH bond, DHH, is 436 kJ\n            per mole of HH bonds broken:
Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies\n            in such a molecule is equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction\n            that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example, the sum of the four CH bond\n            energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the\n            reaction:
The average CH bond energy, DCH, is \n            $$\\frac{1660\\;\\mathrm{kJ}}{4\\;\\mathrm{mols}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{bonds}}\\;=\\;415\\;{\\textstyle\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{mol}}}$$\n            because there are\n            four moles of CH bonds broken per mole of the reaction. Although the four CH bonds are\n            equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break;\n            once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining bonds are\n            easier to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to\n            break any one bond.
The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the\n            bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases.\n            Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the\n            same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds\n            between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in the\n            table below, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds\n            appears in the table that follows. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the\n            bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, CF is 439\n            kJ/mol, CCl is 330 kJ/mol, and CBr is 275 kJ/mol.
We can use bond energies to calculate approximate enthalpy changes for reactions\n                    where enthalpies of formation are not available. Calculations of this type will\n                    also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic\n                    reaction (\xceH negative, heat produced) results when the\n                    bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants. An\n                    endothermic reaction (\xceH positive, heat absorbed)\n                    results when the bonds in the products are weaker than those in the\n                    reactants.
The enthalpy change, \xceH, for a chemical reaction is\n                    approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the\n                    reactants (energy cind, positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds\n                    are formed in the products (energy cout,d negative sign). This can be expressed\n                    mathematically in the following way:
In this expression, the symbol  means cthe sum ofd and D represents the bond\n                    energy in kilojoules per mole, which is always a positive number. The bond\n                    energy is obtained from a table, like the Bond Energies table above, and will depend on whether the\n                    particular bond is a single, double, or triple bond. Thus, in calculating\n                    enthalpies in this manner, it is important that we consider the bonding in all\n                    reactants and products. Because D values are typically averages for one type of\n                    bond in many different molecules, this calculation provides a rough estimate,\n                    not an exact value, for the enthalpy of reaction.
Using bond energies from the table above, calculate the enthalpy change of\n                        the following reaction:
or
To form two moles of HCl, one mole of HH bonds and one mole of ClCl bonds\n                        must be broken. The energy required to break these bonds is the sum of the\n                        bond energy of the HH bond (436 kJ/mol) and the ClCl bond (243 kJ/mol).\n                        During the reaction, two moles of HCl bonds are formed (bond energy = 432\n                        kJ/mol), releasing 2  432 kJ; or 864 kJ. Because the bonds in the products\n                        are stronger than those in the reactants, the reaction releases more energy\n                        than it consumes:
Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The\n                        high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon produces a mixture of the\n                        gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol\n                        can be produced. Using the bond energies in Table, calculate the approximate\n                        enthalpy change, \xceH, for the reaction here:
First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the\n                        products:
From this, we see that \xceH for this reaction involves\n                        the energy required to break a CO triple bond and two HH single bonds, as\n                        well as the energy produced by the formation of three CH single bonds, a\n                        CO single bond, and an OH single bond. We can express this as follows:
Using the bond energy values in the table above, we obtain:
In the following series of activities, we will calculate the change in\n                        enthalpy for the reaction below using bond energies.

Gases,Gas Laws,The Ideal Gas Law,"To this point, four separate laws have been\r\n\t\t\tdiscussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of the\r\n\t\t\tgas:
Combining these four laws yields the ideal gas\r\n\t\t\tlaw.
The ideal gas lawrelation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws shows the relation between the pressure, volume, temperature,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tand number of moles of a gas:
relation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthe gas, T is its temperature on the kelvin scale, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tR is a constant called the ideal gas constant or the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tuniversal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, and\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttemperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm\r\n\t\t\t\t\tmol  K  and 8.314 kPa L mol  K\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t .
Gases whose properties of P , V , and T are accurately\r\n\t\t\tdescribed by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit ideal\r\n\t\t\tbehavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypothetical\r\n\t\t\tconstruct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explain\r\n\t\t\tthe gas laws as will be described later in this unit. Although all the calculations\r\n\t\t\tpresented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for\r\n\t\t\tgases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final\r\n\t\t\tmodule of this unit, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the\r\n\t\t\tnon-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low\r\n\t\t\ttemperatures.
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, the\r\n\t\t\tideal gas constantconstant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K, R , and the variable properties P , V , n , and\r\n\t\t\t\tT . Specifying any four of these terms will permit use of\r\n\t\t\tthe ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following examples.
constant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K
If the number of moles of an ideal gas are kept constant under two different sets\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof conditions, a useful mathematical relationship called the combined gas law is\r\n\t\t\t\t\tobtained:
using units of atm, L, and K. Both sets of conditions are equal to the product\r\n\t\t\t\t\tof n  R (where n = the number of moles of the gas and R is the ideal\r\n\t\t\t\t\tgas law constant).
When filled with air, a typical scuba tank with\r\n\t\t\t\ta volume of 13.2 L has a pressure of 153 atm.

Letting 1 represent the air in the scuba tank\r\n\t\t\t\tand 2 represent the air in the lungs, and noting that body temperature (the\r\n\t\t\t\ttemperature the air will be in the lungs) is 37 C, we can identify the\r\n\t\t\t\tvariables as:

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ionic Compounds,"The nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is\n            the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred between atoms and ions\n            form, ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is,\n            the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this\n            case, cations and anions).
electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound
When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an\n            element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of\n            electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is\n            stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite\n            charge present in the compound.
For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one\n            electron to form a sodium cation, Na+, and each chlorine atom in a sample of\n            chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, Cl,\n            the resulting compound, NaCl, is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio\n            of one Na+ ion for each Cl ion. Similarly, each calcium atom\n            (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to\n            form CaCl2, which is composed of Ca2+ and Cl ions in\n            the ratio of one Ca2+ ion to two Cl ions.

A compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic\n            compoundCompound held together by ionic bonds.. The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic:\n            When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This\n            guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds\n            typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always\n            true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic).
Compound held together by ionic bonds.
You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are\n            solids that typically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures.\n            For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and boils at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the\n            molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C and AlCl3 melts at 180 °C.) In solid form, an ionic\n            compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow\n            (celectricityd is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct\n            electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Determination of Molecular Formulas,"Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a\n            compounds elements. Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single\n            molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its\n            molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by\n            various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the\n            mass spectrum of the compound. Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental\n            methods, many of which will be introduced in later in this course.
Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compounds molecular or molar mass to its\n            empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of\n            the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula.
The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the\n                    empirical formula by n, as shown by the generic empirical formula\n                        AxBy:
For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be\n                CH2O. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30\n            amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one O\n            atom). If the compounds molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this indicates that\n            molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the\n            empirical formula:
Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts\n            are six times greater than those in the empirical formula:
Note that this same approach may be used when the molar mass (g/mol) instead of the\n            molecular mass (amu) is used. In this case, we are merely considering one mole of\n            empirical formula units and molecules, as opposed to single units and molecules.
Nicotine, an alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants that is mainly responsible\n                for the addictive nature of cigarettes, contains 74.02% C, 8.710% H, and 17.27% N.\n                If 40.57 g of nicotine contains 0.2500 mol nicotine, what is the molecular\n                formula?
Determining the molecular formula from the provided data will require comparison of\n                the compounds empirical formula mass to its molar mass. As the first step, use the\n                percent composition to derive the compounds empirical formula. Assuming a\n                convenient, a 100-g sample of nicotine yields the following molar amounts of its\n                elements:
Next, we calculate the molar ratios of these elements relative to the least abundant\n                element, N.
The C-to-N and H-to-N molar ratios are adequately close to whole numbers, and so the\n                empirical formula is C5H7N. The empirical formula mass for\n                this compound is therefore 81.13 amu/formula unit, or 81.13 g/mol formula unit.
We calculate the molar mass for nicotine from the given mass and molar amount of\n                compound:
Comparing the molar mass and empirical formula mass indicates that each nicotine\n                molecule contains two formula units:
Thus, we can derive the molecular formula for nicotine from the empirical formula by\n                multiplying each subscript by two:

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Diagrams,"Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing\n\t\t\tthe individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single\n\t\t\thydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. We would\n\t\t\texpect to find the electron in the 1s orbital. By convention, the ms = +1/2\n\t\t\tvalue is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram\n\t\t\tare:
Following hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2. The helium\n\t\t\tatom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four\n\t\t\tquantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (n = 1, l = 0, ml = 0,\n\t\t\t\tms = +1/2). The second electron also goes into the 1s orbital and fills\n\t\t\tthat orbital. The second electron has the same n, l, and ml quantum numbers,\n\t\t\tbut must have the opposite spin quantum number, ms = /2. This is in accord\n\t\t\twith the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same\n\t\t\tset of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box\n\t\t\t(representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite\n\t\t\tdirections (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram\n\t\t\tof helium are:
The n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom.
The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first two\n\t\t\telectrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers\n\t\t\tas the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next\n\t\t\tlowest energy, the 2s orbital. Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of\n\t\t\tlithium are:
An atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4, contains four\n\t\t\tprotons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus. The fourth electron\n\t\t\tfills the remaining space in the 2s orbital.
An atom of boron (atomic number 5) contains five electrons. The n = 1 shell is filled\n\t\t\twith two electrons and three electrons will occupy the n = 2 shell. Because any s\n\t\t\tsubshell can contain only two electrons, the fifth electron must occupy the next energy\n\t\t\tlevel, which will be a 2p orbital. There are three 2p orbitals of equal energy (ml= ,\n\t\t, +1) and the electron can occupy any one of these p orbitals. When drawing orbital\n\t\t\tdiagrams, we include empty boxes to depict any empty orbitals in the same subshell that\n\t\t\twe are filling.
Carbon (atomic number 6) has six electrons. Four of them fill the 1s and 2s orbitals. The\n\t\t\tremaining two electrons occupy the 2p subshell. We now have a choice of filling one of\n\t\t\tthe 2p orbitals and pairing the electrons or of leaving the electrons unpaired in two\n\t\t\tdifferent p orbitals. The orbitals are filled as described by Hunds rulethe lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.: the\n\t\t\tlowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of orbitals of equal\n\t\t\tenergy is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the two electrons\n\t\t\tin the carbon 2p orbitals have identical n, l, and ms quantum numbers and\n\t\t\tdiffer in their ml quantum number (in accord with the Pauli exclusion\n\t\t\tprinciple). The electron configuration and orbital diagram for carbon are:
the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.
Nitrogen (atomic number 7) fills the 1s and 2s subshells and has one electron in each of\n\t\t\tthe three 2p orbitals, in accordance with Hunds rule. These three electrons have\n\t\t\tunpaired spins. Oxygen (atomic number 8) has a pair of electrons in any one of the 2p\n\t\t\torbitals (the electrons have opposite spins) and a single electron in each of the other\n\t\t\ttwo. Fluorine (atomic number 9) has only one 2p orbital containing an unpaired electron.\n\t\t\tAll of the electrons in the noble gas neon (atomic number 10) are paired, and all of the\n\t\t\torbitals in the n = 1 and the n = 2 shells are filled. The electron configurations and\n\t\t\torbital diagrams of these four elements are:
Note that you can also use the abbreviated electron configurations when writing the\n\t\t\torbital diagrams.

Reactions and Stoichiometry,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemical Reactions and Equations,Oxidation-Reduction: Reactions,"Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has\n            been established. Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactionsreaction involving a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements are those in which one or more\n            elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number. While the vast majority of redox\n            reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, a few\n            interesting exceptions to this rule do exist. Definitions for the complementary\n            processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:
reaction involving a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements
Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified\n            as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium\n            chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in\n            NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in\n            Cl2 to  in NaCl).
In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its\n            oxidation number increases from 0 in H2 to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced\n            (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to  in HCl).
Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including single-displacement\n            (replacement) reactions. These are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is\n            displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of\n            this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals:
Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for\n            example:
This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved\n            silver salt. Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of\n            the copper wire, and the resulting Cu2+ ions dissolve in the solution to\n            yield a characteristic blue color.
Combustion reactions are redox reactions in which the reductant (also called a\n                    fuel) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react\n                    vigorously and produce significant amounts of heat, and often light, in the form\n                    of a flame. The combustion of methane gas (CH4) is an example.
Although there are other types of combustion reactions, the most common types are\n                    when a hydrocarbon or an oxygen containing hydrocarbon react with oxygen in the\n                    air. In both cases the products of the reaction are carbon dioxide and\n                    water.
One such combustion reaction that you are likely familiar with is the reaction of\n                    propane (C3H8) burning in air when using a gas grill.
As with the combustion of all hydrocarbons, when the propane burns in air it is\n                    reacting with the oxygen in the air as seen in this equation.

Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Solids in Liquids,"The dependence of solubility on temperature for a number of solids in water is shown by\n            the solubility curves in the graph below. Reviewing these data indicate a general trend\n            of increasing solubility with temperature, although there are exceptions, as illustrated\n            by the ionic compound cerium sulfate.
The temperature dependence of solubility can be exploited to prepare supersaturated\n            solutions of certain compounds. A solution may be saturated with the compound at an\n            elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a\n            lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains\n            solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower\n            temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the\n            excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal or by mechanically agitating the\n            solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one pictured in Figure, take advantage of this\n            behavior.

In addition to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere,\n                    divers are subjected to additional pressure due to the water above them,\n                    experiencing an increase of approximately 1 atm for each 10 m of depth.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Module Summary and Quiz,"Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called\n                    the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An\n                    aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a\n                    solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of\n                    solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very\n                    useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter\n                    of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding\n                    solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple\n                    relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after\n                    dilution.
In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used\n                    in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution\n                    components masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high\n                    concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using\n                    ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other\n                    fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used.

Solutions,Colligative Properties,Module Summary and Assessments,"Properties of a solution that depend only on the concentration of solute particles are\n                called colligative properties. They include changes in the vapor pressure, boiling\n                point, and freezing point of the solvent in the solution. The magnitudes of these\n                properties depend only on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, not\n                on the type of particles. The total concentration of solute particles in a solution also\n                determines its osmotic pressure. This is the pressure that must be applied to the\n                solution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure solvent through a semipermeable\n                membrane into the solution. Ionic compounds may not completely dissociate in solution\n                due to activity effects, in which case observed colligative effects may be less than\n                predicted.

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Derived Units,"Conversions from one unit to another are also often required for derived units.  \n            Here we will look at examples of making conversions of derived units.
What is the density of common antifreeze in units of g/mL? A 4.00qt sample of the antifreeze weighs 9.26 lb. \n                $$\\mathrm{Density}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{mass}}{\\mathrm{volume}}\\;$$ Since we need to divide the mass in grams by the volume in \n                milliliters, we will convert the mass from lb to g and the volume from qt to mL. The necessary conversion \n                factors are 1 lb = 453.59 g; 1 L = 1.0567 qt; 1 L = 1,000 mL. We can convert mass from pounds to grams in \n                one step:
We can use two steps to convert volume from quarts to milliliters.
Then using the density equation.
Alternatively, the calculation could be set up in a way that uses three unit conversion factors sequentially as follows:

Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table,"As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number\n            so that elements with the same chemical properties recur periodically. When their\n            electron configurations are added to the table as in the periodic table below, we also\n            see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of\n            these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play\n            the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest\n            energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core\n            electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties\n            of the elements.
It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the\n            chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was\n            available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it hasthe\n            arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons in the\n            same group. This arrangement is emphasized in the periodic table below.
Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the\n            alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth\n            metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine\n            each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements\n            of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is\n            the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.
The periodic table can be divided into three categories of elements classified by the\n            orbitals being filled: main group, transition elements, and inner transition elements.\n            These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or\n            highest energy level orbitals of an atom.
Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the\n            last electron added enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and\n            red in periodic table below. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as\n            well as many metals and the intermediate semimetallic elements. The valence electrons\n            for main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga,\n            atomic number 31) has the electron configuration\n                [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence\n            electrons (underlined). The completely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence,\n            electrons. Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table. Just as it has 3 valence\n            electrons all of the elements in group 13 have 3 valence electrons. The periodic table\n            below indicates the number of valence electrons for each group of the main group\n            elements.
Transition elements or transition metals are metallic elements in which the last electron\n            added enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas\n            configuration) in these elements include the ns and (n  1) d electrons.
Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies\n            an f orbital. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n \n            2)f, the (n  1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:
The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)
The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)
Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series,\n            are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no\n            f electrons.
The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron\n                    configuration of an element. However, we do find exceptions to the order of\n                    filling of orbitals that are indicated by the aufbau principle we have just\n                    discussed. For instance, the electron configurations of the transition metals\n                    chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others,\n                    are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells\n                    with very similar energy (such as with 4s and 3d), and small effects can lead to\n                    changes in the order of filling.
In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled\n                    subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability\n                    is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the\n                    extra stability of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in\n                    Cu). Other exceptions also occur. There is no simple method to predict the\n                    exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is\n                    greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.

Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Module Sumamry and Quiz,"Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for\n                    atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic\n                    ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are\n                    used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a\n                    Lewis structure. Most structuresespecially those containing second row\n                    elementsobey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by\n                    eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules\n                    (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.
In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating\n                    each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These\n                    hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate\n                    Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as\n                    possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis\n                    structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of\n                    electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance\n                    hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis\n                    structures (the resonance forms).
The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that\n                    is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of\n                    molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms.\n                    The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required\n                    to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Binary Ionic Compounds,"In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the\n            total number of negative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically\n            neutral overall, even though they contain positive and negative ions. We can use this\n            observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic\n            compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative\n            charges are equal.
A binary ionic compoundIonic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion. consists of a monatomic (formed from one atom) cation and a\n            monatomic anion. Note that the ending of the names of monatomic anions are changed to\n            -ide. For example, sulfide is an ion of sulfur and phosphide is an ion of\n            phosphorus.
Ionic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion.
Write the chemical formula for potassium sulfide.
Referring to the periodic table, we see that\n                        potassium will form a 1+ ion and sulfur will form a 2- ion, as illustrated\n                        in the diagrams below.
In order to obtain a\n                        neutral compound 2 potassium ions must combine with 1 sulfur ion.
A convenient method to write chemical formulas is by using the criss-cross\n                    method. In this method the value of the ionic charge for the cation becomes the\n                    subscript of the anion in the chemical formula and the value of the ionic charge\n                    of the anion becomes the subscript of the cation in the chemical formula.\n                    Looking at the previous example we can see how the criss-cross method works.
Like the previous method, the result is K2S. One thing to remember with the\n                    criss-cross method is that the ratio of ions in a chemical formula of an ionic\n                    compound must always be in the smallest whole number ratio.
Write the chemical formula for magnesium oxide.
Notice the result of the criss-cross method results in:
This 2:2 ratio of ions is reduced to 1:1, resulting in the formula:
Given the name of a binary ionic compound you can derive the formula and given\n                    the formula you can name the compound.
Name the compound Li3P.
In all of the examples we have looked at so far the cation in the formula can only\n                    form one ion. For example, when the calcium atom forms an ion, it is always\n                        Ca2+ or when potassium forms an ion it is always K+.\n                    However some of the transition metals can form different ions. For example lead\n                    can form ion Pb2+ and Pb4+. So when it combines with\n                    chlorine the result may be PbCl2 or PbCl4. When we write\n                    the name for each of these formulas we need to indicate whether the compound is\n                    formed from the Pb2+ and Pb4+ ion. We do this using roman\n                    numerals. Where the roman numeral indicates the charge of the ion in the\n                    formula.
Note that not all transition metals can form multiple cations. Here is a list of\n                    the most common.
Chromium(III)
Cr3+
Manganese(III)
Mn3+
Iron(III)
Fe3+
Cobalt(III)
Co3+
Copper(II)
Cu2+
Mercury(II)
Hg2+
Tin(IV)
Sn4+
Lead(IV)
Pb4+
It is also worth noting that the following metals always form the same ion.\n                    Silver always forms Ag+. Cadmium always forms Cd2+. Zinc always forms Zn2+.\n                    Gallium always forms Ga3+. Aluminum always forms Al3+.

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,IMFs and Properties of Liquids,"When you pour a glass of water, or fill a car with gasoline, you observe that\n                    water and gasoline flow freely. But when you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil\n                    to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The\n                    viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline,\n                    and other liquids that flow freely have a low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor\n                    oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown below, have\n                    higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a\n                    metal ball falls through a liquid (the ball falls more slowly through a more\n                    viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a\n                    narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly).
The IMFs between the molecules of a liquid, the size and shape of the molecules,\n                    and the temperature determine how easily a liquid flows. As the table below\n                    shows, the more structurally complex are the molecules in a liquid and the\n                    stronger the IMFs between them, the more difficult it is for them to move past\n                    each other and the greater is the viscosity of the liquid. As the temperature\n                    increases, the molecules move more rapidly and their kinetic energies are better\n                    able to overcome the forces that hold them together; thus, the viscosity of the\n                    liquid decreases.
The various IMFs between identical molecules of a substance are examples of\n                    cohesive forces. The molecules within a liquid are surrounded by other molecules\n                    and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within the\n                    liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by\n                    about one-half as many molecules. Because of the unbalanced molecular\n                    attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that\n                    minimizes the number of molecules on the surfacethat is, the shape with the\n                    minimum surface area. A small drop of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape,\n                    as shown below, because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area to volume is\n                    at a minimum.
Surface tension is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of\n                    a liquid, or the force required to increase the length of a liquid surface by a\n                    given amount. This property results from the cohesive forces between molecules\n                    at the surface of a liquid, and it causes the surface of a liquid to behave like\n                    a stretched rubber membrane. Surface tensions of several liquids are presented\n                    in the table below.
Among common liquids, water exhibits a distinctly high surface tension due to\n                    strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. As a result of this high surface\n                    tension, the surface of water represents a relatively ctough skind that can\n                    withstand considerable force without breaking. A steel needle carefully placed\n                    on water will float. Some insects, like the one shown in Figure, even though\n                    they are denser than water, move on its surface because they are supported by\n                    the surface tension.
The IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called\n                            adhesive forces.  When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus\n                            (surface) has a concave shape because the water wets the glass and\n                            creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces\n                            between mercury atoms are much greater than the adhesive forces between\n                            mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass, and it forms a\n                            convex meniscus when confined in a tube because the cohesive forces\n                            within the mercury tend to draw it into a drop.
If you place one end of a paper towel in spilled wine, as shown below\n                           , the liquid wicks up the paper towel. A similar process occurs in\n                            a cloth towel when you use it to dry off after a shower. These are\n                            examples of capillary actionwhen a liquid flows within a porous\n                            material due to the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of\n                            the material and to other liquid molecules. The adhesive forces between\n                            the liquid and the porous material, combined with the cohesive forces\n                            within the liquid, may be strong enough to move the liquid upward\n                            against gravity.
Towels soak up liquids like water because the fibers of a towel are made\n                            of molecules that are attracted to water molecules. Most cloth towels\n                            are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp.\n                            Both consist of long molecules of cellulose that contain many OH\n                            groups. Water molecules are attracted to these OH groups and form\n                            hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose\n                            molecules. The water molecules are also attracted to each other, so\n                            large amounts of water are drawn up the cellulose fibers.
Capillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is\n                            immersed in a liquid, as illustrated below. If the liquid molecules\n                            are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the\n                            inside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive\n                            forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the\n                            higher the liquid climbs.

Solutions,Solubility,Module Summary and Quiz,"A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that\n            is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component\n            and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components\n            typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form\n            endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and\n            solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable\n            change in energy.
Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may\n            be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,\n            acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their\n            constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is\n            facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar\n            water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are\n            strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are\n            weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when\n            dissolved in water.
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several\n            factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces\n            that may exist between the substances atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to\n            dissolve is quantified as a substances solubility, its maximum concentration in a\n            solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute\n            at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a\n            solutes concentration exceeds its solubilitya nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that\n            will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.\n            Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low\n            mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing\n            temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.\n            The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial\n            pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henrys\n            law.

Gases,Gas Laws,Module Summary and Quiz,"The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations\n            of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to\n            its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Gay-Lussac\'s law).\n            The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at\n            constant pressure (Charless law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely\n            proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyles law). Under the\n            same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same\n            number of molecules (Avogadros law).
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the\n            gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Module Summary and Quiz,"The physical properties of condensed matter (liquids and solids) can be explained in\n            terms of the kinetic molecular theory. In a liquid, intermolecular attractive forces\n            hold the molecules in contact, although they still have sufficient KE to move past each\n            other.
Intermolecular attractive forces, collectively referred to as van der Waals forces, are\n            responsible for the behavior of liquids and solids and are electrostatic in nature.\n            Dipole-dipole attractions result from the electrostatic attraction of the partial\n            negative end of one dipolar molecule for the partial positive end of another. The\n            temporary dipole that results from the motion of the electrons in an atom can induce a\n            dipole in an adjacent atom and give rise to the London dispersion force. London forces\n            increase with increasing molecular size. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of\n            dipole-dipole attraction that results when hydrogen is bonded to one of the three most\n            electronegative elements: F, O, or N.
The intermolecular forces between molecules in the liquid state vary depending upon their\n            chemical identities and result in corresponding variations in various physical\n            properties. Cohesive forces between like molecules are responsible for a liquids\n            viscosity (resistance to flow) and surface tension (elasticity of a liquid surface).\n            Adhesive forces between the molecules of a liquid and different molecules composing a\n            surface in contact with the liquid are responsible for phenomena such as surface wetting\n            and capillary rise.

Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Module Summary and Quiz,"The formula mass of a substance is the sum of the average atomic masses of each\n                    atom represented in the chemical formula and is expressed in atomic mass units.\n                    The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular mass. A\n                    convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules\n                    is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities\n                    composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 , a quantity called\n                    Avogadros number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass.\n                    Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit\n                    and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) for any substance\n                    are numerically equivalent (for example, one H2O molecule weighs\n                    approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H2O molecules weighs approximately\n                    18 g).
The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers\n                    of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent\n                    compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compounds percent\n                    composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it\n                    is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compounds empirical\n                    formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to\n                    the compounds molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula.

Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions,"The ions that we have discussed so far are called monatomic ions, that is, they are ions\n            formed from only one atom. We also find many polyatomic ionsions composed of more than one atom. These ions, which act as\n            discrete units, are electrically charged molecules (a group of bonded atoms with an\n            overall charge). Some of the more important polyatomic ions are listed in Table.\n            Oxyanions are polyatomic ions that contain one or more oxygen atoms. At this point in\n            your study of chemistry, you should memorize the names, formulas, and charges of the\n            most common polyatomic ions. Because you will use them repeatedly, they will soon become\n            familiar.
ions composed of more than one atom
Note that there is a system for naming some polyatomic ions; -ate and -ite are suffixes\n            designating polyatomic ions containing more or fewer oxygen atoms. Per- (short for\n            chyperd) and hypo- (meaning cunderd) are prefixes meaning more oxygen atoms than -ate\n            and fewer oxygen atoms than -ite, respectively. For example, perchlorate is\n                ClO4, chlorate is ClO3, chlorite is\n                ClO2 and hypochlorite is ClO. Unfortunately, the\n            number of oxygen atoms corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for\n            example, nitrate is NO3 while sulfate is SO42.
Many ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions as the cation, the anion, or both. As with\n            simple ionic compounds, these compounds must also be electrically neutral, so their\n            formulas can be predicted by treating the polyatomic ions as discrete units. We use\n            parentheses in a formula to indicate a group of atoms that behave as a unit. For\n            example, the formula for calcium phosphate, one of the minerals in our bones, is\n                Ca3(PO4)2. This formula indicates that there are\n            three calcium ions (Ca2+) for every two phosphate\n                (PO43) groups. The PO43 groups are\n            discrete units, each consisting of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms, and having\n            an overall charge of 3. The compound is electrically neutral, and its formula shows a\n            total count of three Ca, two P, and eight O atoms.
We can apply the same steps as we saw earlier with addition of parenthesis where\n            necessary.
Write the chemical formula for calcium nitrate.
The 2 becomes the subscript for the nitrate ion and the 1 becomes the subscript for\n                the calcium ion.
Ca(NO3)2
Notice we use parenthesis around the NO3. To represent more than one of\n                the same polyatomic ion in a formula, you must use parenthesis.
Write the chemical formula for ammonium carbonate.
(NH4)2CO3
We can also apply the general steps for naming ionic compounds to compounds with\n                    polyatomic ions.
It is helpful to note that there are not many positive polyatomic ions. You\'ll\n                    notice the only one on the list above is ammonium (NH4+). When\n                    identifying the cation and anion in an ionic compound in most cases, with the\n                    exception of compounds containing ammonium, the first element is the cation and\n                    the rest of the formula represents the anion.
We see in the example above the cation is potassium and the rest of the formula\n                        C2H3O2 is the anion acetate. Giving the\n                    name: potassium acetate
In this example the cation is barium and the rest of the formula\n                        Cr2O7 is the anion dichromate. Giving the name: Barium dichromate

Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A\n                    large number of important reactions are included in three categories:\n                    precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation\n                    reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base\n                    reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants. Redox\n                    reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant\n                    elements.

Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Temperature Conversions,"We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change \n            in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract \n            when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume \n            as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we \n            can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler.
To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the \n            freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, at a pressure of 1.0 atm, 0 °C \n            is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 °C as the boiling temperature of water. The space \n            between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit \n            scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 °F and the boiling temperature as 212 °F. The space between \n            these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).
Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a \n            slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units \n            of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to \n            one another (y = mx).
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:
To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit \n            scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature \n            that can theoretically be achieved. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas\'s volume and \n            temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at .15 °C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson, \n            who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment \n            of this topic is provided later in this course).  A degree Celsius is the same size as  a Kelvin.
To convert Celsius to Kelvin:
To convert Kelvin to Celsius:
Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in \n            many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world. Very \n            few countries (the U.S. and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, and Palau) still use Fahrenheit \n            for weather, medicine, and cooking.
You are visiting Paris, France and you see that the high temperature for the day is going to be 13.5 °C.  \n                What is this temperature in °F and K?
