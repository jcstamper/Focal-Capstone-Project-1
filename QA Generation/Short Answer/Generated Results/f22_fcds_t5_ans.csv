Advanced Natural Language Processing,BERT,Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT),,"As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though it would be more accurate to say that its non-directional. This characteristic allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word). The fundamental units which enable the ability to comprehend the entire context of input without treating it like a sequence are made possible by the mechanism of attention. Attention is a mechanism that can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. Transformer models use multi-head attention to efficiently capture the context and relative importance of input sequence and also enable parallelization of model training.",What is a mechanism that can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output?,Attention

Collecting and Understanding Data,Data Collection,Validity and Bias,,"Information Bias. Also known as measurement bias, it occurs when data is collected, measured, or interpreted wrongly. Misclassification of observations is an example of information bias. For example, an observation with attributes similar to the stereotypical female student is recorded as female when that observation is actually from a male student. Another example is the misclassification of patients. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,  groups under the age of 45 are seen as low risk. o during a screening exercise, those in that age group might not be screened and therefore classified as negative. The data collected then has a misclassification bias and is not accurate. One way to control information bias is to implement blinding.",What is information bias also known as?,Measurement bias

The Tf method discussed earlier assigns an importance value to all the words purely based on their frequency. Hence, features corresponding to words that appear more frequently, like stopwords, get assigned a large value in comparison to words that could potentially warrant higher importance in the corpus. Therefore, tf-idf is a way to cnormalized these high-frequency values. In tf-idf, for any word not in the corpus, we can either ignore it or consider its frequency under another/foreign word column.",How can we cnormalize these high-frequency values?,tf-idf

Analytic Algorithms and Model Building,Supervised and Unsupersived Techniques,Tree-based Methods,"Building Classification Trees,Building Regression Trees","Random Forests. This is an extension of bagging and makes some changes to bagged trees. When there is overfitting with decision trees, random forests will remedy this issue. Similar to bagging, a random forest will perform well because it consists of a large number of decorrelated trees (the focus is on the low correlation between trees). A Random Forest will build several decision trees and then merge them for better accuracy and predictive value. It is used for classification and regression tasks and it searches for the best feature within a random subset of features in a dataset. Random forest method will also evaluate the importance of features and scale the results of this assessment to show the importance of features. This is useful for feature engineering as you can eliminate the features that do not contribute to your task without losing information. Random forests create random subsets of features and combine those subsets which prevent overfitting. The number of features to be included can be derived by calculating the square root of the number of predictors. The downside to the random forest method is that it can be computationally slow in making predictions (but not slow to train).",What is an extension of bagging and makes some changes to bagged trees?,Random Forests

The LeNet CNN architecture is made up of several layers that implement feature extraction and then classification (see the following image). The image is divided into receptive fields that feed into a convolutional layer, which then extracts features from the input image. The next step is pooling, which reduces the dimensionality of the extracted features (through down-sampling) while retaining the most important information (typically, through max pooling). Another convolution and pooling step is then performed that feeds into a fully connected multilayer perceptron. The final output layer of this network is a set of nodes that identify features of the image (in this case, a node per identified number). You can train the network by using back-propagation.",How do early layers in a CNN recognize features?,As a deep network

The primary difference between a typical multi-layer network and a recurrent network is that, rather than completely feed-forward connections, a recurrent network might have connections that feed back into prior layers (or into the same layer). This feedback allows RNNs to maintain memory of past inputs and model relationships in time. The key differentiator is feedback within the network, which could manifest itself from a hidden layer, the output layer, or some combination thereof.

Analytic Algorithms and Model Building,Supervised and Unsupersived Techniques,Bayes Method,Naive Bayes (NB) Method,"Named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, naive Bayes is a simple classifier that can be applied to categorical predictors. When classifying observations using NB, the classifier computes the probability for all possible classes given all the observed evidence and then classifies the observation as belonging to the class with the maximum posterior probability. When the problem calls for predicting the probability that an observation belongs to a class, we can use this method. Naive Bayes is based on applying the Bayes theorem and assumes that all predictors or observed features are independent. Although this is a naive assumption, naive Bayes performs quite well for real-world applications. A fruit that is green, round and 18cm in diameter can be considered to be a honeydew melon.  The NB classifier will assume that all these features independently contribute to the probability that the fruit with these features is honeydew melon. Naive Bayes can perform well with a small training dataset for estimating the right parameters for a classification task. A downside to this model outside of its naivety is that studies have been conducted, showing it does not perform as well as methods like random forests. NB is said to be a good classifier, but as an estimator, its probability outputs should are not as strong. When model complexity is not important, NB can be used for high-dimensional data. This is because when the dimension of a dataset is large, data points are more likely to be further apart than in cases with low-dimensional data.",What is naive Bayes based on?,Bayes theorem

Exploratory Data Analysis,Feature Engineering,Principal Component Analysis,"Dimensionality,Feature Extraction","As you develop analytic models or perform exploratory data analysis, you will encounter datasets with a large number of variables. A small dataset can also become quite large post data cleaning -think about when you transform variables by creating new variables, e.g., dummy variables. Considerations for a dataset with a large number of variables include issues with over-fitting and computing costs. We think about the dimensionality of a model when we consider the number of variables used by the model. The mathematician R. Bellman defined the curse of dimensionality as the problem caused by the exponential increase in volume associated with adding extra dimensions or variables to a space. This just means that when there are more features in a dataset, you are prone to more errors. A dataset with a large number of features could have lots of redundancy and noisy data with little benefit to your overall analytic objective. How can you address the curse of dimensionality without losing useful information? We use the technique of dimensionality reduction, sometimes referred to as feature extraction or factor selection.

Taken from the concept of automotive crumple zones, which are designed to be destroyed in an accident, absorbing the force of the impact and protecting the passengers, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. Elish uses the idea of the moral crumple zone pejoratively, saying that someone is picked in advance to be blamed in the event that something goes badly wrong.
