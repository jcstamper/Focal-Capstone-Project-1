0,4018,4018,199,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Exceptions to the Octet Rule,"While most central atoms of molecules and polyatomic ions have eight electrons, some have            central atoms that do not have an octet of electrons in their Lewis structures. These            molecules fall into three categories:
First we will consider hypervalent molecules. These are the most common of the exceptions            and will be important to understand for our discussion in the next module.
Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n =                    2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because                    they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three                        2p orbitals).
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 2nd period, C, N, O, and F do NOT exceed                    an octet.
Elements in the third and higher periods (n  3) have                    their valence electrons in the 3rd period or higher. These shells include a d                    subshell and allow atoms in the 3rd period or higher to accommodate more than an                    octet of electrons.
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 3rd period or higher, while they usually                    form an octet, can exceed an octet of electrons. Molecules formed from these                    elements are called hypervalent molecules. The Lewis structures below show two                    hypervalent molecules, SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, which is used as an                    insulating gas in the electrical industry, but is a potent greenhouse gas.
In some hypervalent molecules, such as XeF4, xenon tetrafluoride which                     was the first binary compound of a noble gas, some of the electrons in                    the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs:
When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have                    electrons left over after filling the valence shells of the outer atoms with                    eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central                    atom.
Determine the Lewis structure for phosphorus pentachloride,                        PCl5, which is an important chlorinating agent in organic and inorganic synthesis. .
As before, we need to calculate the number of valence electrons that will be                        represented in the Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central P atom to the terminal Cl atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The Lewis structure now shows all 40 valence electrons in the molecule and is                        therefore complete.
Determine the Lewis structure for iodine pentafluoride, IF5, a fluorinating agent.
Calculate the number of valence electrons that will be represented in the                        Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central I atom to the terminal F atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The structure with the octets of the terminal atoms complete shows 40                        electrons. There are still 2 electrons to incorporate into the structure.                        These additional electrons are added to the central atom.
Now the structure shows all 42 electrons. Note that no additional electrons                        can be added to the F atoms because F is in the 2nd period and cannot exceed                        an octet of electrons.
We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not                    have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms                    from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not                    form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium                    dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium                    and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is                    possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a                    fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental                    evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for BF single                    bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three BF single bonds and an                    electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with                    an electron deficient boron. However, the BF bonds are slightly shorter than                    what is actually expected for BF single bonds, indicating that some double bond                    character is found in the actual molecule.
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight                    electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with                        BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the                    boron atom:
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals.                            Nitric oxide, NO a biological signaling molecule, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is                            produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react                            at high temperatures. Odd electron molecules are very rare and cannot                            achieve full octets of electrons around atoms because of the odd number                            of electrons. The two possible Lewis structures for NO are seen                            below. Based on formal charge, the left structure is more plausible than the right structure.

1,2881,2881,137,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Significant Figures in Calculations,"A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement            are at least as uncertain as the measurement itself. We must take the uncertainty in our            measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated            results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct            number of significant figures, which is determined by the following four rules for            rounding numbers:
When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same                            number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal                            places (i.e., the least certain value in terms of addition and                            subtraction).
Add 1.0023 g and 4.383 g.
The answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is 5.385 g (round to                the thousandths place; three decimal places)
Subtract 421.23 g from 486 g.
The answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is is 65 g (round to                the ones place; no decimal places)
When we multiply or divide numbers, we should round the result to the                            same number of digits as the number with the least number of significant                            figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and                            division).
Multiply 0.6238 cm and 6.60 cm.
When these values are multiplied, we get 4.11708 cm2. The least certain                measurement has 3 significant figures. The final answer should be rounded to three                significant figures. The final answer rounded to the correct number of significant                figures is 4.12 cm2.
Divide 421.23 g by 48 mL.
When these values are divided we get 8.775625 g/mL. The least certain measurement has                2 significant figures. The final answer should be rounded to two significant                figures. The final answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is                8.8 g/mL.
In the midst of all these technicalities, it is important to keep in mind the reason why            we use significant figures and rounding rulesto correctly represent the uncertainty of            the values we report and to ensure that a calculated result is not represented as being            more certain than the least certain value used in the calculation.

2,4098,4098,203,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Liquids in Liquids,"We know that some liquids mix with each other in all proportions; in other words, they            have infinite mutual solubility and are said to be miscible. Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and            ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze) are examples of liquids that are            completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline.
Liquids that mix with water in all proportions are usually polar substances or substances            that form hydrogen bonds. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen            bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as            those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds            of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because            there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent,            and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in            polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration            of the chemical axiom clike dissolves like.d
Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible.                    Layers are formed when we pour immiscible liquids into the same container.                    Gasoline, oil, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other                    nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. The attraction between the molecules                    of such nonpolar liquids and polar water molecules is ineffectively weak. The                    only strong attractions in such a mixture are between the water molecules, so                    they effectively squeeze out the molecules of the nonpolar liquid. The                    distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of degrees, so                    that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to                    be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility.
Two liquids, such as bromine and water, that are of moderate mutual solubility are said            to be partially miscible. Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when            mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated            with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is            nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly            discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water            in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine            layer.

3,2777,2777,132,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Partial Pressure of Gases,"Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases            do not affect each others pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same            pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container. The pressure            exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressurepressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture. This            observation is summarized by Daltons law of partial pressures.
pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture
The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial                pressures of the component gases:
P_{Total} = P_A + P_B + P_C + ... = \\Sigma_iP_i 
In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases,                    PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial                pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its            mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component            of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:
P_A = X_A \imes P_{Total} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{where}\\ X_A =                \\frac{n_A}{n_{Total}}
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole            fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the            number of moles of all components in the mixture.
A 10.0L vessel contains 2.50 -3 mol of H2, 1.00 -3 mol                of He, and 3.00 -4 mol of Ne at 35 C.
(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?
(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?
The gases behave independently, so the partial pressure of each gas can be determined                from the ideal gas equation, using:
P = \\frac{nRT}V.
\equire{cancel} P_{H_2} = \\frac{(2.50 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 6.32 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\mathrm{atm}
\equire{cancel} P_{H_e} = \\frac{(1.00 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 2.53 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\mathrm{atm}
\equire{cancel} P_{N_e} = \\frac{(3.00 \imes 10^{-4}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 7.58 \imes 10^{-4}                    \\mathrm{atm}
The total pressure is given by the sum of the partial pressures:
P_T = P_{H_2} + P_{H_e} + P_{N_e} = (0.00632 + 0.00253 + 0.00076)                    \\mathrm{atm} = 9.61 \imes 10^{-3} \\mathrm{atm}
Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.
A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41                mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.
(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?
(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?
The mole fraction is given by XA = nA/nTotal and the                partial pressure is PA = XA  PTotal.
For O2,
X_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{2.83 \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41)                    \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.252
and
P_{O_2} = X_{O_2} \imes P_{Total} = 0.252 \imes 192 \\mathrm{kPa} = 48.4                    \\mathrm{kPa}
For N2O,
X_{N_2O} = \\frac{n_{N_2O}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{8.41                    \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41) \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.748
and
P_{N_2O} = X_{N_2O} \imes P_{Total} = 0.748 \imes 192 \\mathrm{kPa} =                    143.6 \\mathrm{kPa}

The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with                    an electron deficient boron. However, the BF bonds are slightly shorter than                    what is actually expected for BF single bonds, indicating that some double bond                    character is found in the actual molecule.
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight                    electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with                        BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the                    boron atom:
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals.                            Nitric oxide, NO a biological signaling molecule, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is                            produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react                            at high temperatures. Odd electron molecules are very rare and cannot                            achieve full octets of electrons around atoms because of the odd number                            of electrons. The two possible Lewis structures for NO are seen                            below. Based on formal charge, the left structure is more plausible than the right structure.

5,4721,4721,248,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table,"As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number            so that elements with the same chemical properties recur periodically. When their            electron configurations are added to the table as in the periodic table below, we also            see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of            these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play            the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest            energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core            electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties            of the elements.
It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the            chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was            available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it hasthe            arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons in the            same group. This arrangement is emphasized in the periodic table below.
Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the            alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth            metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine            each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements            of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is            the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.
The periodic table can be divided into three categories of elements classified by the            orbitals being filled: main group, transition elements, and inner transition elements.            These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or            highest energy level orbitals of an atom.
Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the            last electron added enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and            red in periodic table below. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as            well as many metals and the intermediate semimetallic elements. The valence electrons            for main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga,            atomic number 31) has the electron configuration                [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence            electrons (underlined). The completely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence,            electrons. Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table. Just as it has 3 valence            electrons all of the elements in group 13 have 3 valence electrons. The periodic table            below indicates the number of valence electrons for each group of the main group            elements.
Transition elements or transition metals are metallic elements in which the last electron            added enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas            configuration) in these elements include the ns and (n  1) d electrons.
Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies            an f orbital. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n             2)f, the (n  1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:
The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)
The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)
Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series,            are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no            f electrons.
The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron                    configuration of an element. However, we do find exceptions to the order of                    filling of orbitals that are indicated by the aufbau principle we have just                    discussed. For instance, the electron configurations of the transition metals                    chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others,                    are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells                    with very similar energy (such as with 4s and 3d), and small effects can lead to                    changes in the order of filling.
In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled                    subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability                    is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the                    extra stability of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in                    Cu). Other exceptions also occur. There is no simple method to predict the                    exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is                    greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.

6,3840,3840,194,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Single-step Conversions,"Sometimes it is necessary to convert a measurement from one unit to another. For            instance, if a measurement is given in miles it may be convenient or necessary to            convert it to km or m. Dimensional analysisMethod used to convert from one unit of measure to another. (or factor-label method) is a method used to            convert from one unit of measure to another. Dimensional analysis is based on this            premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations            as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from            simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several            different quantities.
Method used to convert from one unit of measure to another.
A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be            used as a unit conversion factorratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are            equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the            ratio,
ratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit
Several other commonly used equalities are given in table below.
*Note in the table above, that the English units ounces (oz) and fluid ounces (fl oz) are            often both referred to as ounces in everyday use. However, they are distinctly different            as oz is a unit of mass and fl oz is a unit of volume.
When we multiply a quantity (such as distance given in inches) by an appropriate unit            conversion factor, we convert the quantity to an equivalent value with different units            (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball players vertical jump of            34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:
When we multiply by the unit factor                \\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.} we do not change            the value of the measurement because 2.54 cm is equivalent to 1 in.
The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit                conversion factor derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g.
We can form two conversion factors from the relationship between ounces and                grams.
To determine which conversion factor to use to make the conversion, we need to look                carefully at the units. Since we are converting from g to oz, we want the unit of g                to cancel out. The unit factor that causes the unit of g to cancel is:
Notice that the unit of g cancels, leaving the unit of ounces. Also, notice that the                final answer has 3 significant figures because the original measurement has 3                significant figures. In this context, the 1 in 1 oz is an exact number and has an                infinite number of significant figures.

7,2121,2121,105,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure,"The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and            the molecular structures:
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for CO2.
We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:
This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atomeach double                bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using                VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves                on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180. The electron-pair                geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are                linear.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for BCl3.
We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:
Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of                electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives                a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The BCl bonds lie in a plane with 120                angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular structure.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a water molecule.
The Lewis structure of H2O indicates that there are four regions of high                electron density around the oxygen atom: two lone pairs and two chemical bonds:
We predict that these four regions are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion. Thus, the                electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular structure is bent with an                angle slightly less than 109.5. In fact, the bond angle is 104.5.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of SF4.
The Lewis structure of SF4 indicates five regions of electron density                around the sulfur atom: one lone pair and four bonding pairs:
We predict that these five regions of electron density are arranged to give a                trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry. The one lone-pair on the sulfur will                occupy a position in the equitorial plane, giving a seesaw molecular geometry.
When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular                    structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do                    not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms                    that each possess a clocald geometry. The way these local structures are                    oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but                    such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory                    discussion. For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local                    structures.
The Lewis structure for the simplest amino acid, glycine,                            H2NCH2CO2H, is shown here. Predict the                        local geometry for the nitrogen atom, the two carbon atoms, and the oxygen                        atom with a hydrogen atom attached:
Consider each central atom independently.

We can use the wedge and dash notation when drawing the Lewis structure to                        better represent the local shapes within the molecule.

8,4328,4328,215,Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Colloids,"Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly            basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from            wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain            carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or            sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic            acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic            acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and            contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35            unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the  CO2 unit (shown below).
Soaps contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon                end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end is a carboxylate group. The                length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from soap to soap.
Detergents (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar            hydrocarbon chains, such as C12H25, and an ionic group, such as a            sulfate, or a sulfonate (such            as the detergent shown below). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium compounds in            hard water; detergents form water-soluble productsa definite advantage for            detergents.
Detergents contain a nonpolar                hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a                sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from                detergent to detergent.
The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be            explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon            (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,            nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted            by water (polar), illustrated in the following figure. As a result, the soap or            detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the            water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar            and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a            hydrophobic (cwater-fearingd) part and a hydrophilic (cwater-lovingd) part. As a            consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily            washed away.
This diagrammatic cross section of an                emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent acts as an                emulsifier.
Dispersed colloidal particles are often            electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not            contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the            iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and            the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide            ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have            positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged            dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign.            This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each            other.
The charged nature of some colloidal particles may            be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For example, the particles            comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick            Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The            charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized            and deposited as dust, such as in the Cottrell precipitator shown below. This is one of            the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes.            The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and            flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air            filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.
In a Cottrell precipitator, positively                and negatively charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes,                where they are neutralized and deposited as dust.
Gelatin desserts, such as Jell-O, are a type of            colloid. Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates            as it cools, yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal            dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a solid phase. It appears that the fibers of the            dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled            with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium.
Gelatin desserts are colloids in which                an aqueous solution of sweeteners and flavors is dispersed throughout a medium                of solid proteins. (credit photo: modification of work by Steven                Depolo)

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the            atoms.
A representation of a molecule that gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule.
Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular            formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine                (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent            distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the            element titanium.
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the            molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
If we know a compounds formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives            vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

10,2416,2416,118,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Physical Processes,"One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical            process is known as calorimetryprocess of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat            transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated            object (calorimeterdevice used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter            is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to            establish the calorimeters heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach            requires the definition of a systemportion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical            or physical change) and its surroundingsall matter other than the system being studied (the other components of the measurement            apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the            system). Knowledge of the heat capacity of the surroundings, and careful measurements of            the masses of the system and surroundings and their temperatures before and after the            process allows one to calculate the heat transferred as described in this section.

A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or            physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a            calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which            increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is            absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature. The            temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be            used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.
Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat            between the calorimeter and its environment. This enables the accurate determination of            the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General            chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups.            These easy-to-use ccoffee cupd calorimeters allow more heat exchange with their            surroundings, and therefore produce less accurate energy values, but for the purposes of            a general chemistry student are accurate enough.
Before we practice calorimetry problems involving chemical reactions, consider a simpler            example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry.
Click through the slide show below that describes the general concepts of calorimetry.
If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two            substances (in this example the water and the metal), with no heat gained or lost by            either the calorimeter or the calorimeters surroundings. Under these ideal            circumstances, the net heat change is zero:
This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by the metal is equal to            the heat lost the water:
The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the            negative sign merely shows that qmetal and qwater are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain            or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic sign of either q            value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per            definition). In the specific situation described, qmetal is a negative value and qwater is positive, since heat is transferred from the metal to the            water.
A 248 g piece of copper is dropped into 392 mL of water at 22.6 C in a coffee cup                calorimeter. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 C. Calculate                the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs                between the copper and the water. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g C.
The temperature of the water increases from 22.6 C to 39.9 C, so the water absorbs                heat. That heat came from the piece of copper, which initially was at a higher                temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the copper and the water,                with no heat clostd to the surroundings, then heat given off by the copper = heat                taken in by water, or:
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:
Letting f = final and i = initial, in                expanded form, this becomes:
The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 392 mL of water = 392 g. Noting that the final                temperature of both the copper and water is 39.9 C, substituting known values                yields:
Rearranging to solve for Ti,copper:
Solving this gives Ti,copper = 337 C, so the initial temperature of the                copper was 337 C.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of            an unknown metal.
A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly                transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 C in a calorimeter. The final                temperature is 28.5 C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal.                Use this result to identify the metal.
Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,                or:
                qmetal = qwater
In expanded form, this is:
Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was            100.0 C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:
Rearranging the equation to solve for cmetal:
Comparing this with values in the table on page ""Heat Capacity and Specific Heat"" , our            experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g C), so we identify the metal as copper.","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to see the example progress.",measuring,what is the process used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process?,1,1,4.470588235294109,28.61213111877441
11,1495,1495,76,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Mole Fraction and Molality,"Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were            introduced earlier, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications.            For example, molarity (M) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations,            since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species:
Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary.            When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of            solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the            contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many            colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent            on temperature. Two such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous unit on            gases) and molality.
The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the                    total number of moles of all solution components:
Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of                    solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms:
Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with            temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring            temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as            will be described in this module.
The antifreeze in most automobile radiators is a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene                glycol and water, with minor amounts of other additives that prevent corrosion. What                are the (a) mole fraction and (b) molality of ethylene glycol,                    C2H4(OH)2, in a solution prepared from 2.22                     103 g of ethylene glycol and 2.00  103 g of water                (approximately 2 L of glycol and 2 L of water)?
(a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar                amounts of both solution components and then substituting these amounts into the                unit definition.
Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties                with identical units (moles).
(b) To find molality, we need to know the moles of the solute and the mass of the                solvent (in kg).
First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of                solute:
Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms:
Finally, calculate molarity per its definition:
Calculate the mole fraction of solute and solvent in a 2.80 m solution of sodium                chloride.
Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing                the two unit definitions. In this case, both units have the same numerator (moles of                solute) but different denominators. The provided molal concentration may be written                as:
The numerator for this solutions mole fraction is, therefore, 2.80 mol NaCl. The                denominator may be computed by deriving the molar amount of water corresponding to                1.00 kg
and then substituting these molar amounts into the definition for mole fraction.
Note that the sum of the mole fraction of NaCl and the mole fraction of H2O is 1 (0.952 + 0.0480 = 1.000). This is true in general - the sum of the mole fractions of the solution components always equals 1.

12,3129,3129,151,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,The Bohr Model of the Atom,"Following the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth            century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and            even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This            picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature csolar            systemd with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. This            classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron            moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and,            according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic            radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electrons orbit getting            continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are            inherently unstable.
In 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical            electromagnetisms prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously            emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the            atom Plancks ideas of quantization and Einsteins finding that light consists of            photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron            orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state            hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The            energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies.
Bohr assumed that only discrete values for these could occur. Bohr was able to calculate            the energies of each orbital and he found that they fit the following equation:
In this expression, k is a constant comprising fundamental constants of Ryberg\'s contant,            Plancks constant and the speed of light ( k = (hcRH) =            2.18-18 J ). The energies of the orbitals calculated are seen in the            image below. Notice that as the more negative the calculated value, the lower the energy            with n = 1 having the most negative value, which means it has the lowest energy.
One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest            possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit,            the orbit in which it has the lowest energy.             When the electron is in this lowest energy            orbit, the atom is said to be in its ground electronic statestate in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible (or simply ground state). If the            atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to            an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic statestate having an energy greater than the ground-state energy (or            simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an            excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the            difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an            atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more            excited one.
state in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible
state having an energy greater than the ground-state energy
We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about            energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy            energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron            from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the            electron returns to its initial state. In effect, an atom can cstored energy by using it            to promote an electron to a state with a higher energy and release it when the electron            returns to a lower state. The energy can be released as one quantum of energy, as the            electron returns to its ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 1), or it can be released            as two or more smaller quanta as the electron falls to an intermediate state, then to            the ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 4, emitting one quantum, then to n = 1,            emitting a second quantum).

13,4390,4390,224,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron                    configurations. The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may                    be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of                    these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron                    shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily                    determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to                    fill their valence shells.
Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by                    the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared                    equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one                    atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The                    ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called                    its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms                    determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical                    atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or                    pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the                    case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.

The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids,                covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of                crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the                arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them.                Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have                distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of                interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures.

15,1429,1429,73,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Lone Pairs of Electrons and Bond Angles,"Small distortions from the ideal angles can result from differences in repulsion between            various regions of electron density. In the following activity you will observe the            differences in bond angles between molecules that have the same electron-pair geometry,            but different numbers of lone pairs of electrons and therefore different molecular            shapes.
If you would like to open the simulation in a separate tab, click this                    link:Molecular                    Shapes
Open the simulation and choose ""Real Molecules."" In the ""Name"" section check                ""Molecule Geometry"" and ""Electron Geometry."" In the ""Options"" section check ""Show                Bond Angles."" Choose each of the molecules in the table below and fill in the                appropriate information. Note you may have to move the molecules around a bit to see                the bond angles clearly. Observe the molecules with and without viewing the lone                pairs of electrons by checking and unchecking ""Show Lone Pairs"" in the ""Options""                section.            
As seen in the activity above in the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached            to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal planar molecular structure,            but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramidal with the nitrogen atom at the apex            and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal            pyramidal shape are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are            slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than            do bonding electrons. The HNH bond angles in NH3 are slightly smaller than the 109.5            angle in a regular tetrahedral shape such as that of CH4 because the lone pair-bonding            pair repulsion is greater than the bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion.
Small distortions from the ideal angles result from differences in repulsion between            various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by            establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by            different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest            to least repulsion is:
lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair
This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of            electrons. A lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons            in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy more space than those in a            double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is:
lone pair > triple bond > double bond > single bond
Consider formaldehyde, H2CO, which is used as a preservative for biological            and anatomical specimens (Figure). This molecule has regions of high electron density            that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal            planar with 120 bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger            angles (121), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118).
The table below summarizes the content you explored previously. It is included here for            reference and convenience.
According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in the table above) are            equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries            (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone            pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal            electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in            diagram below: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two            axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial            position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). The axial            position is surrounded by bond angles of 90, whereas the equatorial position has more            space available because of the 120 bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair            geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious            positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs. Theoretically, we can come            up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF3            molecule. The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial            locations, giving a T-shaped molecular structure.
When a central atom has two lone electron pairs and four bonding regions, we have an            octahedral electron-pair geometry. The two lone pairs are on opposite sides of the            octahedron (180 apart), giving a square planar molecular structure that minimizes lone            pair-lone pair repulsions.

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the            atoms.

Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular            formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine                (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent            distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the            element titanium.
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the            molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
If we know a compounds formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives            vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

18,2084,2084,104,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Quantum Numbers,"The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons inatoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theoryprovides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor tochemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energylevels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in anatom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values andcan jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or staybetween these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n =, 2, 3, . Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greaterfor greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum numberquantum number specifying the shell an electron occupies in an atom. The principlequantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially thesame concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for theprincipal quantum number is the shell number. The shellsset of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n of an atom can bethought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons thatbelong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the correspondingcircular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shellnumber, and so the higher the energy level. The positively charged protons inthe nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attractionbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of theelectrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater theenergy it has.

The principal quantum number, n, is one of three quantumnumbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbitalmathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables, which is distinctfrom an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is mostprobable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability offinding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and isbased on solutions of the Schrdinger equation. In addition, the principlequantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-likeatom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general regionin which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ionsare located. The values for n can be positive wholenumbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...

Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantumquantum number distinguishing the different shapes of orbitals; it is also a measure of the orbital angular momentumnumber. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on thevalues, l = 0, 1, 2, , n  1.This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only onevalue of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number definesthe general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape ofthe orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshellset of orbitals in an atom with the same values of n and l. In addition, thegreater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentumof an electron at this orbital.

Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitalsspherical region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 0. An electron in this orbital is called an s electron (or the ssubshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitalsdumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a p electron. The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitalsregion of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2. An electron in this orbital is called a d electron, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitalsmultilobed region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 3. An electron in this orbital is called an f electron for l =, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider.

The subshell which exist within the shells exhibit different shapes of electron densitya measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function . The value of the Magnetic Quantum Number, ml, indicates the region that an electron occupieswithin a subshell based on the shape of the subshell.
a measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function 
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical, as seen in the diagrambelow.
For the s subshell there is only one region, the sphere, in which an electroncan reside. Therefore in the s subshell there is only one value for ml, which is designated 0. Each region ofelectron density of a subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. Since the ssubshell only has one region of electron density the maximum number of electronsfor any s subshell is 2.
The shape of the p sublevel is more complex than the s sublevel, consisting of 3dumbbell-shaped orbitals originating from a center origin and along the x, y, and z axis as seen in the diagram below.
Within a p subshell electrons may reside in one of the three dumbbell-shapedregions. Therefore, within the p subshell there are three possible values forml, which are -1, 0, 1. Because there are three regions ofelectron density in a p subshell, a maximum of 6 electrons can occupy any psubshell.
The shape of the d subshell is even more complex as seen in the diagram below.Describing the exact shape of the regions of electron density is not importantfor our purposes, but you do need to recognize there are a total of five regionsof electron density within this subshell. Therefore for the d subshell, thereare five possible values for ml which are designated -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.The five regions of electron density, indicate that any d subshell can hold 10electrons.
As you might expect, the shapes of the regions of electron density are even morecomplex within the f subshell. Again, knowing the specific of the shapes is notimportant for our purposes, however you should recognize that there are sevenregions of electron density. Therefore there are seven possible values forml within the f subshell, which are designated -3, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A maximum of 14 electrons can occupy the seven regions ofelectron density in a f subshell.

19,1195,1195,65,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Enthalpy of Combustion,"Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the                    reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a                    commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the                    determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the                    IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions                    at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list                    values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the \xceH of                    a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure (1 bar =                    0.987 atm), \xceH values (except for the most precisely                    measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard                    conditions. We will include a superscripted cod in the enthalpy change symbol to                    designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard)                    temperature is 298.15 K, we will use a subscripted d to designate this                    temperature. Thus, the symbol                                                     Δ                                                            H                                298                                o                                                                         is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under                    these conditions. (The symbol \xceH is used to indicate an                    enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)
The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are                    available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions,                    phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it                    is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy                    changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the                    amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the                    \xceH for specific amounts of reactants). However, we                    often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (\xceH) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive                    value of \xceH, often cnormalizedd to a per-mole basis.                    (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat                    from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)
Standard enthalpy of combustion (                                    Δ                                            H                        C                        o                                                 ) is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously            with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called cheat of            combustion.d For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, .8 kJ/mol, is the            amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at 25 C            and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at 25 C and 1 atm.
Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are            listed in the table below. Many readily available substances with large enthalpies of            combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as coal or charcoal), and            hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane,            and the major components of gasoline.
As seen in the image below, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic                process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L                of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of                isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692                g/mL.
Starting with a known amount (1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions                between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy                of combustion of isooctane provides one of the necessary conversions. The table                above gives this value as  kJ per 1 mole of isooctane                    (C8H18).
The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This is alot of                energy; it is enough to melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)",,reaction,what changes to the reactants and products at the same time?,0,0,0.0,75.33452606201172

Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they                    take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also                    matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would stay collapsed rather                    than inflate when filled with gas.

(In zero gravity,                    liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes                    that are very nearly independent of pressure.

Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases                    at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small                    pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is                    composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of                    more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to                    behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny                    particles of water (liquid or solid).
A fourth state of matter, plasma                                                                        A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.                                                            , occurs naturally in the interiors of stars and                    other high temperature situations. Like gases, plasmas are less dense than                    liquids or solids and do not have a fixed shape or volume. But unlike gases,                    plasmas contain significant amounts of electrically charged particles that are                    able to move freely. Due to these mobile charged particles, plasmas are very                    conductive and highly responsive to external electric or magnetic fields. In                    addition to stars, plasmas are found in neon signs, plasma TVs, lightning and                    the plasma torch (shown in the image below being used to cut through metal).
A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.
The                         mass                                                                                    The measure of the amount of matter of an object.                                                                         of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to                    measure an objects mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the                    object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the                    car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is                    to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.
The measure of the amount of matter of an object.
Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing.                         Weight                                                                                    The force that gravity exerts on an object.                                                                         refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is                    directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes                    as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronauts mass does                    not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only                    one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moons gravity is only one-sixth                    that of the earths.
The force that gravity exerts on an object.
The                         law of conservation of matter                                                                                    There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.                                                                         summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that                    there is no change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts                    from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or                    gaseous states (a physical change). This can be seen in a lead-acid car battery:                    The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable                    of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and                    water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of                    matter.
There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.
Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter,                    convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled                    conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is                    produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and                    assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But                    because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted                    as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.

21,1938,1938,97,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Equations for Ionic Reactions,"Given the abundance of water on earth, it stands to reason that a great many chemical            reactions take place in aqueous media. When ions are involved in these reactions, the            chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail appropriate to their            intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking            place in an aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and                AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous                Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl:
This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation            because it doesnt explicitly represent the ionic species that are present in solution.            When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate into their constituent ions,            which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a            thorough discussion of this important process is provided later in the course). Ionic            compounds dissolved in water are, therefore, more realistically represented as            dissociated ions, in this case:
Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant            extent, as signified by its physical state notation, s.
Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this            particular case, the formulas for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas            for their dissociated ions:
Examining this equation shows that two chemical species are present in identical form on            both sides of the arrow, Ca2+(aq) and NO3(aq). These                 spectator ions                                                            An ion that remains unchanged from the reactant to the products side of                            an equation.                                                 ions whose presence is required to maintain charge neutralityare neither            chemically nor physically changed by the process, and so they may be eliminated from the            equation to yield a more succinct representation called a                 net ionic equation                                                            A chemical equation written such that all dissociated ions are shown as                            such in the equation.                                                :

Following the convention of using the smallest possible integers as coefficients, this            equation is then written:
This net ionic equation indicates that solid silver chloride may be produced from            dissolved chloride and silver(I) ions, regardless of the source of these ions. These            molecular and complete ionic equations provide additional information, namely, the ionic            compounds used as sources of Cl and Ag+.

Balance is achieved easily in this case by changing the coefficient for NaOH to 2,                resulting in the molecular equation for this reaction:

22,1600,1600,79,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,The Mole,"The moleamount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12 is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It            provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of            matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of            discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a            sample of pure 12C weighing exactly 12 g. The mole provides                a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely                important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.
amount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12
The number of entities composing a mole is defined to be            6.02214179×1023, a fundamental constant named Avogadros number                (NA)defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo            Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of cper mole,d a            conveniently rounded version being 6.022×1023/mol.
defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole
Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the            same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. For example 1 mole of carbon            contains 6.022×1023 atoms of carbon and 1 mole of phosphorus contains 6.022×1023             atoms of phosphorus. The masses of 1 mole of different elements,            however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically            different. The molar massmass in grams of 1 mole of a substance of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of            that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). Because the            definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference            substance, 12C, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to            its atomic or formula weight in amu. The molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol (same value            as its atomic mass) and the molar mass of phosphorus is 30.97 g/mol (same value as its            atomic mass).
mass in grams of 1 mole of a substance
While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are            vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the            magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the            mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g. Although this represents            just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (approximately 18 g), it contains more water            molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among            the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100            billion molecules.
As we discussed, the molar mass of an element is numerically the same value as                    the atomic mass of that element listed on the periodic table. Likewise, the                    molar mass of a compound is numerically the same value as the formula mass for                    that compound. For example, the formula mass of NaCl is 58.44 amu. Therefore the                    molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g and the number of NaCl units is 6.022×1023.                         The formula mass of water H2O is 18.02 amu.                    Therefore the molar mass of water is 18.02 g and the number of water molecules                    in one mole of water is 6.022×1023.
*Note that one unit of a molecular(covalent) compound is referred to as a                    molecule. However, one unit of a ionic compound is referred to as a formula                    unit.

23,1506,1506,76,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Mole Fraction and Molality,"Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were            introduced earlier, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications.            For example, molarity (M) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations,            since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species:
Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary.            When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of            solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the            contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many            colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent            on temperature. Two such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous unit on            gases) and molality.
The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the                    total number of moles of all solution components:
Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of                    solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms:
Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with            temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring            temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as            will be described in this module.
The antifreeze in most automobile radiators is a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene                glycol and water, with minor amounts of other additives that prevent corrosion. What                are the (a) mole fraction and (b) molality of ethylene glycol,                    C2H4(OH)2, in a solution prepared from 2.22                     103 g of ethylene glycol and 2.00  103 g of water                (approximately 2 L of glycol and 2 L of water)?
(a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar                amounts of both solution components and then substituting these amounts into the                unit definition.
Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties                with identical units (moles).
(b) To find molality, we need to know the moles of the solute and the mass of the                solvent (in kg).
First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of                solute:
Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms:
Finally, calculate molarity per its definition:
Calculate the mole fraction of solute and solvent in a 2.80 m solution of sodium                chloride.
Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing                the two unit definitions. In this case, both units have the same numerator (moles of                solute) but different denominators. The provided molal concentration may be written                as:
The numerator for this solutions mole fraction is, therefore, 2.80 mol NaCl. The                denominator may be computed by deriving the molar amount of water corresponding to                1.00 kg
and then substituting these molar amounts into the definition for mole fraction.
Note that the sum of the mole fraction of NaCl and the mole fraction of H2O is 1 (0.952 + 0.0480 = 1.000). This is true in general - the sum of the mole fractions of the solution components always equals 1.

24,327,327,28,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Chemical Equations,"Previously we introduced the use of element symbols to represent individual atoms. Whenatoms gain or lose electrons to yield ions, or combine with other atoms to formmolecules, their symbols are modified or combined to generate chemical formulas thatappropriately represent these species. Extending this symbolism to represent both theidentities and the relative quantities of substances undergoing a chemical (or physical)change involves writing and balancing a chemical equationsymbolic representation of a chemical reaction. Consider as an example the reaction between one methane molecule(CH4) and two diatomic oxygen molecules (O2) to produce onecarbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two water molecules (H2O). Thechemical equation representing this process is provided in the upper half of the figurebelow, with space-filling molecular models shown in the lower half of the figure.
symbolic representation of a chemical reaction
This example illustrates the fundamental aspects of any chemical equation:
The substances undergoing reaction are called reactantssubstances undergoing a chemical or physical change; shown on the leftside of the arrow in a chemical equation, and their formulas are placed on the left side of the equation.
substances undergoing a chemical or physical change; shown on the leftside of the arrow in a chemical equation
The substances generated by the reaction are called productssubstances formed by a chemical or physical change; shown on the rightside of the arrow in a chemical equation, and their formulas are placed on the right side of the equation.
substances formed by a chemical or physical change; shown on the rightside of the arrow in a chemical equation
Plus signs (+) separate individual reactant and product formulas, and an arrow (f)separates the reactant and product (left and right) sides of the equation.
The relative numbers of reactant and product species are represented by coefficientsnumbers placed in front of symbols or formulas in a chemical equation toindicate their relative amount(numbers placed immediately to the left of each formula). A coefficient of 1is typically omitted.
numbers placed in front of symbols or formulas in a chemical equation toindicate their relative amount
It is common practice to use the smallest possible whole-number coefficients in achemical equation, as is done in this example. Realize, however, that these coefficientsrepresent the relative numbers of reactants and products, and, therefore, they may becorrectly interpreted as ratios. Methane and oxygen react to yield carbon dioxide andwater in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. This ratio is satisfied if the numbers of these molecules are,respectively, 1-2-1-2, or 2-4-2-4, or 3-6-3-6, and so on. Likewise, these coefficientsmay be interpreted with regard to any amount (number) unit, and so this equation may becorrectly read in many ways, including:
One methane molecule and two oxygen molecules react to yield one carbon dioxide moleculeand two water molecules.
One dozen methane molecules and two dozen oxygen molecules react to yield one dozencarbon dioxide molecules and two dozen water molecules.
One mole of methane molecules and 2 moles of oxygen molecules react to yield 1 mole ofcarbon dioxide molecules and 2 moles of water molecules.

25,2534,2534,123,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment,"As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing            electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (\xce+) and the other            atom with a partial negative charge (\xce), as the electrons are pulled toward the more            electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole momentseparation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector. The            magnitude of a bond dipole momentproperty of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure is represented by the Greek letter mu () and is given            by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined            by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:
separation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector
property of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure
This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and            magnitude. Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less            electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on            the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The            length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference            between the two atoms.
A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular            structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the            molecule is said to be a polar molecule(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to            be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the            molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in            three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.
(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment
For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the            molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and                N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is            zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF,            there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in            electronegativity.
When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If            the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum            equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO2.            Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis            structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is            linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments            cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water            molecule, the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom,            and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero            bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone            pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net            dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).
The OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO2, but a sulfur atom has            replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the            molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:
The C-O bond is considerably polar. Although C and S have very similar electronegativity            values, S is slightly more electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly            polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, the oxygen end of the            molecule is the negative end. The OCS molecule is polar.
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, is another example of a polar molecule. Although the            polar CCl and CH bonds are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry, the CCl bonds have a            larger bond moment than the CH bond, and the bond moments do not completely cancel each            other. All of the dipoles have a downward component in the orientation shown, since            carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and less electronegative than chlorine. The                CH3Cl molecule is polar.
When we examine the highly symmetrical molecules BF3 (trigonal planar), CH4            (tetrahedral), PF5 (trigonal bipyramidal), and SF6 (octahedral), in which all            the polar bonds are identical, the molecules are nonpolar. The bonds in these molecules            are arranged such that their dipoles cancel. However, just because a molecule contains            identical bonds does not mean that the dipoles will always cancel. Many molecules that            have identical bonds and lone pairs on the central atoms have bond dipoles that do not            cancel because their molecular shape is not symmetrical. Examples include H2S and NH3. A            hydrogen atom is at the positive end and a nitrogen or sulfur atom is at the negative            end of the polar bonds in these molecules:
To summarize, to be polar, a molecule must:
Polar molecules tend to align when placed in an electric field with the positive                    end of the molecule oriented toward the negative plate and the negative end                    toward the positive plate. We can use an electrically charged object to attract                    polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents                    are better at dissolving polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at                    dissolving nonpolar substances.

26,3722,3722,179,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Bonding in Diatomic Molecules,"A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the                    atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular                    orbital of lowest energy, the s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,                        H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule                    is lower than that of two H atoms. The s orbital that contains both                    electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.
A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the                        H2 molecule are in the s bonding orbital; the electron                    configuration is (s)2. We represent this configuration                    by a molecular orbital energy diagram seen below in which a single upward arrow                    indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows                    indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons                    so we have
Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single                    bond.
A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium                    atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule, He2, with four                    electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the                    lower-energy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the                    two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital. We would write                    the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as                        (s)2(s)2 as seen in the                    diagram below The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force                    for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as                    discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a                    hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero.
A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.
Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the                    second period of the periodic table: Li2, Be2,                        B2, C2, N2, O2, F2,                    and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the                        Ne2 molecule would not be stable. We can see this by a                    consideration of the molecular electron configurations in the table below.
We predict ground state valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict                    electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence                    molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hunds                    rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons                    fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes                    place.
As we saw in valence bond theory,  bonds are generally more stable than  bonds                    formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory,                     orbitals are usually more stable than  orbitals. However, this is not always                    the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in                    below. Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is                    consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for                    atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe                    a different pattern, in which the p orbital is higher in energy than                    the p set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear                    diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral                    molecule.
This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing.                    s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of                    the existing molecular orbitals. The s wavefunction mathematically combines                    with the p wavefunction, with the result that the s orbital becomes                    more stable, and the p orbital becomes less stable, as seen int the                    energy diagram below. Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p                    mixing, with the \\(\\sigma_s^\\ast\\) becoming more stable and the \\(\\sigma_p^\\ast\\)                    becoming less stable.
s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. The energy                    difference between 2s and 2p orbitals in O, F, and Ne is greater than that in                    Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and                        Ne2 exhibit negligible s-p mixing (not sufficient to change the                    energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown                    above. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which                    leads to the pattern where the p orbital is raised above the                        p set.
Using the MO diagrams shown, we can add in the electrons and determine the                    molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic                    molecules. As shown in the table above, Be2 and Ne2                    molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.
The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li2,                    is analogous to the formation of H2, but the atomic orbitals involved                    are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence                    electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the s                    bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding                    orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule                    is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at                    temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules                    in the table above with a bond order greater than zero are also known.
The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the                        (py,pz) level. We expect the two electrons that                    occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular                    electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the fact that the                    oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons, as seen in the energy diagram in the                    example below. The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult                    to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it                    quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a                    strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.
Draw the molecular orbital diagram for the oxygen molecule, O2.                        From this diagram, calculate the bond order for O2. How does this                        diagram account for the paramagnetism of O2?
We draw a molecular orbital energy diagram. Each oxygen atom contributes six                        electrons, so the diagram appears as shown below.
We calculate the bond order as
Oxygen\'s paramagnetism is explained by the presence of two unpaired electrons                        in the (py, pz)* molecular orbitals.
Give the molecular orbital configuration for the valence electrons in                            C22. Will this ion be stable?
Looking at the appropriate MO diagram, we see that the  orbitals are lower                        in energy than the p orbital. The valence electron configuration                        for C2 is                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4.                        Adding two more electrons to generate the C22 anion will give a                        valence electron configuration of                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4(px)2.                        Since this has six more bonding electrons than antibonding, the bond order                        will be 3, and the ion should be stable.

27,3380,3380,164,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Modern Atomic Theory,"The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms.            It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleusmassive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons composed of positively charged            protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing            negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atoms mass            because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy            almost all of an atoms volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of                10 m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10-15            mabout 100,000 times smaller.
massive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons
For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size            of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium.
Atomsand the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose themare extremely small. For            example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2  10 g. When describing the            properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure.            The atomic mass unit (amu) is the unit of mass that is used for masses of atoms,            molecules, and subatomic particles. The amu is defined with regard to the most abundant            isotope of carbon, carbon. An atom of carbon contains 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6            electrons. (Isotopes will be discussed in more detail in the next module). The mass of a            carbon atom is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. Thus, one amu is exactly 1/12 of the            mass of one carbon atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 x 10 g.
The charge of subatomic particles is also extremely small. Like the amu, an appropriately            small unit of charge has been developed to describe the charge of subatomic particles.            An electron has a charge of less than 2  C (coulomb). The fundamental            unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of            an electron (e) with e = 1.602 x 10 C.
A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier            particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is            neutral. The electron has a charge of 1 and is a much lighter particle with a mass of            about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton).            The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in table below.
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number (Z). This is the            defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For            example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic            number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must            contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons            equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number            of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called            its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass            number and the atomic number: A  Z = number of neutrons.

Atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged            protons and negatively charged electrons.

28,2179,2179,108,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Quantized Energy and the Photoelectric Effect,"One observation that could not be adequately explained by viewing light as waves                    is the light emitted as objects are heated. The wavelengths and intensities of the                     objects energy distribution can be measured by a spectrometer, and each distribution                     depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. As shown in the figure below,                     the maxima in these spectral distribution curves, \xce\xbbmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as                     the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that as a metal is heated it glows                     red, then orange, yellow, and eventually white (as the intensities of all of the visible                     wavelengths become appreciable at very high temperatures). This common observation was                          at the heart of the first paradox showing the fundamental limitations of classical physics                     that we will examine.
Using the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism, which held that electromagnetic waves                     could have any frequency within a continuously varying range, late 19th century scientists derived                     mathematical expressions for these energy distributions. These expressions fit the observed experimental                     blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths but diverged more and more as the wavelength became shorter,                    with the absurd consequence of infinitely large energies as the wavelength approached zero. This became                     known as the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"", since it implied that everyday objects at room temperature should                     be emitting large amounts of UV light and no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment                     that led to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.
Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for this phenomenon that                    fit the experimental observations. Planck treated the vibrating atoms as the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation                    (a premise from previous work), but instead of allowing the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a                    continuous set of energies (as allowed by classical physics, and as previously thought) Planck proposed that the vibrational                     energies were restricted to a discrete set of values for each frequency (i.e. that energy was quantized).

The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck\'s constant, in his honor.                    Although it appears that energy is emitted and absorbed continuously and not in                    discrete quantities, notice that the value of Planck\'s constant is very small,                    6.626 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy                    quantization is not observed in macroscopic phenomena.
The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the                    photoelectric effect. It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from                    the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than a                    threshold frequency, unique to the type of metal, was shone on it. Since the electrons in the metal had a                    certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed                    to have more energy - and therefore a higher frequency - to free the electrons. This is illustrated in the animation                    below.
According to classical wave theory, a wave\'s energy depends on its intensity                     (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. However, the frequency at which                     electrons start to be emitted from the metal (known as the threshold frequency)                     does not change when the intensity of the light changes. This is illustrated by comparing                     the animation below with the animation above.
Although the threshold frequency doesn\'t change with changes in intensity (brightness) of the light,                     once the threshold is met the number of electrons emitted within a given time period (i.e. the electric                     current) increases with increasing intensity of the light. This is shown in the following two animations.
Along with the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons also does not depend                     on the intensity of the light. However, if the frequency of the light is increased the kinetic energy of                     the electrons increases as well. This is shown in the graph below.
Different metals have different threshold frequencies. As we have seen in the                    previous animations the wavelength of the frequency threshold for sodium is                    approximately 500 nm. As seen in the animation below the wavelength of the                    threshold frequency for calcium is approximately 400 nm.
In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck\'s quantization                     findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work,                     and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).                     Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated could be                    applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the                    metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of                    particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency,                    according to Planck\'s formula, E = h\xce\xbd (or, in terms of wavelength using c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd,                    E = hc/\xce\xbb).
Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency                    greater than the threshold). Einstein also argued that the light intensity did                    not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to                    the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This                    explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing                    brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the                    likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.
With Einstein\'s findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Some                    phenomena could be explained by viewing light as a wave and other phenomena,                    such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by viewing light as a                    particle. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light                    is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality.
When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon                atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the                photon being emitted?
We use the part of Planck\'s equation that includes the wavelength, h\xce\xbd\xce\xbb, and convert                units of nanometers to meters so that the units of \xce\xbb correspond to the length units of c.

29,4858,4858,264,Gases,Gas Laws,Module Summary and Quiz,"The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations            of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to            its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Gay-Lussac\'s law).            The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at            constant pressure (Charless law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely            proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyles law). Under the            same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same            number of molecules (Avogadros law).
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the            gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

30,2262,2262,110,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Simple Cubic Unit Cells,"Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids            are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of their particles because            the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total            intermolecular energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient            manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level is often reflected at a macroscopic            level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of            metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined            experimentally.
We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids             by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple because each contains only             one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely             together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as             their malleability and ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in             a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to another partially             depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We             will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal             geometries in the sections that follow.
The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a            metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is            referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent            the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell            repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in the figure below.
A unit cell shows the locations of                lattice points repeating in all directions.
Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice            structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit            cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as            tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this            would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in            the layer below, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called simple            cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive            cubic unit cell.
When metal atoms are arranged with                spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the                lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in                contact.
In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not            packed as closely as they could be, and they only cfilld about 52% of the volume of the            container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium,            Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in the figure below a solid with            this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only            the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above;            and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that            each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a            polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.
An atom in a simple cubic lattice                structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of                six.
In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that            repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms, as shown            below. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge            length of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit            cell contains only the parts of these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a            corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only            one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit            cell has one atom at each of its eight ccorners,d there is \\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom            within one simple cubic unit cell.
A simple cubic lattice unit cell                contains one-eighth of an atom at each of its eight corners, so it contains one                atom total.
The edge length of the unit cell of alpha                polonium is 336 pm.
(a) Determine the radius of a polonium atom.
(b) Determine the density of alpha polonium.
Alpha polonium crystallizes in a simple cubic                unit cell:
(a) Two adjacent Po atoms contact each other,                so the edge length of this cell is equal to two Po atomic radii: l = 2r. Therefore,                the radius of Po is:
r\\;=\\;\\frac                l2=\\frac{336\\;\\mathrm{pm}}2=168\\;\\mathrm{pm}
(b) Density is given by \\(                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) The density of polonium can be found by                determining the density of its unit cell (the mass contained within a unit cell                divided by the volume of the unit cell). Since a Po unit cell contains one-eighth of                a Po atom at each of its eight corners, a unit cell contains one Po atom.
The mass of a Po unit cell can be found by:

(Note that the edge length was converted from                pm to cm to get the usual volume units for density.)

31,4800,4800,253,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,IMFs and Properties of Liquids,"When you pour a glass of water, or fill a car with gasoline, you observe that                    water and gasoline flow freely. But when you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil                    to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The                    viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline,                    and other liquids that flow freely have a low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor                    oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown below, have                    higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a                    metal ball falls through a liquid (the ball falls more slowly through a more                    viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a                    narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly).
The IMFs between the molecules of a liquid, the size and shape of the molecules,                    and the temperature determine how easily a liquid flows. As the table below                    shows, the more structurally complex are the molecules in a liquid and the                    stronger the IMFs between them, the more difficult it is for them to move past                    each other and the greater is the viscosity of the liquid. As the temperature                    increases, the molecules move more rapidly and their kinetic energies are better                    able to overcome the forces that hold them together; thus, the viscosity of the                    liquid decreases.
The various IMFs between identical molecules of a substance are examples of                    cohesive forces. The molecules within a liquid are surrounded by other molecules                    and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within the                    liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by                    about one-half as many molecules. Because of the unbalanced molecular                    attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that                    minimizes the number of molecules on the surfacethat is, the shape with the                    minimum surface area. A small drop of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape,                    as shown below, because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area to volume is                    at a minimum.
Surface tension is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of                    a liquid, or the force required to increase the length of a liquid surface by a                    given amount. This property results from the cohesive forces between molecules                    at the surface of a liquid, and it causes the surface of a liquid to behave like                    a stretched rubber membrane. Surface tensions of several liquids are presented                    in the table below.
Among common liquids, water exhibits a distinctly high surface tension due to                    strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. As a result of this high surface                    tension, the surface of water represents a relatively ctough skind that can                    withstand considerable force without breaking. A steel needle carefully placed                    on water will float. Some insects, like the one shown in Figure, even though                    they are denser than water, move on its surface because they are supported by                    the surface tension.
The IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called                            adhesive forces.  When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus                            (surface) has a concave shape because the water wets the glass and                            creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces                            between mercury atoms are much greater than the adhesive forces between                            mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass, and it forms a                            convex meniscus when confined in a tube because the cohesive forces                            within the mercury tend to draw it into a drop.
If you place one end of a paper towel in spilled wine, as shown below                           , the liquid wicks up the paper towel. A similar process occurs in                            a cloth towel when you use it to dry off after a shower. These are                            examples of capillary actionwhen a liquid flows within a porous                            material due to the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of                            the material and to other liquid molecules. The adhesive forces between                            the liquid and the porous material, combined with the cohesive forces                            within the liquid, may be strong enough to move the liquid upward                            against gravity.
Towels soak up liquids like water because the fibers of a towel are made                            of molecules that are attracted to water molecules. Most cloth towels                            are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp.                            Both consist of long molecules of cellulose that contain many OH                            groups. Water molecules are attracted to these OH groups and form                            hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose                            molecules. The water molecules are also attracted to each other, so                            large amounts of water are drawn up the cellulose fibers.
Capillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is                            immersed in a liquid, as illustrated below. If the liquid molecules                            are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the                            inside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive                            forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the                            higher the liquid climbs.

33,399,399,32,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Electromagnetic Energy,"Electromagnetic energy is transmitted by waves that have electric and magnetic fields            oscillating perpendicularly from each other and from the direction the wave propagates            or travels, as seen in the animatation below. The electromagnetic spectrum contains waves with a continuous range of            energies, frequencies and wavelengths. There are different classifications for the            electromagnetic waves in the spectrum, many of which you are likely familiar with            including: visible light, cell phone signals, microwaves, X-rays, infrared (IR)            radiation, and gamma rays.
Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation. For example, radio            waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food in your            microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television            screen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.
Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in            chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and            molecules. In this section we will explore the nature of electromagnetic energy, and            in following sections we will see how the theories about electromagnetic energy are used            to help describe the electronic structure of the atom.

34,1261,1261,67,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Heating and Cooling Curves,"In the unit on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or            released by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature            change, \xceT, was introduced:
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,            but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a            temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat            is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of            increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a            change in state, its temperature remains constant.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply            heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the waters            temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant            despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is            maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to            provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the            boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase            transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state            is in progress.
The slide show below shows the change in temperature that occurs when a constant source            of heat is added to ice with an initial temperature of -10.0 oC. The resulting graph is            known as a heating curve.
How much heat is required to convert 135 g of ice at  C into water vapor at 120                C?
The transition described involves the following steps:
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in                phase) is: q = m  c  \xceT (see previous chapter on                thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given by q = n  \xceH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water,                and steam, and enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, we have:
Converting the quantities in J to kJ permits them to be summed, yielding the total                heat required:
The values below for water are used in the following example:
Calculate the heat required to convert 25.0 g solid ethanol at -135.0 oC                to liquid at 72.0 oC. Specific heat of solid ethanol = 0.97 J/g                    oC. Specific heat liquid ethanol 2.3 J/ g oC.
\xceHfus of ethanol = 4.9 kJ/mol

35,2901,2901,138,Solutions,Solubility,Solubility,"Imagine adding a small amount of salt to a glass of water, stirring until all the salt            has dissolved, and then adding a bit more. You can repeat this process until the salt            concentration of the solution reaches its natural limit, a limit determined primarily by            the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent            attractive forces. You can be certain that you have reached this limit because, no            matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved salt remains. The concentration of            salt in the solution at this point is known as its solubility.
The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may            be achieved under given conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium.            Referring to the example of salt in water:
When a solutes concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be            saturated with that solute. If the solutes concentration is less than its solubility,            the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that contains a relatively low            concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration            is called concentrated.
If we add more salt to a saturated solution of salt, we see it fall to the bottom and no            more seems to dissolve. In fact, the added salt does dissolve, as represented by the            forward direction of the dissolution equation. Accompanying this process, dissolved salt            will precipitate, as depicted by the reverse direction of the equation. The system is            said to be at equilibrium when these two reciprocal processes are occurring at equal            rates, and so the amount of undissolved and dissolved salt remains constant.
Solutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such            solutions are said to be supersaturated, and they are interesting examples of            nonequilibrium states. For example, the carbonated beverage in an open container that            has not yet cgone flatd is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO2            concentration will decrease until it reaches its equilibrium value. A video showing the crystallization of             two supersaturated solutions of sodium acetate is shown below.

36,144,144,17,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Module Summary and Quiz,"Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry.                Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be                represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use the SI (International System)                or metric systems. We use base SI units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units,                such as liters (for volume) and g/cm3 (for density). In many cases, we find it convenient to use unit prefixes                that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10-6 seconds) and megahertz (106 hertz),                respectively.
Quantities can be exact or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number                of significant figures in the measurement. The uncertainty of a calculated value depends on the uncertainties in                the values used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Measured values can be accurate                (close to the true value) and/or precise (showing little variation when measured repeatedly).
Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured                quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors,                which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or                dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured                quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.

37,1276,1276,68,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Heat Capacity and Specific Heat,"Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorieunit of heat or other energy; the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius; 1 cal is defined as 4.184 J is the amount of            energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this            quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water.            The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is            still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used            in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and            energy is the jouleSI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of            1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James            Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is            also called 1 newtonmeter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its            definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change: heat            capacity and specific heat capacity.
The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of                            heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change                            (\xceT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):
Heat capacityextensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs                    or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive propertyits value is                    proportional to the amount of the substance.
extensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans.
The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small                    pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large                    pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more                    atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of                    those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan                    is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature                    of the pan by 50.0 C:
The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires                    90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 C. The larger pan has a                    (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material                    requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same                    temperature change:
The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its cspecific                            heat,d is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram                            of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):
Specific heat capacityintensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or                    releasing heat. It is an intensive propertythe type, but not the amount, of the                    substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a                    mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is                    therefore:
intensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can                    also calculate the specific heat of iron:
Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of                    the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the                    material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of                    energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from                    a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity,                    also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular                    substance and has units of J/mol C.",,properties,what does heat capacity consist of?,1,1,0.0,304.42401123046875
38,212,212,22,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Module Summary and Quiz,"Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass                    numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the                    number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is                    composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the                    average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the                    atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, or two-letter                     abbreviations for the atoms.
A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact                    numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives                    the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula                    indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick                    and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements                    of atoms.
The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements                    led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged                    in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known                    as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar                    chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and                    nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition                    metals. Groups are numbered 1 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are                    known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals;                    those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are                    the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.
Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of                    electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the                    preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged                    ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and,                    to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed                    to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in                    the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively                    charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions.                    Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic                    (containing more than one atom).
Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally                    form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead                    consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms                    that behave as a single unit), are called covalent or molecular compounds. Covalent compounds                    usually form from two nonmetals.
Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular                    compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds                    typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written                    first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to ide. For                    example, K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and                        FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule                    of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and                        N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the ide suffix to ic,                    and adding cacid;d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the                    ending of the anion to ic, and adding cacid;d H2CO3 is                    carbonic acid.

39,4943,4943,269,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Temperature Conversions,"We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change             in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract             when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume             as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we             can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler.
To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the             freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, at a pressure of 1.0 atm, 0 °C             is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 °C as the boiling temperature of water. The space             between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit             scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 °F and the boiling temperature as 212 °F. The space between             these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).
Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a             slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units             of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to             one another (y = mx).

To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit             scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature             that can theoretically be achieved. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas\'s volume and             temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at .15 °C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson,             who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment             of this topic is provided later in this course).  A degree Celsius is the same size as  a Kelvin.

Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in             many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world. Very             few countries (the U.S. and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, and Palau) still use Fahrenheit             for weather, medicine, and cooking.

40,810,810,52,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Introduction to Valence Bond Theory,"As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural            laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain            experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained            widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are            consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules.            However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.
There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use            quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are            likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p            orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free            atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe            the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete            understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the            electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms            when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the            nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are            described by valence bond theory and hybridization.
Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled                    atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of                    electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two                    different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second                    orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a                    covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom                    overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each                    orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this                    negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei                    serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent                    bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the                    orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are                    stronger than those that have less overlap.
The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. The slideshow                    below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored                    curve) changes as they approach each other.
The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the                    bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity                    of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of                    energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in the                    slideshow, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is 7.24  10 J lower in                    energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number.                    However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond                    energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24                     10 J to break one HH bond, but it takes 4.36  105 J to break 1 mole of                    HH bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in the table                    below. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table                    provides average values. For example, breaking the first CH bond in CH4, methane,                     requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first CH bond in H (toluene, a common                    paint thinner) requires 375.5 kJ/mol.

41,3241,3241,156,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Dipole-Dipole Attractions,"Recall from the unit on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that polar molecules have            a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of            the moleculea separation of charge called a dipole. Consider a polar molecule such as            hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl atom bears the            partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial            positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction            between the positive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This            attractive force is called a dipole-dipole attractionthe electrostatic force between            the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of            another, as illustrated below.
The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of            HCl molecules to nonpolar F2 molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of            the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass. At a            temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE.            However, the dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause            them to cstick togetherd to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion            forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are not, and so this substance is            gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to                F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole            attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar                F2 molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing            points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths            of IMFs of attraction present within different substances.
Predict which will have the higher boiling point: N2 or CO. Explain your                reasoning.
CO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience                similar London dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences                dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit                dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO molecules are                comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO                is expected to have the higher boiling point.

42,557,557,42,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,How to Use the OLI Course,"This course is thoughtfully designed (relying heavily on research-based principles of            learning science) to guide you through your learning of General                 Chemistry. Understanding how and why the course is set-up as it is will help you better            utilize all aspects of the course and allow you to more successfully and efficiently learn            the concepts.
One of the first things you will notice as you begin is that at the top of every                    core content page there are one or more learning objectives.
Learning Objectives appear at the top of the page to guide your learning.
These learning objectives are intended to guide you as to what you should be                    accomplishing on that page(s). It is a good idea to make a mental note of, or even write                    down, these learning objectives and reflect on them as you are going through the                    content. Ask yourself, ""Am I achieving this objective?""
There are many activities throughout this course. The activities are                    designed to more fully engage you in the learning process. You will notice there                    are two categories of activities within the modules: Learn By                        Doing and Did I Get This. These types of                    activities are designed in different ways, each for a unique purpose.
The Learn By Doing activities are designed to                            scaffold your learning. They provide significantly more guidance than                            the Did I Get This activities in a number of                            ways. One of the more obvious methods of guidance is hints. You will                            notice that many of these activities have hints. If you are unsure how                            to approach a problem, ask for a hint to guide you. Note that some                            problems have multiple hints.
Learn By Doing activities scaffold practice. Ask for a hint if you are unsure how to progress.
An additional way you will see that Learn By                            Doing activities help to scaffold learning is to present                            problems in a step-by-step manner. Learn By                                Doing activities are usually presented before Did I Get This activities.
Some Learn By Doing activities present problem solving in a                                 step-by-step manner                                 to scaffold practice.                                
The Did I Get This activities are designed to be                            a self-assessment. Problems generally do not include hints and are                            generally not presented in a step-wise manner. This is your opportunity                            to determine after reading through the material and performing the                            numerous activities that preceded, whether or not you ""got"" the concept.                            In the event that you feel that you have not ""gotten"" the concept, it is                            a good idea to go back and review the previous material and/or seek help                            from your instructor.
Did I get this activities allow you to self-assess your understanding before a graded assignment. 
My Response activity links are at the end of each                            module. These activities allow you to reflect on how well you learned                            the concepts presented. Reflecting on your own learning, also know as                            metacognition, is a proven way to promote the                            development of effective learning.
You also have the opportunity to include questions you might have for                            your instructor. Your responses are sent to your instructor and may be                            used in classroom discussions.
Click on the My Response link to reflect on your understanding and provide feedback to your instructor. 
There is a Checkpoint at the end of each module and unit.                                                         This is a graded assignment and the score will be reported to your                            instructor. Your instructor may decide to assign points to your overall grade in                            the course for these assignments.
There are many numeric input problems within this course. For any of                            these you may use standard notation or scientific notation. It is highly                            recommended for very small or very large values that you use scientific                            notation.
For exponents, use the letter e. For example, for 6.022                            enter 6.022e23.

43,2843,2843,135,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules,"Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these            interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange            information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or            feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between            chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to            classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module            will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions:            precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.
A precipitation reactionreaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more)            solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic            compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement,            double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and            are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in            animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and            specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical            analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric            methods for determining the composition of matter. Watch the video below to see an example of a precipitation reaction.
reaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is            quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a            substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively            large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution            conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with            relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that            readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is            provided later in this course. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids            formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that            have been observed for many ionic compounds. Note that these guidelines are not            comprehensive, they do not cover every possible combination of cations and anions. It is            a good idea to memorize these guidelines.
Determine the solubility of the following compounds:
a) AgNO3
b) BaSO4
c) CaCO3
a) Nitrates are always soluble.
b) While sulfate compounds are often soluble, exceptions include: Ag+,                    Hg22+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Sr2+,                    Ba2+
c) Carbonate compounds are insoluble unless combined with a cation that is always                soluble.
We use these solubility rules to predict whether or not a precipitation reaction will            occur between two ionic compounds. A vivid example of precipitation is observed when            solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of            solid lead(II) iodide:
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble            compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general            solubility of iodide salts.
The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:
Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artists pigment known            as iodine yellow. The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for            fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
In order to determine whether or not a precipitation reaction will occur one needs to            identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion            pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver            nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing Ag+,                NO3, Na+, and F ions. Aside from the            two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two            additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3            and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgF            is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation            reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
potassium sulfate and barium nitrate
K+, SO42, Ba2+,                        NO3
KNO3 and BaSO4
If any of the possible products are insoluble a precipitate will form.
This reaction will form a precipitate of BaSO4. Therefore, the net ionic                equation is:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
sodium carbonate and ammonium nitrate
Na+, CO32, NH4+,                        NO3
NaNO3 and (NH4)2CO3
If all possible products are soluble, no reaction occurs.
The ions present in the reactants will remain unchanged when these two aqueous                solutions are combined. No reaction will occur.

44,1558,1558,77,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Quantum Mechanics,"Werner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure                    properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that                    there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particles                    position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the                    momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at                    that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg                    uncertainty principle.
It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the                    momentum and the position of a particle.
For a particle of mass m moving with velocity vx in the x direction (or equivalently with momentum px), the product of the uncertainty in the                    position, \xcex, and the uncertainty in the momentum, \xcepx, must be                    greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{\\mathitf}{\}\\) (recall that                    \\(\\mathitf=\\;\\frac h{2\\pi}\\), the value of Plancks constant divided by 2).
\\Delta x \imes \\Delta p_x = (\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq                    \\frac{\\hbar}2
This equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both                    the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we                    improve our measurement of an electrons position so that the uncertainty in the                    position (\xcex) has a value of, say, 1 pm                    (10-12 m, about 1% of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our                    determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at                    least
\\left[ \\Delta p = m \\Delta v = \\frac{h}{2 \\Delta x} \ight] =                    \\frac{(1.055 \imes 10^{-34} \\mathrm{kg}\\                    \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s})}{(2\\^{-12}\\mathrm{m})} = 5 \imes                    10^{-23} \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}
The value of h is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a                    macroscopic object like a baseball is too insignificant to observe. However, the                    mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the                    uncertainty can be large and significant.
Heisenbergs principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.                    The uncertainty principle can be shown to be a consequence of waveparticle                    duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory                    from classical mechanics. Recall that the equations of motion obtained from                    classical mechanics are trajectories where, at any given instant in time, both                    the position and the momentum of a particle can be determined exactly.                    Heisenbergs uncertainty principle implies that such a view is untenable in the                    microscopic domain and that there are fundamental limitations governing the                    motion of quantum particles. This does not mean that microscopic particles do                    not move in trajectories, it is just that measurements of trajectories are                    limited in their precision. In the realm of                         quantum mechanics                                                                                    field of study that includes quantization of energy,                                    wave-particle duality, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle                                    to describe matter                                                                        , measurements introduce changes into the system that is being                    observed.

Shortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom                    could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a                    particle moving in quantized circular orbits, as Bohr had argued, Erwin                    Schrdinger extended de Broglies work by incorporating the de Broglie relation                    into a wave equation, deriving what is today known as the Schrdinger equation.                    When Schrdinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to                    reproduce Bohrs expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula                    governing hydrogen spectra, and he did so without having to invoke Bohrs                    assumptions of stationary states and quantized orbits, angular momenta, and                    energies; quantization in Schrdingers theory was a natural consequence of the                    underlying mathematics of the wave equation.
Like de Broglie, Schrdinger initially viewed the electron in hydrogen as being a                    physical wave instead of a particle, but where de Broglie thought of the                    electron in terms of circular stationary waves, Schrdinger properly thought in                    terms of three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by                    the Greek letter psi, . A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation                    of the                         wavefunction                                                                                     mathematical description of an atomic orbital that describes the                                    shape of the orbital; it can be used to calculate the                                    probability of finding the electron at any given location in the                                    orbital, as well as dynamical variables such as the energy and                                    the angular momentum                                                                         that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the                    waves represented by  are not physical waves but, instead, are complex                    probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction                     describes the probability of the quantum particle being                    present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be                    used to determine the distribution of the electrons density with respect to the                    nucleus in an atom. The general form of the Schrdinger equation is seen                    below.

Schrdingers work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists                    following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.

45,2266,2266,110,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Simple Cubic Unit Cells,"Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids            are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of their particles because            the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total            intermolecular energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient            manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level is often reflected at a macroscopic            level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of            metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined            experimentally.
We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids             by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple because each contains only             one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely             together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as             their malleability and ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in             a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to another partially             depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We             will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal             geometries in the sections that follow.
The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a            metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is            referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent            the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell            repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in the figure below.
A unit cell shows the locations of                lattice points repeating in all directions.
Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice            structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit            cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as            tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this            would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in            the layer below, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called simple            cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive            cubic unit cell.
When metal atoms are arranged with                spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the                lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in                contact.
In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not            packed as closely as they could be, and they only cfilld about 52% of the volume of the            container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium,            Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in the figure below a solid with            this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only            the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above;            and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that            each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a            polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.
An atom in a simple cubic lattice                structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of                six.
In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that            repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms, as shown            below. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge            length of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit            cell contains only the parts of these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a            corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only            one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit            cell has one atom at each of its eight ccorners,d there is \\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom            within one simple cubic unit cell.
A simple cubic lattice unit cell                contains one-eighth of an atom at each of its eight corners, so it contains one                atom total.
The edge length of the unit cell of alpha                polonium is 336 pm.
(a) Determine the radius of a polonium atom.
(b) Determine the density of alpha polonium.
Alpha polonium crystallizes in a simple cubic                unit cell:
(a) Two adjacent Po atoms contact each other,                so the edge length of this cell is equal to two Po atomic radii: l = 2r. Therefore,                the radius of Po is:
r\\;=\\;\\frac                l2=\\frac{336\\;\\mathrm{pm}}2=168\\;\\mathrm{pm}
(b) Density is given by \\(                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) The density of polonium can be found by                determining the density of its unit cell (the mass contained within a unit cell                divided by the volume of the unit cell). Since a Po unit cell contains one-eighth of                a Po atom at each of its eight corners, a unit cell contains one Po atom.
The mass of a Po unit cell can be found by:
1\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}\\;\imes\\;\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{atom}}{1\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}}\imes\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{Po}}{6.022\\;\imes\\;10^{23}\\;\\mathrm{Po}\\;\\mathrm{atoms}}\imes\\frac{208.998\\;\\mathrm                g}{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{Po}}=3.47\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm g\\;
The volume of a Po unit cell can be found                by:
\\mathrm V\\;=\\;                l^3\\;=\\;\\left(336\\;\\mathrm{pm}\imes\\frac{10^{-12}\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{10^{-2}\\;\\mathrm{pm}}\ight)^3\\;=\\;3.79\\;\^{-23}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3
(Note that the edge length was converted from                pm to cm to get the usual volume units for density.)

46,4398,4398,225,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Colligative Properties of Electrolytes,"As noted previously in this module, the colligative properties of a solution depend only            on the number, not on the kind, of solute species dissolved. For example, 1 mole of any            nonelectrolyte dissolved in 1 kilogram of solvent produces the same lowering of the            freezing point as does 1 mole of any other nonelectrolyte. However, 1 mole of sodium            chloride (an electrolyte) forms 2 moles of ions when dissolved in solution. Each            individual ion produces the same effect on the freezing point as a single molecule            does.
The concentration of ions in seawater is approximately the same as that in a solution                containing 4.2 g of NaCl dissolved in 125 g of water. Assume that each of the ions                in the NaCl solution has the same effect on the freezing point of water as a                nonelectrolyte molecule, and determine the freezing temperature the solution (which                is approximately equal to the freezing temperature of seawater).
Convert from grams to moles of NaCl using the molar mass of NaCl in the unit                conversion factor.
Determine the number of moles of ions present in the solution using the number of                moles of ions in 1 mole of NaCl as the conversion factor (2 mol ions/1 mol                NaCl).
Determine the molality of the ions in the solution from the number of moles of ions                and the mass of solvent, in kilograms.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.
Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the                change.
Assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0 m aqueous solution of NaCl contains 2.0 mole of            ions (1.0 mol Na+ and 1.0 mol Cl) per each kilogram of water, and            its freezing point depression is expected to be
When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured,            however, a value of 3.4 C is obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other            ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured and expected colligative            property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase.            These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong            electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in solution.
To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total            dissociation, an experimentally measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning            German chemist Jacobus Henricus vant Hoff is used. The vant Hoff factor (i) is defined            as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units            dissolved:
Values for measured vant Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values            assuming complete dissociation, are shown in the table below.
In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich H\xbcckel proposed a theory to explain the            apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although            interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the            ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The            residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles.          In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a            solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of            any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions            become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual            interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the            effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the            actual concentrations. Note that the vant Hoff factors for the electrolytes in the table above            are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of i for NaCl is 1.9, as            opposed to an ideal value of 2.

47,3680,3680,177,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Theory,"Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the            same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals.            Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by            a wave function, \xce, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around            isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized)            energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be            found is called a molecular orbital (\xce). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular            orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.
We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms                (H2 or Cl2, for example). Such molecules are called            homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular            orbitals occur.
The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is            called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the            wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic            orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which            peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with            troughs, as seen below. In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine            with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and            out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.
There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s            orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated below. The in-phase            combination produces a lower energy s molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s"") in which            most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition            (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher            energy s molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s-star"") molecular orbital in which there            is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding            orbital. Electrons in a s orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are            more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons            to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these            orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the s orbitals are located well away from the            region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these            electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding            orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy            antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill            higher-energy atomic orbitals.
In p orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous            to how a two-dimensional wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate            the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same            phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When            regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron            density and creates nodes. When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create  and *            orbitals. If two atoms are located along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system,            the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form px (bonding) and px (antibonding)            (read as ""sigma-p-x"" and ""sigma-p-x star,"" respectively). Just as with s-orbital            overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a            higher-energy, antibonding orbital.
The side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi () bonding molecular            orbital and a * antibonding molecular orbital, as shown below. In valence bond theory,            we describe  bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and            perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either side of            the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the  orbital by this same shape, and            a  bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact            with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For            the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the            internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.
In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of p            orbitals oriented side by side (py and pz), so these four atomic            orbitals combine pairwise to create two  orbitals and two * orbitals. The py and                py orbitals are oriented at right angles to the pz and pz            orbitals. Except for their orientation, the py and pz orbitals            are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals. The                py and pz antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and            identical except for their orientation. A total of six molecular orbitals results from            the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms: px and                px, py and py, pz and                pz.
Predict what type (if any) of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave                functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap. The orbitals are all similar in                energy.
(a) is an in-phase combination, resulting in a p orbital
(b) will not result in a new orbital because the in-phase component (bottom) and                out-of-phase component (top) cancel out. Only orbitals with the correct alignment                can combine.
(c) is an out-of-phase combination, resulting in a p orbital.

48,1472,1472,75,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Molecular Velocities and Kinetic Energy,"The previous discussion showed that the KMTqualitatively explains the behaviors described by the various gas laws. The postulatesof this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individuallaws. To do this, we must first look at velocities and kinetic energies of gasmolecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.
In a gas sample, individual molecules have widelyvarying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisionsinvolved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. Thismolecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and itdepicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a givenspeed.
The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds. Thenumber of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a maximum, which isthe most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, \xce\xbdp, is a little less than 400 m/s, while the root mean square speed, urms,is closer to 500 m/s.
The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass (m)and speed (u) is given by:
\\mathrm{KE} = \ mu^2
Expressing mass in kilograms and speed in metersper second will yield energy values in units of joules (J = kg m 2 s-2). To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages forboth speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT, the root mean square velocity of a particle,urms , is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of thevelocities with n = the number of particles:
u_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{\\overline{u^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{u^2_1 + u^2_2 + u^2_3 +u^2_4 + ...}{n}}
The average kinetic energy, KE avg , isthen equal to:
\\mathrm{KE}_\\mathrm{avg} = \ mu^2_\\mathrm{rms}
Where m is the mass of an individual molecule ofgas in kg. Assuming we are dealing with one mole of molecules of a gas we can derive thefollowing equation:
u_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\ RT}{M}}
Where M is the molar mass of the gas in units ofkg/mol.
The KEavg of a collection of gasmolecules is also directly proportional to the temperature of the gas and may bedescribed by the equation:
\\mathrm{KE}_\\mathrm{avg} = \ RT
where R is the gas constant and T is the kelvintemperature. (*Note that in this equation only temperature affects average kineticenergy. Any gas at the same temperature will have the same average kinetic energy.) Whenused in this equation, the appropriate form of the gas constant is 8.314 J/K mol (8.314kg m2 s-2 K-1 mol-1 ). These twoseparate equations for KE avg may be combined and rearranged to yield arelation between molecular speed and temperature:
\ mu^2_\\mathrm{rms} = \ RT
u_{rms}\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}M}
If the temperature of a gas increases, its KEavg increases, more molecules have higher speeds and fewer molecules havelower speeds, and the distribution shifts toward higher speeds overall, that is, to theright. If temperature decreases, KEavg decreases, more molecules have lowerspeeds and fewer molecules have higher speeds, and the distribution shifts toward lowerspeeds overall, that is, to the left. This behavior is illustrated for nitrogen gasbelow.
At a given temperature, all gases have the same KEavg for their molecules. Gases composed of lighter molecules have morehigh-speed particles and a higher urms , with a speed distribution thatpeaks at relatively higher velocities. Gases consisting of heavier molecules have morelow-speed particles, a lower urms , and a speed distribution that peaks atrelatively lower velocities.

49,1488,1488,76,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Mole Fraction and Molality,"Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were            introduced earlier, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications.            For example, molarity (M) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations,            since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species:
Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary.            When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of            solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the            contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many            colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent            on temperature. Two such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous unit on            gases) and molality.
The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the                    total number of moles of all solution components:
Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of                    solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms:
Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with            temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring            temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as            will be described in this module.
The antifreeze in most automobile radiators is a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene                glycol and water, with minor amounts of other additives that prevent corrosion. What                are the (a) mole fraction and (b) molality of ethylene glycol,                    C2H4(OH)2, in a solution prepared from 2.22                     103 g of ethylene glycol and 2.00  103 g of water                (approximately 2 L of glycol and 2 L of water)?
(a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar                amounts of both solution components and then substituting these amounts into the                unit definition.
Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties                with identical units (moles).
(b) To find molality, we need to know the moles of the solute and the mass of the                solvent (in kg).
First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of                solute:
Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms:
Finally, calculate molarity per its definition:
Calculate the mole fraction of solute and solvent in a 2.80 m solution of sodium                chloride.
Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing                the two unit definitions. In this case, both units have the same numerator (moles of                solute) but different denominators. The provided molal concentration may be written                as:
The numerator for this solutions mole fraction is, therefore, 2.80 mol NaCl. The                denominator may be computed by deriving the molar amount of water corresponding to                1.00 kg
and then substituting these molar amounts into the definition for mole fraction.
Note that the sum of the mole fraction of NaCl and the mole fraction of H2O is 1 (0.952 + 0.0480 = 1.000). This is true in general - the sum of the mole fractions of the solution components always equals 1.

50,614,614,43,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,International System of Units,"Measurements provide the macroscopic information that is the basis of most of the            hypotheses, theories, and laws that describe the behavior of matter and energy in both            the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three            kinds of information:
While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the            uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented            and will be discussed later. The number in the measurement can be represented in            different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation.
Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for            measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of            the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees            to be 1 liter. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life            threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patients seizures            and states a dosage of d without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing            to the medical professional giving the dose, but also the consequences can be dire: 100 mg            given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of            100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.
We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version            of the metric system, using the units listed in table below. Other units can be derived            from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international            agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the            French, Le Systme International dUnits). SI units have been used by the United States            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964.
Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream                    is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons                    (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but                    these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI                    units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a                    length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means                    cone thousand,d which in scientific notation is 103 (1 kilometer =                    1000 m = 103 m). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are                    raised are listed in table below.
The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI                    system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original                    standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and                    eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units                    commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent                    units.
The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the                    meter (m). A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from                    the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a                    vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer                    than a yard (Figure); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer                    distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 103 m),                    whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m =                        10-2 m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10-3 m).
The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). The kilogram was                    previously defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry                    (IUPAC) as the mass of a specific reference object. This object was originally                    one liter of pure water, and more recently it was a metal cylinder made from a                    platinum-iridium alloy with a height and diameter of 39 mm. In May                    2019, this definition was changed to one that is based instead on precisely                    measured values of several fundamental physical constants. One kilogram is                    about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass of the                    kilogram (10 kg).
Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin                    (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K                    (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word cdegreed nor the degree                    symbol (°). The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system,                    with both the word cdegreed and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements.                    Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales                    place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C) and                    boils at 373.15 K (100 °C) by definition, and normal human body temperature                    is approximately 310 K (37 °C). The conversion between these two units and                    the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this module.
The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be                    expressed with the appropriate prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003                    s = 3 × 10-6 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5 ×                        106 s. Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.

51,2038,2038,102,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Molarity,"Concentrations of solutions may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of            measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. Molarity (M)unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution is a useful            concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number            of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution.
unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution
A 355mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the                molar concentration of sucrose in the beverage?
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the                molarity can be calculated using the definition of molarity. Per this definition,                the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:
How much sugar (mol) is contained in 10 mL of the soda described in the example                above?
In this case, we can rearrange the definition of molarity to isolate the quantity                sought, moles of sugar. We then substitute the value for molarity that we derived in                the previous example, 0.375 M.
Distilled white vinegar is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H,                in water. A 0.500L vinegar solution contains 25.2 g of acetic acid. What is the                concentration of the acetic acid solution in units of molarity?
To calculate the molarity, you need mol of solute. Convert grams of acetic acid to                mol.
Substitute the values for mol and L into the definition of molarity.
How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30M solution?
The volume and molarity of the solution are specified. We can rearrange the                definition of molarity to isolate mole.
mol solute = M  L solution
Finally, this molar amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:
When performing calculations stepwise, it is important to refrain from rounding any            intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result.            In the previous example, the molar amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol,            would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be reported; however, although the            last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the            intermediate calculation. If we had not retained this guard digit, the final calculation            for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g.
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, we can also avoid            rounding errors by performing computations in a single step. This eliminates            intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.
In many situations you will be concerned with the molarity of a solution as                    described above. However, sometimes it may be useful to consider the                    concentration of individual ions in solution. Remember the equation for                    molarity:
When ionic compounds are dissolved in water they dissociate into their                    constituent ions. When sodium chloride, NaCl, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Na+ and one Cl ion per formula unit dissolved.                    However, when calcium chloride, CaCl2, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Ca2+ and two Cl ions per formula unit                    dissolved. This means that the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of Ca2+ ions when CaCl2 is                    dissolved in water. Likewise the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of the solution.
Animations developed from PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado                    Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu.
The solution of CaCl2 in the right animation has twice the                    concentration of Cl to Ca2+.
What is the concentration in molarity of a CaCl2 solution in which 4.85 g                of CaCl2 has been dissolved in water to form 850 mL of solution? What is                the concentration in molarity of the Ca2+ ions in the solution                and the Cl ions in the solution?
Calculating the molarity of the CaCl2 solution is the same process as we                have seen previously.
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
Since there is one Ca2+ ion produced per formula unit of                    CaCl2, the concentration of Ca2+ is also 0.0514                M.
Since there are two Cl ions produced per formula unit of                CaCl2, the concentration of Cl is:
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Ca2+ is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Cl is 0.103 M.

52,684,684,45,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,"The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are            empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The            mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases            at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships            that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these            relationships.
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively            explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is            based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term cmoleculed will            be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some            gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)
The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the            behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT,            which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately            represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws            (Boyles, Charless, Gay-Lussac\'s, Avogadros, and Daltons laws) conceptually to see            how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships            between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain            Grahams law.
Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends            directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we            see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas. In the following series of            activities use your knowledge of the gas laws to answer the following questions, thereby            making the connection as to how the KMT explains the observations that result in the gas            laws.

However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.
Based on the information in the massspectra for zirconium in the image above, we can determine that there are 5naturally occurring isotopes of zirconium, Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr, and Zreach with an approximate percent abundance as seen in the table below.

54,4785,4785,251,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Binary Ionic Compounds,"In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the            total number of negative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically            neutral overall, even though they contain positive and negative ions. We can use this            observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic            compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative            charges are equal.
A binary ionic compoundIonic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion. consists of a monatomic (formed from one atom) cation and a            monatomic anion. Note that the ending of the names of monatomic anions are changed to            -ide. For example, sulfide is an ion of sulfur and phosphide is an ion of            phosphorus.
Ionic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion.
Write the chemical formula for potassium sulfide.
Referring to the periodic table, we see that                        potassium will form a 1+ ion and sulfur will form a 2- ion, as illustrated                        in the diagrams below.
In order to obtain a                        neutral compound 2 potassium ions must combine with 1 sulfur ion.
A convenient method to write chemical formulas is by using the criss-cross                    method. In this method the value of the ionic charge for the cation becomes the                    subscript of the anion in the chemical formula and the value of the ionic charge                    of the anion becomes the subscript of the cation in the chemical formula.                    Looking at the previous example we can see how the criss-cross method works.
Like the previous method, the result is K2S. One thing to remember with the                    criss-cross method is that the ratio of ions in a chemical formula of an ionic                    compound must always be in the smallest whole number ratio.
Write the chemical formula for magnesium oxide.
Notice the result of the criss-cross method results in:
This 2:2 ratio of ions is reduced to 1:1, resulting in the formula:
Given the name of a binary ionic compound you can derive the formula and given                    the formula you can name the compound.
Name the compound Li3P.
In all of the examples we have looked at so far the cation in the formula can only                    form one ion. For example, when the calcium atom forms an ion, it is always                        Ca2+ or when potassium forms an ion it is always K+.                    However some of the transition metals can form different ions. For example lead                    can form ion Pb2+ and Pb4+. So when it combines with                    chlorine the result may be PbCl2 or PbCl4. When we write                    the name for each of these formulas we need to indicate whether the compound is                    formed from the Pb2+ and Pb4+ ion. We do this using roman                    numerals. Where the roman numeral indicates the charge of the ion in the                    formula.
Note that not all transition metals can form multiple cations. Here is a list of                    the most common.

Manganese(III)

Iron(III)
Fe3+
Cobalt(III)

Copper(II)

It is also worth noting that the following metals always form the same ion.                    Silver always forms Ag+. Cadmium always forms Cd2+. Zinc always forms Zn2+.                    Gallium always forms Ga3+. Aluminum always forms Al3+.

55,3540,3540,171,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Resonance,"Some molecules can have two possible structures with the atoms in the same positions and            have identical formal charges such as the nitrite ion seen below. The electrons involved            in the NO double bond, however, are in different positions:
If nitrite ions do indeed contain a single and a double bond, we would expect for the two            bond lengths to be different. A double bond between two atoms is shorter (and stronger)            than a single bond between the same two atoms. Experiments show, however, that both NO            bonds in NO2 have the same strength and length, and are identical            in all other properties.
It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for NO2 in            which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are equivalent. Instead, we use the concept            of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement of atoms can be            written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of            that shown by the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each            of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in NO2 is the average of a double            bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance formstwo or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons. The            actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is            called a resonance hybridaverage of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow            between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. Thus, the electronic            structure of the NO2 ion is shown as:
two or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons
average of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures
We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an            electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between            resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that            shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory,            used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and            resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described            it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with            both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a            resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros,            it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some            characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves            are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).
The carbonate anion, CO32, provides a second example of            resonance:
One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central            atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any            one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion.            Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual            arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures.            Again, experiments show that all three CO bonds are exactly the same.

56,824,824,52,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Introduction to Valence Bond Theory,"As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural            laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain            experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained            widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are            consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules.            However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.
There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use            quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are            likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p            orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free            atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe            the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete            understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the            electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms            when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the            nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are            described by valence bond theory and hybridization.
Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled                    atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of                    electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two                    different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second                    orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a                    covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom                    overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each                    orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this                    negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei                    serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent                    bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the                    orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are                    stronger than those that have less overlap.
The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. The slideshow                    below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored                    curve) changes as they approach each other.
The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the                    bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity                    of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of                    energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in the                    slideshow, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is 7.24  10 J lower in                    energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number.                    However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond                    energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24                     10 J to break one HH bond, but it takes 4.36  105 J to break 1 mole of                    HH bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in the table                    below. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table                    provides average values. For example, breaking the first CH bond in CH4, methane,                     requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first CH bond in H (toluene, a common                    paint thinner) requires 375.5 kJ/mol.

57,1257,1257,67,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Heating and Cooling Curves,"In the unit on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or            released by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature            change, \xceT, was introduced:
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,            but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a            temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat            is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of            increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a            change in state, its temperature remains constant.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply            heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the waters            temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant            despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is            maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to            provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the            boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase            transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state            is in progress.
The slide show below shows the change in temperature that occurs when a constant source            of heat is added to ice with an initial temperature of -10.0 oC. The resulting graph is            known as a heating curve.
How much heat is required to convert 135 g of ice at  C into water vapor at 120                C?
The transition described involves the following steps:
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in                phase) is: q = m  c  \xceT (see previous chapter on                thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given by q = n  \xceH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water,                and steam, and enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, we have:
Converting the quantities in J to kJ permits them to be summed, yielding the total                heat required:
The values below for water are used in the following example:
Calculate the heat required to convert 25.0 g solid ethanol at -135.0 oC                to liquid at 72.0 oC. Specific heat of solid ethanol = 0.97 J/g                    oC. Specific heat liquid ethanol 2.3 J/ g oC.
\xceHfus of ethanol = 4.9 kJ/mol
\xceHvap of ethanol = 38.56 kJ/mol

58,520,520,39,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Introduction to Aqueous Solutions,"In preceding sections, we focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter            that contain only one type of element or compound. However, mixturessamples of matter            containing two or more substances physically combinedare more commonly encountered in            nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition            of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount            of oxygen in a planets atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The            relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known            as an calloyd) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative            amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving            the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage            determines its sweetness. In this section, we will describe one of the most common ways            in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.
We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the                    composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout                    its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been                    implemented in many forms of man-made technology. Here we will introduce some of                    the basic properties of solutions.
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration.                    Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentrationquantitative measure of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present in a solution                    that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component                    is called the solventsolution component present in a concentration that is higher relative to other components and may be viewed as the medium in which the other                    components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent                    are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the                    solvent is called an aqueous solutionsolution for which water is the solvent. Water has the ability to dissolve many                    different types of substances. Because of this, it is often referred to as the                    universal solvent.

A solutesolution component present in a concentration less than that of the solvent is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower                    concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with                    qualitative terms such as dilutequalitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively low concentration (of relatively low concentration) and                    concentratedqualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively high concentration (of relatively high concentration).

59,3830,3830,192,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Module Summary and Quiz,"Matter has thermal energy due to the KE of its molecules and temperature that corresponds            to the average KE of its molecules. Heat is energy that is transferred between objects            at different temperatures; it flows from a high to a low temperature. Chemical and            physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI            unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).
Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the            temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a            substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature            change it undergoes.
Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or            physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that            occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured            quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the            process using known mathematical relations.
Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between the system being studied            and its surroundings. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by            introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the            energy content of food.

We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that containsthree pieces of information:
electronic structure of an atom in its ground state given as a listing ofthe orbitals occupied by the electrons
For example, the notation 2p4 (read ""twopfour"") indicates four electrons ina p subshelldumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describesorbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a pelectron (l = 1) with a principal quantum number (n) of 2. The notation 3d8(read ""threedeight"") indicates eight electrons in the d subshell (i.e., l = 2) of theprincipal shell for which n = 3.
dumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describesorbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a pelectron
To determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can cbuilddthe structures in the order of atomic numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, andcontinuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a timeto the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have describedthe electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principleprocedure in which the electron configuration of the elements isdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, addingone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the propersubshell at a time, from the German word Aufbau (cto build upd). Each added electronoccupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in thediagram below), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantumnumbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enterhigher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled tocapacity.
procedure in which the electron configuration of the elements isdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, addingone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the propersubshell at a time
Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electronconfigurations, the figure below provides an alternative method for determiningthe electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen andincludes each subshell as you proceed in increasing Z order. For example, afterfilling the 3p block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followedby the 3d orbitals.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the electron configurationof an element from the periodic table.
The alkali metal sodium (atomic number 11) has one more electron than the neonatom. This electron must go into the lowest-energy subshell available, the 3sorbital, giving a 1s22s22p63s1configuration. The electrons occupying the inner shell orbitals are called core electronselectron in an atom that occupies the orbitals of the innershells. Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electronconfigurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noblegas that matches the core electron configuration, and then writing the rest ofthe electron configuration that represents the outer-shell electrons. Theouter-shell electrons are very significant in that they contain the valence electronselectrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts of the atom. The valence electrons are those electrons in the outermostshell orbitals of the atom. It is these electrons that heavily contribute to anelement\'s properties and they are the electrons involved in chemical bonding.Valance electrons will be discussed in more detail later in this course. For oursodium example, the symbol [Ne] represents core electrons,(1s22s22p6) and our abbreviated orcondensed configuration is [Ne]3s1.

electrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts
Similarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as[He]2s1, where [He] represents the configuration of the heliumatom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writingthe configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurationsof lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which are in the alkali metal family, haveonly one electron in a valence s subshell outside a filled set of innershells.
Li: [He]2s1
Na: [Ne]3s1
The alkaline earth metal magnesium (atomic number 12), with its 12 electrons in a[Ne]3s2 configuration, is analogous to its family memberberyllium, [He]2s2. Both atoms have a filled s subshell outside theirfilled inner shells. Aluminum (atomic number 13), with 13 electrons and theelectron configuration [Ne]3s23p1, is analogous to itsfamily member boron, [He]2s22p1.
The electron configurations of silicon (14 electrons), phosphorus (15 electrons),sulfur (16 electrons), chlorine (17 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) areanalogous in the electron configurations of their outer shells to theircorresponding family members carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon,respectively, except that the principal quantum number of the outer shell of theheavier elements has increased by one to n = 3. Figure shows the lowest energy,or ground-state, electron configuration for these elements as well as that foratoms of each of the known elements.
When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metalpotassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to addelectrons to the 3d subshell. However, all available chemical and physicalevidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the nextelectron is not added to the 3d level but is, instead, added to the 4s level.The 3d orbital with no radial nodes and is higher in energy because it is lesspenetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s, which has threeradial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of[Ar]4s1. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valenceshell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s subshell andcalcium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s2. This gives calciuman outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium andmagnesium.
Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additionalelectrons are added successively to the 3d subshell. This subshell is filled toits capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for l = 2 [d orbitals], there arel + 1 = 5 values of ml, meaning that there are five d orbitals thathave a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4p subshell fills next. Note thatfor three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y)through silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 delectrons are successively added to the (n  1) shell next to the n shell tobring that (n  1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La)through lutetium (Lu) and actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr), 14 f electrons(l = 3, 2l + 1 = 7 mlvalues; thus, seven orbitals with a combinedcapacity of 14 electrons) are successively added to the (n  2) shell to bringthat shell from 18 electrons to a total of 32 electrons.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the abbreviated electronconfiguration from the periodic table.
Thus far, we have looked at electron configurations for ground state atoms.Electron configurations for excited atoms can also be represented. If theelectron configuration represents an excited atom, it will not follow thesequence we have looked at for ground state atoms.

61,4210,4210,211,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,X-Ray Crystallography,"The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of            atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by            the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of            travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier            whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are            electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between            neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few angstroms (1  = 1             10 m)).
When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a            crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When            scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo            interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a            decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining            waves maxima are separated as shown below.
Light waves occupying the same space                experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b)                intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and                minima.
When X-rays of a certain wavelength, \xce\xbb, are            scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, d, they may            undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by            the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength.            This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, \xce, is related to the            wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:
n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta
This relation is known as the Bragg equation in            honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. The            illustration below shows two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal            planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in            constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different            angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive            interference.
The diffraction of X-rays scattered by                the atoms within a crystal permits the determination of the distance between the                atoms. The top image depicts constructive interference between two scattered                waves and a resultant diffracted wave of high intensity. The bottom image                depicts destructive interference and a low intensity diffracted                wave.
An X-ray diffractometer, such as the one            illustrated below, may be used to measure the angles at which X-rays are diffracted when            interacting with a crystal as described earlier. From such measurements, the Bragg            equation may be used to compute distances between atoms as demonstrated in the following            example exercise.
(a) In a diffractometer, a beam of                X-rays strikes a crystalline material, producing (b) an X-ray diffraction                pattern that can be analyzed to determine the crystal structure.
In a diffractometer, X-rays with a wavelength                of 0.1315 nm were used to produce a diffraction pattern for copper. The first order                diffraction (n = 1) occurred at an angle \xce = 25.25. Determine the spacing between                the diffracting planes in copper.
The distance between the planes is found by                solving the Bragg equation, \\(n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta\\), for d.
This gives:

62,2454,2454,121,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Covalent Bond Formation,"In ionic compounds, electrons are transferred between atoms of different elements to form            ions. But this is not the only way that compounds can be formed. Atoms can also make            chemical bonds by sharing electrons  between each other. Such bonds are called            covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar            tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or            fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen            atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the            H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same            number of valence electrons as the noble gas He
Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic            compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is            weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have            much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent            compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are            typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good            conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble            in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity            in any state.
Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the            hydrogen molecule, H2, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen            atoms. The diagram illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we            have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the            red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms            approach each other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to            overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic            nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared            electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the            bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive            charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases.            The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is            achieved.
Similar to hydrogen, an oxygen atom will form a covalent bond with another oxygen                atom to form and oxygen molecule, O2. In this interactive you will                explore the energy associated with the formation of this bond.

1. Click on the radio button for two oxygen atoms.
2. Zoom out on the graph so that the full potential energy graph can be viewed. The                graph should look like the image below.
3. Drag the oxygen atom on the right to the right so that it lines up with the right                side of the graph.
4. When you let go of the oxygen atom you see that it very slowly begins to move                towards the stationary oxygen atom. Continue watching as the two oxygen atoms get                closer together.
5. Now drag the oxygen atom on the right that has formed the covalent bond with the                oxygen atom of the left further to the left. Observe the graph.
It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an            endothermic process), whereas forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic            process). In the case of H2, the covalent bond is very strong; a large amount            of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules            and cause the atoms to separate:
Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2            molecules forms from two moles of H atoms:
Repeat steps 1-4 above. Click on the oxygen atom. Drag the atom on the right to the                right and observe as the two atoms are drawn together to form a covalent bond and an                oxygen molecule.

63,1838,1838,92,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Gas Density and Molar Mass,"One important application of the ideal gas law is to determine its molar mass and thereby            assist in its identification using the measured density of the gas. Review the            interactive below to see the derivation of the formula used to calculate the molar mass            of a gas from its density.
Press ""NEXT"" to advance slide show.
The molar mass of a gas can be determined given its density, temperature, and pressure            with the following equation:
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
Where d = density, R = ideal gas law            constant, T = temperature, and P = pressure.
A gas was found to have a density of 0.0847 g/L at 17.0 C and a pressure of 760                torr. What is its molar mass? What is the gas?
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
As before when using the ideal gas law constant, we need to ensure that the units in                the constant match the units used for the other variables and as before when using                the ideal gas law equation temperature must be in K. First we will convert the                pressure to units of atm. You will recall that 760 torr = 1 atm.
\equire{cancel} \equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{(0.0847                    \\mathrm{g/}\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}})( 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(290                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}}
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = 2.02 \\mathrm{g/mol}
The gas is hydrogen, H2.
This equation can also be used to determine the density of a known gas at a given            temperature and pressure.
Calculate the density of chlorine gas (Cl2) at 22 oC and 735 torr.
We can use the molar mass of a gas equation,
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
rearranging it to solve for density.
\equire{mathrsfs} d = \\frac{\\mathscr{M}P}{RT}
Because we know the identity of the gas, we can easily calculate its molar mass and                substitute it and the other given values (making the necessary conversions) into the                equation.
\equire{cancel} d = \\frac{(70.90 \\mathrm{g/}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.967 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}})}{ (0.08206                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L} \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(295 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})} = 2.83                    \\mathrm{g/L}

64,2865,2865,135,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules,"Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these            interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange            information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or            feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between            chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to            classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module            will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions:            precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.
A precipitation reactionreaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more)            solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic            compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement,            double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and            are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in            animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and            specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical            analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric            methods for determining the composition of matter. Watch the video below to see an example of a precipitation reaction.
reaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is            quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a            substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively            large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution            conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with            relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that            readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is            provided later in this course. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids            formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that            have been observed for many ionic compounds. Note that these guidelines are not            comprehensive, they do not cover every possible combination of cations and anions. It is            a good idea to memorize these guidelines.
Determine the solubility of the following compounds:
a) AgNO3
b) BaSO4
c) CaCO3
a) Nitrates are always soluble.
b) While sulfate compounds are often soluble, exceptions include: Ag+,                    Hg22+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Sr2+,                    Ba2+
c) Carbonate compounds are insoluble unless combined with a cation that is always                soluble.
We use these solubility rules to predict whether or not a precipitation reaction will            occur between two ionic compounds. A vivid example of precipitation is observed when            solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of            solid lead(II) iodide:
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble            compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general            solubility of iodide salts.
The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:
Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artists pigment known            as iodine yellow. The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for            fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
In order to determine whether or not a precipitation reaction will occur one needs to            identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion            pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver            nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing Ag+,                NO3, Na+, and F ions. Aside from the            two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two            additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3            and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgF            is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation            reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
potassium sulfate and barium nitrate
K+, SO42, Ba2+,                        NO3
KNO3 and BaSO4
If any of the possible products are insoluble a precipitate will form.
This reaction will form a precipitate of BaSO4. Therefore, the net ionic                equation is:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
sodium carbonate and ammonium nitrate
Na+, CO32, NH4+,                        NO3
NaNO3 and (NH4)2CO3
If all possible products are soluble, no reaction occurs.
The ions present in the reactants will remain unchanged when these two aqueous                solutions are combined. No reaction will occur.

65,749,749,49,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Crystalline vs. Amorphous Solids,"When most liquids are cooled, they eventually freeze and form crystalline solids, solids            in which the atoms, ions, or molecules are arranged in a definite repeating pattern. It            is also possible for a liquid to freeze before its molecules become arranged in an            orderly pattern. The resulting materials are called amorphous solids or noncrystalline            solids (or, sometimes, glasses). The particles of such solids lack an ordered internal            structure and are randomly arranged.
Metals and ionic compounds typically form ordered, crystalline solids. Substances that            consist of large molecules, or a mixture of molecules whose movements are more            restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids            composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide (shown            below), can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions            under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the            crystalline state under appropriate conditions.

Formulas for the substances undergoing the change (reactants) and substances                    generated by the change (products) are separated by an arrow and preceded by                    integer coefficients indicating their relative numbers.

Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A                    large number of important reactions are included in three categories:                    precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation                    reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base                    reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants.

67,4219,4219,211,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,X-Ray Crystallography,"The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of            atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by            the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of            travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier            whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are            electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between            neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few angstroms (1  = 1             10 m)).
When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a            crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When            scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo            interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a            decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining            waves maxima are separated as shown below.
Light waves occupying the same space                experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b)                intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and                minima.
When X-rays of a certain wavelength, \xce\xbb, are            scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, d, they may            undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by            the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength.            This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, \xce, is related to the            wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:
n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta
This relation is known as the Bragg equation in            honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. The            illustration below shows two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal            planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in            constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different            angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive            interference.
The diffraction of X-rays scattered by                the atoms within a crystal permits the determination of the distance between the                atoms. The top image depicts constructive interference between two scattered                waves and a resultant diffracted wave of high intensity. The bottom image                depicts destructive interference and a low intensity diffracted                wave.
An X-ray diffractometer, such as the one            illustrated below, may be used to measure the angles at which X-rays are diffracted when            interacting with a crystal as described earlier. From such measurements, the Bragg            equation may be used to compute distances between atoms as demonstrated in the following            example exercise.
(a) In a diffractometer, a beam of                X-rays strikes a crystalline material, producing (b) an X-ray diffraction                pattern that can be analyzed to determine the crystal structure.
In a diffractometer, X-rays with a wavelength                of 0.1315 nm were used to produce a diffraction pattern for copper. The first order                diffraction (n = 1) occurred at an angle \xce = 25.25. Determine the spacing between                the diffracting planes in copper.
The distance between the planes is found by                solving the Bragg equation, \\(n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta\\), for d.
This gives:

68,4005,4005,199,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Exceptions to the Octet Rule,"While most central atoms of molecules and polyatomic ions have eight electrons, some have            central atoms that do not have an octet of electrons in their Lewis structures. These            molecules fall into three categories:
First we will consider hypervalent molecules. These are the most common of the exceptions            and will be important to understand for our discussion in the next module.
Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n =                    2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because                    they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three                        2p orbitals).
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 2nd period, C, N, O, and F do NOT exceed                    an octet.
Elements in the third and higher periods (n  3) have                    their valence electrons in the 3rd period or higher. These shells include a d                    subshell and allow atoms in the 3rd period or higher to accommodate more than an                    octet of electrons.
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 3rd period or higher, while they usually                    form an octet, can exceed an octet of electrons. Molecules formed from these                    elements are called hypervalent molecules. The Lewis structures below show two                    hypervalent molecules, SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, which is used as an                    insulating gas in the electrical industry, but is a potent greenhouse gas.
In some hypervalent molecules, such as XeF4, xenon tetrafluoride which                     was the first binary compound of a noble gas, some of the electrons in                    the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs:
When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have                    electrons left over after filling the valence shells of the outer atoms with                    eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central                    atom.
Determine the Lewis structure for phosphorus pentachloride,                        PCl5, which is an important chlorinating agent in organic and inorganic synthesis. .
As before, we need to calculate the number of valence electrons that will be                        represented in the Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central P atom to the terminal Cl atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The Lewis structure now shows all 40 valence electrons in the molecule and is                        therefore complete.
Determine the Lewis structure for iodine pentafluoride, IF5, a fluorinating agent.
Calculate the number of valence electrons that will be represented in the                        Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central I atom to the terminal F atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The structure with the octets of the terminal atoms complete shows 40                        electrons. There are still 2 electrons to incorporate into the structure.                        These additional electrons are added to the central atom.
Now the structure shows all 42 electrons. Note that no additional electrons                        can be added to the F atoms because F is in the 2nd period and cannot exceed                        an octet of electrons.
We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not                    have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms                    from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not                    form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium                    dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium                    and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is                    possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a                    fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental                    evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for BF single                    bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three BF single bonds and an                    electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with                    an electron deficient boron. However, the BF bonds are slightly shorter than                    what is actually expected for BF single bonds, indicating that some double bond                    character is found in the actual molecule.
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight                    electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with                        BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the                    boron atom:
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals.                            Nitric oxide, NO a biological signaling molecule, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is                            produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react                            at high temperatures. Odd electron molecules are very rare and cannot                            achieve full octets of electrons around atoms because of the odd number                            of electrons. The two possible Lewis structures for NO are seen                            below. Based on formal charge, the left structure is more plausible than the right structure.

70,4827,4827,255,Solutions,Solubility,Module Summary and Quiz,"A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that            is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component            and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components            typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form            endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and            solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable            change in energy.
Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may            be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,            acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their            constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is            facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar            water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are            strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are            weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when            dissolved in water.
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several            factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces            that may exist between the substances atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to            dissolve is quantified as a substances solubility, its maximum concentration in a            solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute            at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a            solutes concentration exceeds its solubilitya nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that            will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.            Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low            mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing            temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.            The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial            pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henrys            law.
Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the                    learning objectives for the Solubility module and use the                    My Response link below to ask any questions you might have about                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can                    be for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation                    and questions may also shape the discussions in class.
Your responses will not be graded, but will be available for your instructor.

71,2976,2976,141,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded                    Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram. These diagrams represent each                    orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an                    arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow                    to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate                    two electrons of opposite spin.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created                    orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets                    one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired                    electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap                    during the formation of the BeCl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a                    molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom                    in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in                        Zn(CH3)2, which contains a linear CZnC arrangement,                    and the carbon atom in CO2.
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron                    density consist of a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one                    unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2                    hybridization, the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three                    identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry.
Although quantum mechanics yields the cplumpd orbital lobes as depicted,                    sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor                    lobes, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use                    these cthinnerd representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily                    visualize.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests                        sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is                    trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen                    atoms. We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in                    an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH3 as shown in the                    orbital energy level diagram. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the                    boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron                    pairs with a hydrogen electron when BH bonds form.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit                        sp2 hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on                    the central atom, such as ClNO, or molecules with two single bonds and a double                    bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O.
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of                    bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four sp3 hybrid                    orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p                    orbitals that produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each of                    these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by                    four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane                    exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron                    distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in                    CH4. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed                    equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen                    electron when the CH bonds form.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps                    with one of the four sp3 orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma                    () bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent                    bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the                    methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of                    methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the                    corners of a tetrahedronthree hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. However, in                    ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an                        sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form a  bond between the                    two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps                    with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen  bonds. The                    structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane. The orientation                    of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other.                    Experimental evidence shows that rotation around  bonds occurs easily.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The                    nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by                    the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen                    atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5, but the                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3) and water (104.5) are slightly smaller.                    Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,                        PCl3, and NCl3.
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid                    orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six                    valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of                    the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not                    those in the first or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five PCl                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the PCl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and                    the chlorine atoms in ClF3 and in ClF4+. (The                    electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2                    hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of                    electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no                    lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s                    orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals form six equivalent                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a                    different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in                        PCl6, the iodine atom in the interhalogens                        IF6+, IF5, ICl4,                        IF4 and the xenon atom in XeF4.
Ammonium sulfate is important as a fertilizer. What is the hybridization of                        the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion, SO42?
The Lewis structure of sulfate shows there are four regions of electron                        density. The hybridization is sp3.

72,3366,3366,162,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,The Structures of Ionic Crystals,"Ionic crystals consist of two or more different            kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these ions into a            crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same            size.
Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and            their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction.            Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge            are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the            cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two            principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of            positive and negative ions in the compound.
In simple ionic structures, we usually find the            anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array.            (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions            larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when            compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy            one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of            the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane.            The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so            the hole is called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of            six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at the corners of            an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. The figure below illustrates both of            these types of holes.
Cations may occupy two types of holes                between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes.
Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and            anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or octahedral holes, as            illustrated in the figure below. Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and            larger cations occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the            octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open structure, such as a simple cubic            array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the            more open spacing.
A cations size and the shape of the                hole occupied by the compound are directly related.
There are two tetrahedral holes for each anion in            either an HCP or CCP array of anions. A compound that crystallizes in a closest-packed            array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes can have a maximum cation:anion            ratio of 2:1; all of the tetrahedral holes are filled at this ratio. Examples include            Li2O, Na2O, Li2S, and Na2S. Compounds            with a ratio of less than 2:1 may also crystallize in a closest-packed array of anions            with cations in the tetrahedral holes, if the ionic sizes fit. In these compounds,            however, some of the tetrahedral holes remain vacant.
The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either            an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1. Thus, compounds with cations in octahedral holes in a            closest-packed array of anions can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 1:1. In NiO,            MnS, NaCl, and KH, for example, all of the octahedral holes are filled. Ratios of less            than 1:1 are observed when some of the octahedral holes remain empty.
In a simple cubic array of anions, there is one            cubic hole that can be occupied by a cation for each anion in the array. In CsCl, and in            other compounds with the same structure, all of the cubic holes are occupied. Half of            the cubic holes are occupied in SrH2, UO2, SrCl2, and            CaF2.
Different types of ionic compounds often            crystallize in the same structure when the relative sizes of their ions and their            stoichiometries (the two principal features that determine structure) are similar. Many            ionic compounds crystallize with cubic unit cells, and we will use these compounds to            describe the general features of ionic structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of cations and            anions of similar size in a 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple cubic structure.            Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated below) is an example of this, with Cs+ and Cl            having radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions            forming a simple cubic unit cell, with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions            forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple cubic unit cells            formed by Cs+ ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cl ions.            Cesium ions and chloride ions touch along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One            cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry            required by the formula for cesium chloride. Note that there is no lattice point in the            center of the cell, and CsCl is not a BCC structure because a cesium ion is not            identical to a chloride ion.
Ionic compounds with similar-sized                cations and anions, such as CsCl, usually form a simple cubic structure. They                can be described by unit cells with either cations at the corners or anions at                the corners.
We have said that the location of lattice points is            arbitrary. This is illustrated by an alternate description of the CsCl structure in            which the lattice points are located in the centers of the cesium ions. In this            description, the cesium ions are located on the lattice points at the corners of the            cell, and the chloride ion is located at the center of the cell. The two unit cells are            different, but they describe identical structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio            of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically crystallizes with            an FCC unit cell, like that shown below. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this,            with Na+ and Cl having radii of 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively.            We can think of this as chloride ions forming an FCC cell, with sodium ions located in            the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell. The            sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains            four sodium ions and four chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the            formula, NaCl.
Ionic compounds with anions that are                much larger than cations, such as NaCl, usually form an FCC structure. They can                be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral                holes.
The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also            crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated below. This structure contains sulfide            ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is            identical to the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc            ion is only about 40% of the radius of a sulfide ion, so these small Zn2+            ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the            tetrahedral holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell,            giving the empirical formula ZnS.
ZnS, zinc sulfide (or zinc blende)                forms an FCC unit cell with sulfide ions at the lattice points and much smaller                zinc ions occupying half of the tetrahedral holes in the                structure.
A calcium fluoride unit cell, like that shown in            the following figure, is also an FCC unit cell, but in this case, the cations are            located on the lattice points; equivalent calcium ions are located on the lattice points            of an FCC lattice. All of the tetrahedral sites in the FCC array of calcium ions are            occupied by fluoride ions. There are four calcium ions and eight fluoride ions in a unit            cell, giving a calcium:fluorine ratio of 1:2, as required by the chemical formula,            CaF2. Close examination of the figure will reveal a simple cubic array of            fluoride ions with calcium ions in one half of the cubic holes. The structure cannot be            described in terms of a space lattice of points on the fluoride ions because the            fluoride ions do not all have identical environments. The orientation of the four            calcium ions about the fluoride ions differs.
Calcium fluoride, CaF2,                forms an FCC unit cell with calcium ions (green) at the lattice points and                fluoride ions (red) occupying all of the tetrahedral sites between                them.",,crystallizes,how do cations interact with the cations of anions?,1,0,0.0,136.04559326171875
73,4355,4355,215,Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Colloids,"Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly            basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from            wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain            carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or            sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic            acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic            acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and            contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35            unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the  CO2 unit (shown below).
Soaps contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon                end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end is a carboxylate group. The                length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from soap to soap.
Detergents (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar            hydrocarbon chains, such as C12H25, and an ionic group, such as a            sulfate, or a sulfonate (such            as the detergent shown below). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium compounds in            hard water; detergents form water-soluble productsa definite advantage for            detergents.
Detergents contain a nonpolar                hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a                sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from                detergent to detergent.
The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be            explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon            (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,            nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted            by water (polar), illustrated in the following figure. As a result, the soap or            detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the            water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar            and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a            hydrophobic (cwater-fearingd) part and a hydrophilic (cwater-lovingd) part. As a            consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily            washed away.
This diagrammatic cross section of an                emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent acts as an                emulsifier.
Dispersed colloidal particles are often            electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not            contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the            iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and            the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide            ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have            positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged            dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign.            This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each            other.
The charged nature of some colloidal particles may            be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For example, the particles            comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick            Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The            charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized            and deposited as dust, such as in the Cottrell precipitator shown below. This is one of            the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes.            The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and            flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air            filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.
In a Cottrell precipitator, positively                and negatively charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes,                where they are neutralized and deposited as dust.
Gelatin desserts, such as Jell-O, are a type of            colloid. Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates            as it cools, yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal            dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a solid phase. It appears that the fibers of the            dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled            with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium.
Gelatin desserts are colloids in which                an aqueous solution of sweeteners and flavors is dispersed throughout a medium                of solid proteins. (credit photo: modification of work by Steven                Depolo)

74,4482,4482,228,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Energy of Covalent Bonds,"Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the            strength of a covalent bond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy            necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of bonded atoms requires            energy. The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it.
The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is            called the bond energy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic            molecule, DXY, is defined as the standard enthalpy change for the            endothermic reaction:
For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent HH bond, DHH, is 436 kJ            per mole of HH bonds broken:
Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies            in such a molecule is equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction            that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example, the sum of the four CH bond            energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the            reaction:
The average CH bond energy, DCH, is             \\frac{1660\\;\\mathrm{kJ}}{4\\;\\mathrm{mols}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{bonds}}\\;=\\;415\\;{\extstyle\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{mol}}}            because there are            four moles of CH bonds broken per mole of the reaction. Although the four CH bonds are            equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break;            once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining bonds are            easier to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to            break any one bond.
The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the            bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases.            Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the            same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds            between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in the            table below, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds            appears in the table that follows. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the            bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, CF is 439            kJ/mol, CCl is 330 kJ/mol, and CBr is 275 kJ/mol.
We can use bond energies to calculate approximate enthalpy changes for reactions                    where enthalpies of formation are not available. Calculations of this type will                    also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic                    reaction (\xceH negative, heat produced) results when the                    bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants. An                    endothermic reaction (\xceH positive, heat absorbed)                    results when the bonds in the products are weaker than those in the                    reactants.
The enthalpy change, \xceH, for a chemical reaction is                    approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the                    reactants (energy cind, positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds                    are formed in the products (energy cout,d negative sign). This can be expressed                    mathematically in the following way:
In this expression, the symbol  means cthe sum ofd and D represents the bond                    energy in kilojoules per mole, which is always a positive number. The bond                    energy is obtained from a table, like the Bond Energies table above, and will depend on whether the                    particular bond is a single, double, or triple bond. Thus, in calculating                    enthalpies in this manner, it is important that we consider the bonding in all                    reactants and products. Because D values are typically averages for one type of                    bond in many different molecules, this calculation provides a rough estimate,                    not an exact value, for the enthalpy of reaction.
Using bond energies from the table above, calculate the enthalpy change of                        the following reaction:
or
To form two moles of HCl, one mole of HH bonds and one mole of ClCl bonds                        must be broken. The energy required to break these bonds is the sum of the                        bond energy of the HH bond (436 kJ/mol) and the ClCl bond (243 kJ/mol).                        During the reaction, two moles of HCl bonds are formed (bond energy = 432                        kJ/mol), releasing 2  432 kJ; or 864 kJ. Because the bonds in the products                        are stronger than those in the reactants, the reaction releases more energy                        than it consumes:
Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The                        high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon produces a mixture of the                        gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol                        can be produced. Using the bond energies in Table, calculate the approximate                        enthalpy change, \xceH, for the reaction here:
First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the                        products:
From this, we see that \xceH for this reaction involves                        the energy required to break a CO triple bond and two HH single bonds, as                        well as the energy produced by the formation of three CH single bonds, a                        CO single bond, and an OH single bond. We can express this as follows:
Using the bond energy values in the table above, we obtain:
In the following series of activities, we will calculate the change in                        enthalpy for the reaction below using bond energies.

75,307,307,27,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Changes in Enthalpy,"Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to            describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as            the sum of a systems internal energy (E) and the mathematical            product of its pressure (P) and volume (V):
Since it is derived from three state functions (E, P, and V), enthalpy is also a state            function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only            enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes            that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical            changes), the enthalpy change (\xceH) is:
The mathematical product P\xceV represents            work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By            their definitions, the arithmetic signs of \xceV and w will always be opposite:
Substituting this equation into the enthalpy-change equation yields:
From definition of internal energy, \xceE = q + w, we then get:
Where the subscript on heat, qp , is included to            specify that this is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
If a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the                  only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow                  (qp) and enthalpy change (\xceH) for the process are                      equal.
for processes occurring at constant pressure.
The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of            the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially            constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction            measured in a bomb calorimeter, as discussed previously, is not equal to \xceH because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents            expansion work from occurring. Chemists usually perform experiments under normal            atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure where q =                \xceH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for            determining heat.
The following shows how the above conventions apply when we use \xceH for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas: :
When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of                NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat is produced. What is \xceH for the following reaction, corresponding to the enthalpy                change per mole of acid reacting?
For the reaction of 0.0500 mol HCl acid, q = .9 kJ. This                leads us to the ratio                                                                        .9 kJ                            0.0500 mol HCl                                                            Which can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1                mole of HCl reacts:
The enthalpy change when 1 mole of HCl reacts is therefore  kJ. Since in the                chemical equation, one mole of HCl reacts, we write the enthalpy of the reaction as:
The following example illustrates that you need to take both stoichiometry and limiting            reactants into account when determining the \xceH for a chemical            reaction.
A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C12H22O11.                When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO3, 43.7 kJ of heat is                produced. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.
Moles of C12H22O11 available:
Moles of KClO3 available:
Since,
is needed, C12H22O11 is the excess reactant and                    KClO3 is the limiting reactant. Because all of the KClO3 reacts, we                can say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 7.19 g of KClO3 reacts. (Note that we                cannot say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 2.67 g of sucrose reaction, because                not all of the sucrose reacted in this experiment.)

76,766,766,50,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP),"The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most            fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely            regarded as the cfather of modern chemistry,d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, cIt took the mob only a moment            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.
As described in an earlier in this course, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for            answers to many of the questions that ask cHow much?d We can answer the question with            masses of substances or volumes of solutions. However, we can also answer this question            another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the            pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the            ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal            with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions            involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will            provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already            discussed.

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of                    molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and                    temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a standard temperature                        and pressure (STP)standard temperature                            and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm                    (101.325 kPa). At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 Lthis is                    referred to as the standard molar volumevolume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally.

volume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally
One mole of any gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 L.
*Note that this relationship ONLY applies when the gas is at STP.
We can calculate the molar volume of a gas by using the ideal gas law.
What is the volume of 1.00 mol of He at a pressure of 1.00 atm and 273.15                        K?
\equire{cancel} V = \\frac{(1.00 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(273.15 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1.00                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}} = 22.4 \\mathrm{L}
Recognize that the answer in the above example would have been the same                    regardless of the type of gas identified in the problem. 1 mole of ANY gas at                    STP has a volume of This provides a simple conversion factor to use in                    situations when gases are at STP.
A 4.9 g sample of methane, CH4, gas is at standard temperature and                        pressure. What volume does the sample occupy?
Notice here that the amount of gas is given in grams. We will need to convert                        from grams to moles and then use the relationship between moles and volume                        of gas at STP to convert to volume.

The molar volume of a gas can also be applied to more complex stoichiometry                    problems involving reactions. We can add volume of gases to our stoichiometry                    flowchart that we saw earlier.
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas. Zinc reacts with                        hydrochloric acid according to the reactions below.
5.8 g of zinc is reacted with an excess amount hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen                        gas produced is collected at STP. What is the volume of the hydrogen                        gas?
We will use the following steps to solve this problem according to our                        flowchart above:

77,2593,2593,125,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,The Nuclear Atom,"The next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a            physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and            England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively            charged alpha particlespositively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons (\xce particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of            radium; \xce particles consist of two protons and two neutrons. Rutherford and his            colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a            beam of \xce particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of            the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering            of the \xce particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an \xce            particle.
positively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons
What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being            deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were            deflected almost straight back toward the source.
Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving \xce particles passed            through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty            space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when            they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like            charges repel one another, the few positively charged \xce particles that changed paths            abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly            concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the            time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing            a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:
This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very            small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is            concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the atom is            electrically neutral. He named this fundamental particle the protonPositively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom., the positively            charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will            learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used            today.
Positively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom.
The image in the activity below represents a close-up diagram of Rutherford\'s gold                foil experiment. Drag the description of the observation that Rutherford made to the                place on the diagram that represents that observation.
One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom,            with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different            proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the            existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged            particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found            evidence of neutronsuncharged, subatomic particle located in the nucleus, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same            as that of protons.

78,2376,2376,116,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,BCC and FCC Unit Cells,"Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of            unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells: simple cubic (which we have            already seen), body-centered cubic unit cell, and face-centered cubic unit cellall of which are            illustrated in the figure below. (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems,            some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit            cells. We leave the more complicated geometries for later in this module.)
Cubic unit cells of metals show (in the upper                figures) the locations of lattice points and (in the lower figures) metal atoms located in the                unit cell.
Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a            cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the center, as shown in the            figure below. This is called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corners of a BCC            unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains            two atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom from            the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom in this structure touches four atoms in the            layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC structure has a            coordination number of eight.
In a body-centered cubic structure, atoms in a                specific layer do not touch each other. Each atom touches four atoms in the layer above it and                four atoms in the layer below it.
Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently            packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68% of the total volume. Isomorphous            metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature. (Elements or            compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous.)
Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead,            crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and at            the centers of each face, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called a            face-centered cubic (FCC) solid. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at            each of the eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom            on each of the six faces (\\(6\imes\\\;=3\\) atoms from the faces). The atoms at the corners            touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of the cube.            Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.
A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the                corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the faces of its unit cells.
Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely            together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume. This structure is also called cubic            closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms.            Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer            below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination            number of 12. The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately            obvious, but why they are actually the same structure is illustrated below.
A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating                layers (ABCABC) of hexagonally arranged atoms. Atoms in a CCP structure have a coordination                number of 12 because they contact six atoms in their layer, plus three atoms in the layer above                and three atoms in the layer below. By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP                structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from                layer B across a diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from                layer C at the remaining corner. This is the same as a face-centered cubic                arrangement.
Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions            between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in            this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP,            which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in the following            figure. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second            layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact            with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP,            atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is            also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers            (i.e., ABABABb\xaf). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two            layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type            B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABCb\xaf). About twothirds of all metals crystallize            in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of 12. Metals that crystallize in an HCP            structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a CCP structure            include Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt.
In both types of closest packing, atoms are                packed as compactly as possible. Hexagonal closest packing consists of two alternating layers                (ABABAB). Cubic closest packing consists of three alternating layers                (ABCABCABC).
Calcium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure.                The edge length of its unit cell is 558.8 pm.
(a) What is the atomic radius of Ca in this structure?
(b) Calculate the density of Ca.
(a) In an FCC structure, Ca atoms contact each other                across the diagonal of the face, so the length of the diagonal is equal to four Ca atomic radii                (d = 4r).
Two adjacent edges and the diagonal of the face form a                right triangle, with the length of each side equal to 558.8 pm and the length of the hypotenuse                equal to four Ca atomic radii:
\\mathrm a^2+\\mathrm a^2=\\mathrm                d^2\\longrightarrow{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2+{(558.5\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2=(4\\mathrm r)^2\\;
Solving this gives for a Ca radius.
r\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2\\;+\\;{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2\\;}{16}}=197.6\\;\\mathrm{pm}
(b) Density is given by \\(                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) . The density of calcium can be found by determining the                density of its unit cell: for example, the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the                volume of the unit cell. A face-centered Ca unit cell has one-eighth of an atom at each of the                eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces                \\(6\imes\\\;=3\\) atoms), for a total of four atoms in the unit cell.
The mass of the unit cell can be found by:

The volume of a Ca unit cell can be found by:
V\\;=\\;a^3\\;=\\;\\left(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm}\imes\\frac{10^{-10}\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{pm}}\ight)^3\\;=\\;1.745\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3
(Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm                to get the usual volume units for density.)
Then, the density of Ca is:
\\mathrm{density}\\;=\\;\\frac{2.662\\;\imes\\;10^{-22}\\;\\mathrm                g}{1.745\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3}\\;=\\;1.53\\;\\mathrm g/\\mathrm{cm}^3\\;
In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of            three axes (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between them, as illustrated below. The            axes are defined as being the lengths between points in the space lattice. Consequently, unit            cell axes join points with identical environments.
A cube is shown where each corner has a black dot drawn            on it. A circle in the bottom of the cube is composed of three double-ended arrows. The left top            of this circle is labeled calpha,d the top right is labeled cbetad and the bottom is labeled            cgamma.d The bottom left corner of the cube is labeled cad while the bottom of the back face is            labeled cbd and the top, back, left corner is labeled cc.d
A unit cell is defined by the lengths of its three axes            (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between the axes. There are seven different lattice            systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of fourteen different unit            cells, which have the shapes shown below.

79,2677,2677,128,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Introduction to the Periodic Table,"As early chemists worked to purify ores and discovered more elements, they realized that            various elements could be grouped together by their similar chemical behaviors. One such            grouping includes:
These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar            chemical properties.
A second grouping includes:
which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical            properties in common.
However, the specific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each            other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li,            Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen            atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen            atom.
Other elements that exhibit similar properties to each other are:
but the properties of this group of elements are drastically different from those of any            of the groups of elements above.
Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently            recognized that there was a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements            known at that time. Both published tables with the elements arranged according to            increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his            table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to            aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and            germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleevs work. Although Mendeleev and            Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleevs contributions to the development of            the periodic table are now more widely recognized.
By the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved            atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the            periodic law, is as follows: the properties of the elements are periodic functions of            their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the elements in increasing order            of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical            column. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called periods or series,            and 18 vertical columns, called groups. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In            the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However,            IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more            common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14            columns, are usually written below the main body of the table.
You will be using the periodic table frequently throughout this course. For your                    convenience a link to the periodic table will be at the beginning of every                    module, starting with the next one. The periodic table from this link will open                    in a separate tab. It may be a good idea to open it at the beginning of the                    module, as you will likely need it throughout any given module. All calculations                    within this course that use atomic masses as they appear on this periodic table, most of which are rounded                    to the hundredths place. There are many sources of periodic tables online or you                    may want to have a paper copy with which to work. Use whatever works best for                    you.
Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some            elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are            malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires),            and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or            ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into            large classes with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good            conductors of heat and electricityshaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull,            poor conductors of heat and electricityshaded green); and metalloids (elements that            conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and            some properties of nonmetalsshaded purple).
The elements can also be classified into the main-group elements (or representative            elements) in the columns labeled 1, 2, and 13; the transition metals in the columns            labeled 3; and inner transition metals in the two rows at the bottom of the table            (the top-row elements are called lanthanides and the bottom-row elements are actinides.            The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the            composition of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first            column) form compounds that consist of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen.            These elements (except hydrogen) are known as alkali metals, and they all have similar            chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds            consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called            alkaline earth metals, with similar properties among members of that group. Other groups            with specific names are the pnictogens (group 15), chalcogens (group 16), halogens            (group 17), and the noble gases (group 18, also known as inert gases). The groups can            also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can            be called the oxygen group or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element            with properties similar to both group 1 and group 17 elements. For that reason, hydrogen            may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.

80,4506,4506,229,Gases,Gas Laws,The Ideal Gas Law,"To this point, four separate laws have beendiscussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of thegas:
Combining these four laws yields the ideal gaslaw.
The ideal gas lawrelation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws shows the relation between the pressure, volume, temperature,and number of moles of a gas:
relation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles ofthe gas, T is its temperature on the kelvin scale, andR is a constant called the ideal gas constant or theuniversal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, andtemperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required bydimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atmmol  K  and 8.314 kPa L mol  K .
Gases whose properties of P , V , and T are accuratelydescribed by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit idealbehavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypotheticalconstruct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explainthe gas laws as will be described later in this unit. Although all the calculationspresented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable forgases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the finalmodule of this unit, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for thenon-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and lowtemperatures.
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, theideal gas constantconstant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K, R , and the variable properties P , V , n , andT . Specifying any four of these terms will permit use ofthe ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following examples.
constant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K
If the number of moles of an ideal gas are kept constant under two different setsof conditions, a useful mathematical relationship called the combined gas law isobtained:
using units of atm, L, and K. Both sets of conditions are equal to the productof n  R (where n = the number of moles of the gas and R is the idealgas law constant).
When filled with air, a typical scuba tank witha volume of 13.2 L has a pressure of 153 atm. If the water temperature is 27 C, howmany liters of air will such a tank provide to a divers lungs at a depth ofapproximately 70 feet in the ocean where the pressure is 3.13 atm?
Letting 1 represent the air in the scuba tankand 2 represent the air in the lungs, and noting that body temperature (thetemperature the air will be in the lungs) is 37 C, we can identify thevariables as:

81,2103,2103,105,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure,"The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and            the molecular structures:
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for CO2.
We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:
This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atomeach double                bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using                VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves                on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180. The electron-pair                geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are                linear.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for BCl3.
We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:
Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of                electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives                a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The BCl bonds lie in a plane with 120                angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular structure.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a water molecule.
The Lewis structure of H2O indicates that there are four regions of high                electron density around the oxygen atom: two lone pairs and two chemical bonds:
We predict that these four regions are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion. Thus, the                electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular structure is bent with an                angle slightly less than 109.5. In fact, the bond angle is 104.5.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of SF4.
The Lewis structure of SF4 indicates five regions of electron density                around the sulfur atom: one lone pair and four bonding pairs:
We predict that these five regions of electron density are arranged to give a                trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry. The one lone-pair on the sulfur will                occupy a position in the equitorial plane, giving a seesaw molecular geometry.
When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular                    structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do                    not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms                    that each possess a clocald geometry. The way these local structures are                    oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but                    such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory                    discussion. For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local                    structures.
The Lewis structure for the simplest amino acid, glycine,                            H2NCH2CO2H, is shown here. Predict the                        local geometry for the nitrogen atom, the two carbon atoms, and the oxygen                        atom with a hydrogen atom attached:
Consider each central atom independently.

We can use the wedge and dash notation when drawing the Lewis structure to                        better represent the local shapes within the molecule.

82,670,670,45,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,"The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are            empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The            mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases            at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships            that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these            relationships.
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively            explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is            based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term cmoleculed will            be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some            gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)
The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the            behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT,            which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately            represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws            (Boyles, Charless, Gay-Lussac\'s, Avogadros, and Daltons laws) conceptually to see            how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships            between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain            Grahams law.
Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends            directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we            see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas. In the following series of            activities use your knowledge of the gas laws to answer the following questions, thereby            making the connection as to how the KMT explains the observations that result in the gas            laws.

83,3955,3955,197,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Determination of Empirical Formulas,"As previously mentioned, the most common approachto determining a compounds chemical formula is to first measure the masses of itsconstituent elements. However, we must keep in mind that chemical formulas represent therelative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentallyderived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms inthe compound. To accomplish this, we can use molar masses to convert the mass of eachelement to a number of moles. We then consider the moles of each element relative toeach other, converting these numbers into a whole-number ratio that can be used toderive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determinedto contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H. The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles)are:
Thus, we can accurately represent this compoundwith the formula C 0.142 H 0.248 . Of course, per acceptedconvention, formulas contain whole-number subscripts, which can be achieved by dividingeach mol amount by the smaller of the two.
This gives us the whole number ratio of C:Hatoms in the compound as 1:2 or CH2
The empirical formula for this compound is thus CH2. This may or not be the compounds molecular formula as well; however,we would need additional information to make that determination (as discussed later inthis section).
The process for determining the formula for anempirical formula are summarized in the steps below.
Convert the given amount of eachelement into moles.
Divide each mole amount by thesmallest of the mole values.
If step 2 does not produce wholenumbers (or very close to it), find a multiple of all of the values thatproduces all whole numbers.
Write the chemical formula basedon the whole number ratio of atoms in the compound.
Consider as another example a sample ofcompound determined to contain 5.31 g Cl and 8.40 g O. What isthe empirical formula for this compound?
Convert to moles.
Divide each mole value by the smallest of thevalues.
Notice this step of the process inthis example did not yield a whole number ratio.
Find a multiple of the values that yields awhole number ratio.
Multiplying both mole values by 2 yields thewhole number ratio 2:7.
Write the chemical formula.
Finally, with regard to deriving empiricalformulas, consider instances in which a compounds percent composition isavailable rather than the absolute masses of the compounds constituentelements. In such cases, the percent composition can be used to calculate themasses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these masses canthen be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.
The bacterial fermentation of grain to produceethanol forms a gas with a percent composition of 27.29% C and 72.71% O. What is theempirical formula for this gas?
Since the scale for percentages is 100, it ismost convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100g. The calculation is cmost convenientd because, per the definition for percentcomposition, the mass of a given element in grams is numerically equivalent to theelements mass percentage. This numerical equivalence results from the definition ofthe cpercentaged unit, whose name is derived from the Latin phrase per centummeaning cby the hundred.d Considering this definition, the mass percentages providedmay be more conveniently expressed as fractions:
The molar amounts of carbon and hydrogen in ag sample are calculated by dividing each elements mass by its molar mass:
Coefficients for the tentative empiricalformula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of the two:
Since the resulting ratio is one carbon to twooxygen atoms, the empirical formula is:

84,3205,3205,154,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Units of Solution Concentration: Mass and Volume Percentage,"In the previous section, we introduced molarity, a very useful measurement unit for            evaluating the concentration of solutions. However, molarity is only one measure of            concentration. In this section, we will introduce some other units of concentration that            are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention.
Earlier, we introduced percent composition as a measure of the relative amount of                    a given element in a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the                    composition of mixtures, including solutions. The mass percentageratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage                       of a solution                    component is defined as the ratio of the components mass to the solutions                    mass, expressed as a percentage.
ratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage
We are generally most interested in the mass percentages of solutes, but it is                    also possible to compute the mass percentage of solvent.
Mass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass,                    percent weight, weight/weight percent, and other variations on this theme. The                    most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the percent sign, %, although                    more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use                    of these more detailed symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with                    other types of percentages, such as volume percentages (to be discussed later in                    this section).
Mass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label                    of a typical liquid bleach bottle cites the concentration of its active                    ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being 7.4%. A 100.0g sample of                    bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.
A 5.0g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What                        is the percent by mass of glucose in spinal fluid?
Substituting the given masses into the equation defining mass percentage                        yields:
Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg,                        g, kg, oz, and so on), the same unit must be used for both the solute and                        the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio.                        In this case, we converted the units of solute in the numerator from mg to g                        to match the units in the denominator. We could just as easily have                        converted the denominator from g to mg instead. As long as identical mass                        units are used for both solute and solution, the computed mass percentage                        will be correct.
cConcentratedd hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is                        commonly used as a laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19                        g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution?
In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage,                        we need to know the corresponding mass of the solution. Using the solution                        density given, we can convert the solutions volume to mass, and then use                        the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical                        approach is outlined in this flowchart:
For proper unit cancellation, the 0.500 L volume is converted into 500 mL,                        and the mass percentage is expressed as a ratio, 37.2g HCl/g solution:
Liquid volumes over a wide range of magnitudes are conveniently measured                            using common and relatively inexpensive laboratory equipment. The                            concentration of a solution formed by dissolving a liquid solute in a                            liquid solvent is therefore often expressed as a volume percentageratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage, %vol                            or (v/v)%.

Rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) is usually sold as a 70% vol aqueous                                solution. If the density of isopropyl alcohol is 0.785 g/mL, how                                many grams of isopropyl alcohol are present in a 355 mL bottle of                                rubbing alcohol?
Per the definition of volume percentage, the isopropanol volume is                                70% of the total solution volume. Multiplying the isopropanol volume                                by its density yields the requested mass:

One type of work (w) is the process of causing matter            to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle            tirewe move matter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already            in the tire.

Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two            types: (i)                potential energy                                                            energy of a particle or system of particles derived from relative                            position, composition, or condition                                                , the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or            condition, and (ii)                kinetic energy                                                            energy of a moving body, in joules, equal to 1/2 mv2 (where                                m = mass and v =                            velocity)                                                , the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of            a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward            through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce            electricity in a hydroelectric plant. A battery has potential energy because the            chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.

Kinetic energy is dependent on an object\'s mass and velocity according to the                    following equation:
Where m is mass in kg and v is                    velocity in m/s. If mass,  m is in kg and velocity, v, is in m/s, then the kinetic energy has units of                    Joules (J = kg m2/s2).
Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before            a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This            observation is expressed in the                 law of conservation of energy                                                            during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor                            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.                                                : during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.

Return to the simulation.
Check to see if your calculations match the approximate values given for PE and KE in                the bar graph of the simulation.
As you are likely aware the assumption in the previous exercise, that no energy was lost            to friction, is not what occurs in the real world. As well as having kinetic and            potential energy, energy is being transferred from the skateboard to the surface of the            track in the form of thermal energy caused by the interaction between the wheels of the            skateboard and the surface of the track. Return to the skatepark simulation and choose            the ""Friction"" screen. Again click to show the bar graph. Drag the skater to the top of            the track and observe the changes in energy now that the thermal energy due to friction            is accounted for.
When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of            one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the            conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example,            chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose            gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a cars engine, the rapidly            expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type            of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders pistons.
For chemical reactions, mass and energy are conserved separately. The total mass present            before the reaction occurs is equal to the total mass present after the reaction occurs.            Likewise, the total energy present before the reaction occurs is equal to the total            energy present after the reaction occurs. However, for nuclear reactions, mass can be            converted into energy according to Einsteins formula (E = mc2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light). In nuclear reactions, the total mass            changes and this leads to changes in energy that are much larger (by factors of a            million or so) than chemical reactions. To encompass both chemical and nuclear changes,            we combine these laws into one statement: The total quantity of matter and energy in the            universe is fixed. For most of this course, we will considering only chemical reactions,            and so energy and mass are separately conserved.
The animations and activities that follow show how energy is transformed from one type to            another in certain processes.

86,4605,4605,233,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Diagrams,"Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showingthe individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a singlehydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. We wouldexpect to find the electron in the 1s orbital. By convention, the ms = +1/2value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagramare:
Following hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2. The heliumatom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same fourquantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (n = 1, l = 0, ml = 0,ms = +1/2). The second electron also goes into the 1s orbital and fillsthat orbital. The second electron has the same n, l, and ml quantum numbers,but must have the opposite spin quantum number, ms = /2. This is in accordwith the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the sameset of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box(representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in oppositedirections (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagramof helium are:
The n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom.
The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first twoelectrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbersas the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of nextlowest energy, the 2s orbital. Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram oflithium are:
An atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4, contains fourprotons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus. The fourth electronfills the remaining space in the 2s orbital.
An atom of boron (atomic number 5) contains five electrons. The n = 1 shell is filledwith two electrons and three electrons will occupy the n = 2 shell. Because any ssubshell can contain only two electrons, the fifth electron must occupy the next energylevel, which will be a 2p orbital. There are three 2p orbitals of equal energy (ml= ,, +1) and the electron can occupy any one of these p orbitals. When drawing orbitaldiagrams, we include empty boxes to depict any empty orbitals in the same subshell thatwe are filling.
Carbon (atomic number 6) has six electrons. Four of them fill the 1s and 2s orbitals. Theremaining two electrons occupy the 2p subshell. We now have a choice of filling one ofthe 2p orbitals and pairing the electrons or of leaving the electrons unpaired in twodifferent p orbitals. The orbitals are filled as described by Hunds rulethe lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.: thelowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of orbitals of equalenergy is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the two electronsin the carbon 2p orbitals have identical n, l, and ms quantum numbers anddiffer in their ml quantum number (in accord with the Pauli exclusionprinciple). The electron configuration and orbital diagram for carbon are:
the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.
Nitrogen (atomic number 7) fills the 1s and 2s subshells and has one electron in each ofthe three 2p orbitals, in accordance with Hunds rule. These three electrons haveunpaired spins. Oxygen (atomic number 8) has a pair of electrons in any one of the 2porbitals (the electrons have opposite spins) and a single electron in each of the othertwo. Fluorine (atomic number 9) has only one 2p orbital containing an unpaired electron.All of the electrons in the noble gas neon (atomic number 10) are paired, and all of theorbitals in the n = 1 and the n = 2 shells are filled. The electron configurations andorbital diagrams of these four elements are:
Note that you can also use the abbreviated electron configurations when writing theorbital diagrams.

However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.

88,1788,1788,89,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Standard Enthalpy of Formation,"Standard enthalpies of formation provide a convenient means to calculate the enthalpy of            reactions. A standard enthalpy of formation,                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                , of a pure substance is the enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1            mole of that substance is formed from the elements in their most stable states under            standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or            predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to            carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have            values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the            enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hesss            law.
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is .5 kJ/mol. This is the            enthalpy change for the reaction that forms CO2(g) from the elements:
The reactants are the elements in their cstandard statesd, which is the most stable form            of the element at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 C. For the element carbon, the standard            state is graphite, because this is the most stable form of carbon under at 1 atm and 25            C. For oxygen, the standard state is O2(g). The product of the formation            reaction is one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 C. For nitrogen dioxide,                NO2(g),                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                                     is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
A reaction equation with 1/2 mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is            correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole            of product, NO2(g).
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in            this  Table of Thermodynamic Properties. These values indicate that            formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as  kJ/mol for the formation            of P4O10) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the            formation of acetylene, C2H2). Note that the standard enthalpy of            formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero.
Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic                process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction                in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the                reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation,                                                                \xce                                                    H                            f                            o                                                                                     of ozone from the following information:

89,1373,1373,71,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions,"Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated                    that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same                    proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions(also, law of constant composition) all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass                    or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of                    the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent                    with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a                    component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system)                    are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1,                    as shown in table below.
(also, law of constant composition) all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass
It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the                    same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have                    the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there                    are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass                    ratio of 5.33:1.00.
Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments,                    to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportionswhen two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers states                    that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one                    element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole                    numbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid                    with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown                    crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These                    ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative;                    however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly                    surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.
when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers

This 2-to-1 ratio means that the brown compound has twice the amount of chlorine                    per amount of copper as the green compound.
This can be explained by atomic theory if the copper-to-chlorine ratio in the                    brown compound is 1 copper atom to 2 chlorine atoms, and the ratio in the green                    compound is 1 copper atom to 1 chlorine atom. The ratio of chlorine atoms (and                    thus the ratio of their masses) is therefore 2 to 1.
A sample of compound X (a clear, colorless, combustible liquid with a                        noticeable odor) is analyzed and found to contain 14.13 g carbon and 2.96 g                        hydrogen. A sample of compound Y (a clear, colorless, combustible liquid                        with a noticeable odor that is slightly different from Xs odor) is analyzed                        and found to contain 19.91 g carbon and 3.34 g hydrogen. Are these data an                        example of the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple proportions,                        or neither? What do these data tell you about substances X and Y?
In compound X, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
In compound Y, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
The ratio of these ratios is:
This small, whole-number ratio supports the law of multiple proportions. This means that X and Y are different compounds.

90,4826,4826,255,Solutions,Solubility,Module Summary and Quiz,"A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that            is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component            and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components            typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form            endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and            solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable            change in energy.
Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may            be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,            acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their            constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is            facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar            water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are            strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are            weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when            dissolved in water.
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several            factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces            that may exist between the substances atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to            dissolve is quantified as a substances solubility, its maximum concentration in a            solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute            at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a            solutes concentration exceeds its solubilitya nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that            will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.            Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low            mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing            temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.            The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial            pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henrys            law.

91,1765,1765,88,Solutions,Solubility,Electrolytes,"As discussed in an earlier unit, when some substances are dissolved in water they yield            ions in solution. These substances constitute an important class of compounds called            electrolytes. Substances that do not yield ions when dissolved are called            nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is            essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the            substance is known as a strong electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the            dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a weak            electrolyte.
Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the            electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct            electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is            the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged            entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved            ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to            electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of            dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or            qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit .
Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions. The electrostatic                    attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole                    attraction. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic                    compounds in water.
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and                    disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and                    solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This                    process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most                    conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,                    and so they are classified as strong electrolytes.
Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to                    water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water                    molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they                    attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water                    molecules penetrate between individual K+ and Cl ions and                    surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together                    and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as seen in the                    illustration below. The reduction of the electrostatic attraction permits the                    independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution, resulting in an                    increase in the disorder of the system as the ions change from their fixed and                    ordered positions in the crystal to mobile and much more disordered states in                    solution. This increased disorder is responsible for the dissolution of many                    ionic compounds, including KCl, which dissolve with absorption of heat.
In other cases, the electrostatic attractions between the ions in a crystal are                    so large, or the ion-dipole attractive forces between the ions and water                    molecules are so weak, that the increase in disorder cannot compensate for the                    energy required to separate the ions, and the crystal is insoluble. Such is the                    case for compounds such as calcium carbonate (limestone), calcium phosphate (the                    inorganic component of bone), and iron oxide (rust).
Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very                    slightly ionizedonly about two out of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25                    C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton (H+                    ion) to another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions.
In some cases, we find that solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct                    electricity because the solute molecules react chemically with the solvent to                    produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of                    covalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, when we dissolve                    hydrogen chloride in water, we find that the solution is a very good conductor.                    The water molecules play an essential part in forming ions: Solutions of                    hydrogen chloride in many other solvents, such as benzene, do not conduct                    electricity and do not contain ions.
Hydrogen chloride is an acid, and so its molecules react with water, transferring                    H+ ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) and chloride ions (Cl):
This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a strong acid                    and, consequently, a strong electrolyte). Likewise, weak acids and bases that                    only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when                    dissolved in water and are classified as weak electrolytes.

92,4433,4433,226,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Multi-step Conversions,"Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex            problems involving computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the            sameall the factors involved in the calculation must be appropriately oriented to            insure that their labels (units) will appropriately cancel and/or combine to yield the            desired unit in the result. This is why it is referred to as the factor-label method. As            your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this            approach.
Let\'s look at a couple of examples that are a bit more complex
Amanda is 64 inches tall. What is her height in meters?
Notice that on our list of conversion factors there is no direct conversion from                inches to meters. We will take a two-step approach first converting in. to cm and                then cm to m.
One method of using dimensional analysis is to enter the units for the conversion                first and then add in the values. This activity will take you through this                approach.
Your gas tank has a volume of 17.5 gal. What is this measurement in mL?
Since we do not have a direct conversion factor from gal to mL we will go through the                following steps to make this conversion.
Convert 22,500 inches to kilometers. Round your final answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Based on conversion factors that we know we will take the following steps to make this                conversion:
Based on these steps, fill in the conversion factors below.
Let\'s say you want to convert from m to ft. You know that 1 m = 3.2808 ft.                    However, this is a unit of length and not a unit of area so we cannot use this                    conversion factor as is.
If we look at the square above that measures 1 meter by 1 meter, to find the area                    we multiply length times width.
Making conversions involving cubed units of volume is similar. Let\'s say you                    want to convert from in3 to cm3. You know that 1 in. = 2.54 cm. However, this is                    a unit of length not volume so this unit cannot be used directly.
If we look at the cube above that measures 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch, to find                    the volume we multiply length times width times height.
Your friend that lives in Spain tells you that his new apartment is                            55m2. You want to convert the value to ft2 because                        that is the unit of area that you are most familiar with. You know that 1 m                        = 3.2808 ft.
Your friend\'s apartment is 590 square feet.
The volume of a swimming pool is 375,000 dm3. Convert this volume                        to m3.
You know that 1 m = 10 dm. Therefore 1 m3 = (10                        dm)3.

93,1339,1339,69,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,Introduction to Chemistry,"Chemistry is sometimes referred to as cthe central scienced due to its                    interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for                    areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).                    Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine,                    materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields.                  The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many                    aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines                    within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry.                    Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools                    that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the                    chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial                    to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living                    organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and                    nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce                    useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture,                    food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide                    sustenance in the form of food and drink to the worlds population. Medicine,                    pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that                    help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and                    atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand                    and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the                    universe in astronomy and cosmology.
What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and                    assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing,                    containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and                    other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you                    will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and                    structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their                    causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws                    involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the                    study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice                    of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens                    whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead                    to such changes.
Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and their changes. Chemists study and                    describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains:                    macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of                    considering and describing chemical behavior.
Macro is a Greek word that means clarge.d The macroscopic domain is familiar to                    us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed                    directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat                    and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday                    and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical                    properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability.
The microscopic domain of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination.                    Micro also comes from Greek and means csmall.d Some aspects of the microscopic                    domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite                    or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye,                    but when were suffering from a cold, were reminded of how real they are.
However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistrysuch as                    atoms and moleculesare too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and                    often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain                    include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of                    which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms                    in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual                    molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules                    into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms                    together are created.
The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent                    components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as                    those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are                    part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider                    calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important                    role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic                    domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the                    challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols                    can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and                    one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that                    must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.
A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous                    substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze                    to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher                    temperatures are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall                    into the microscopic domainwhat we cannot observe with the naked eye. The                    description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and                    the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these                    molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe                    water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the                    symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for gas, (s) for solid, and (l) for                    liquid are also symbolic.

94,4566,4566,232,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Determination of Molecular Formulas,"Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a            compounds elements. Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single            molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its            molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by            various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the            mass spectrum of the compound. Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental            methods, many of which will be introduced in later in this course.
Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compounds molecular or molar mass to its            empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of            the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula.
The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the                    empirical formula by n, as shown by the generic empirical formula                        AxBy:
For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be                CH2O. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30            amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one O            atom). If the compounds molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this indicates that            molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the            empirical formula:
Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts            are six times greater than those in the empirical formula:
Note that this same approach may be used when the molar mass (g/mol) instead of the            molecular mass (amu) is used. In this case, we are merely considering one mole of            empirical formula units and molecules, as opposed to single units and molecules.
Nicotine, an alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants that is mainly responsible                for the addictive nature of cigarettes, contains 74.02% C, 8.710% H, and 17.27% N.                If 40.57 g of nicotine contains 0.2500 mol nicotine, what is the molecular                formula?
Determining the molecular formula from the provided data will require comparison of                the compounds empirical formula mass to its molar mass. As the first step, use the                percent composition to derive the compounds empirical formula. Assuming a                convenient, a 100-g sample of nicotine yields the following molar amounts of its                elements:
Next, we calculate the molar ratios of these elements relative to the least abundant                element, N.
The C-to-N and H-to-N molar ratios are adequately close to whole numbers, and so the                empirical formula is C5H7N. The empirical formula mass for                this compound is therefore 81.13 amu/formula unit, or 81.13 g/mol formula unit.
We calculate the molar mass for nicotine from the given mass and molar amount of                compound:
Comparing the molar mass and empirical formula mass indicates that each nicotine                molecule contains two formula units:
Thus, we can derive the molecular formula for nicotine from the empirical formula by                multiplying each subscript by two:

95,484,484,37,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Pressure,"The earths atmosphere exerts a pressure, as doesany other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric pressure, we are sensitiveto pressure changesfor example, when your ears cpopd during take-off and landing whileflying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gasmolecules colliding with the surfaces of objects. Although the force of each collisionis very small, any surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisionsin a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air pressure isstrong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from insidethe container.
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of thecolumn of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object, such as the tanker car. Atsea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown Africanelephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. Ifyou actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twicethe usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.
In general, pressure is defined as theforce exerted on a given area: P=FA. Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inverselyproportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing theamount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure canbe decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area.
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal(Pa), with 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 , where N is the newton, a unit of forcedefined as 1 kg m/s2. One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases,it is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) or bar (1 bar= 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds offorce on an area of one square inchpounds per square inch (psi)for example, incar tires. Pressure can also be measured using the unit atmosphere (atm), whichoriginally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximatelatitude of Paris (45).
The most commonly used units in this courseare kPa, atm, and mmHg or torr. The unit of mmHg refers to pressure measured ina barometer, which we will discuss shortly. At standard atmospheric pressure or atm the height of a column of mercury in a barometer is 760 mm. A torr is aunit that can be used interchangeably with mmHg, named after EvangelistaTorricelli, inventor of the barometer.
The US Weather Service reports airpressure in inches of mercury. If the pressure is reported on a particularday as 29.5 in. Hg, what is the pressure in units of atm? (1 inch = 2.54cm)
Here we will use a multi-stepdimensional analysis to make the conversion.

96,2960,2960,141,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded                    Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram. These diagrams represent each                    orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an                    arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow                    to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate                    two electrons of opposite spin.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created                    orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets                    one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired                    electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap                    during the formation of the BeCl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a                    molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom                    in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in                        Zn(CH3)2, which contains a linear CZnC arrangement,                    and the carbon atom in CO2.
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron                    density consist of a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one                    unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2                    hybridization, the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three                    identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry.
Although quantum mechanics yields the cplumpd orbital lobes as depicted,                    sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor                    lobes, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use                    these cthinnerd representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily                    visualize.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests                        sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is                    trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen                    atoms. We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in                    an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH3 as shown in the                    orbital energy level diagram. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the                    boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron                    pairs with a hydrogen electron when BH bonds form.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit                        sp2 hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on                    the central atom, such as ClNO, or molecules with two single bonds and a double                    bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O.
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of                    bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four sp3 hybrid                    orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p                    orbitals that produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each of                    these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by                    four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane                    exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron                    distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in                    CH4. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed                    equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen                    electron when the CH bonds form.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps                    with one of the four sp3 orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma                    () bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent                    bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the                    methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of                    methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the                    corners of a tetrahedronthree hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. However, in                    ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an                        sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form a  bond between the                    two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps                    with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen  bonds. The                    structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane. The orientation                    of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other.                    Experimental evidence shows that rotation around  bonds occurs easily.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The                    nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by                    the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen                    atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5, but the                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3) and water (104.5) are slightly smaller.                    Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,                        PCl3, and NCl3.
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid                    orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six                    valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of                    the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not                    those in the first or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five PCl                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the PCl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and                    the chlorine atoms in ClF3 and in ClF4+. (The                    electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2                    hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of                    electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no                    lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s                    orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals form six equivalent                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a                    different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in                        PCl6, the iodine atom in the interhalogens                        IF6+, IF5, ICl4,                        IF4 and the xenon atom in XeF4.
Ammonium sulfate is important as a fertilizer. What is the hybridization of                        the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion, SO42?
The Lewis structure of sulfate shows there are four regions of electron                        density. The hybridization is sp3.

97,590,590,43,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,International System of Units,"Measurements provide the macroscopic information that is the basis of most of the            hypotheses, theories, and laws that describe the behavior of matter and energy in both            the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three            kinds of information:
While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the            uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented            and will be discussed later. The number in the measurement can be represented in            different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation.
Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for            measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of            the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees            to be 1 liter. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life            threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patients seizures            and states a dosage of d without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing            to the medical professional giving the dose, but also the consequences can be dire: 100 mg            given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of            100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.
We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version            of the metric system, using the units listed in table below. Other units can be derived            from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international            agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the            French, Le Systme International dUnits). SI units have been used by the United States            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964.
Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream                    is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons                    (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but                    these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI                    units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a                    length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means                    cone thousand,d which in scientific notation is 103 (1 kilometer =                    1000 m = 103 m). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are                    raised are listed in table below.
The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI                    system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original                    standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and                    eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units                    commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent                    units.
The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the                    meter (m). A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from                    the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a                    vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer                    than a yard (Figure); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer                    distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 103 m),                    whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m =                        10-2 m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10-3 m).
The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). The kilogram was                    previously defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry                    (IUPAC) as the mass of a specific reference object. This object was originally                    one liter of pure water, and more recently it was a metal cylinder made from a                    platinum-iridium alloy with a height and diameter of 39 mm. In May                    2019, this definition was changed to one that is based instead on precisely                    measured values of several fundamental physical constants. One kilogram is                    about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass of the                    kilogram (10 kg).
Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin                    (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K                    (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word cdegreed nor the degree                    symbol (°). The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system,                    with both the word cdegreed and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements.                    Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales                    place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C) and                    boils at 373.15 K (100 °C) by definition, and normal human body temperature                    is approximately 310 K (37 °C). The conversion between these two units and                    the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this module.
The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be                    expressed with the appropriate prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003                    s = 3 × 10-6 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5 ×                        106 s. Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.

When electrons are transferred between atoms and ions            form, ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is,            the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this            case, cations and anions).
electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound
When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an            element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of            electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is            stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite            charge present in the compound.
For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one            electron to form a sodium cation, Na+, and each chlorine atom in a sample of            chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, Cl,            the resulting compound, NaCl, is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio            of one Na+ ion for each Cl ion. Similarly, each calcium atom            (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to            form CaCl2, which is composed of Ca2+ and Cl ions in            the ratio of one Ca2+ ion to two Cl ions.

A compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic            compoundCompound held together by ionic bonds.. The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic:            When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This            guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds            typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always            true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic).
Compound held together by ionic bonds.
You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are            solids that typically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures.            For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and boils at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the            molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C and AlCl3 melts at 180 °C.) In solid form, an ionic            compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow            (celectricityd is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct            electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid.

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the            atoms.

Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular            formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine                (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent            distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the            element titanium.
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the            molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
If we know a compounds formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives            vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.
