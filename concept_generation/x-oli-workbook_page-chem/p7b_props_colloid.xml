Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain\n            carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or\n            sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic\n            acid are formed.

The hydrocarbon\n            (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,\n            nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted\n            by water (polar), illustrated in the following figure. As a result, the soap or\n            detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the\n            water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar\n            and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a\n            hydrophobic (\xe2\x80\x9cwater-fearing\xe2\x80\x9d) part and a hydrophilic (\xe2\x80\x9cwater-loving\xe2\x80\x9d) part. As a\n            consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily\n            washed away. </p>\n        <image id="e7ee824462f34707bbfad272489d2283" src="../webcontent/U9M3_micelle.jpg"\n            alt="This figure shows a drop of oil in which approximately thirty hydrocarbon tails are oriented toward the center of the drop with ionic ends indicated as tiny red spheres on the surface of the oil drop.

A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not\n            contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the\n            iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and\n            the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide\n            ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have\n            positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged\n            dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign.\n            This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each\n            other. </p>\n        <p id="df6b0c1532174cf491071008d484e2a2">The charged nature of some colloidal particles may\n            be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For example, the particles\n            comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick\n            Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The\n            charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized\n            and deposited as dust, such as in the Cottrell precipitator shown below. This is one of\n            the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes.\n            The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and\n            flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air\n            filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.</p>\n        <image id="c474052456774a3296562d3401f0d683" src="../webcontent/U9M3_Electrical.jpg"\n            alt="This figure shows a diagram of a Cottrell precipitator.
