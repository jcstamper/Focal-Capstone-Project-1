A <extra><anchor>physical property</anchor><meaning><material><p>A characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition.</p></material></meaning></extra> is a characteristic of matter that \n                    is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples \n                    of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling \n                    points, and electrical conductivity. We can observe some physical properties, \n                    such as density and color, without changing the physical state of the matter \n                    observed. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron \n                    or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes \n                    a physical change. A <extra><anchor>physical change</anchor><meaning><material><p>A change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition.</p></material></meaning></extra> is a change in the state or properties \n                    of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition (the \n                    identities of the substances contained in the matter). We observe a physical \n                    change when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses \n                    into liquid water. Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and \n                    demagnetizing metals (as is done with common anti-theft security tags) and \n                    grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes \n                    in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, \n                    form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/physical_change.jpg" width="600" alt="Figure A is a photograph of 5 brightly burning candles.

Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity,\n                    acidity, reactivity (many types), and heat of combustion. Iron, for example, combines \n                    with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize. \n                    Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no \n                    hazard because it is very unreactive.  </p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/chemical_properties.jpg" width="600" alt="Figure A is a photo of metal machinery that is now mostly covered with reddish orange rust.

A <extra><anchor>chemical change</anchor><meaning><material><p>A change in matter that always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change.</p></material></meaning></extra> always \n                    produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change. \n                    The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than \n                    the iron, oxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin \n                    is a chemical change because the gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the \n                    original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions that are performed \n                    in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and \n                    food being cooked, digested, or rotting.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/chemical_change.jpg" width="600" alt="Figure A is a photo of the flask containing a blue liquid.

(b) During the combustion of a match, cellulose in the match and \n                        oxygen from the air undergo a chemical change to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. (c) \n                        Cooking red meat causes a number of chemical changes, including the oxidation of iron in \n                        myoglobin that results in the familiar red-to-brown color change. (d) A banana turning \n                        brown is a chemical change as new, darker (and less tasty) substances form.
