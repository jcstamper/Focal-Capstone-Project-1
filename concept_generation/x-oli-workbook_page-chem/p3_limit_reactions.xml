All the exercises of the\n            preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, when\n            calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was\n            assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or\n            greater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants\n            are not present in stoichiometric amounts.</p>\n\n        <p>Consider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches:</p>\n\n        <formula>1 slice of cheese + 2 slices of bread \\(\\rightarrow\\) 1 sandwich</formula>\n\n        <p>Stoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese\n            slices in a 2:1 ratio. Provided with 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese, one may\n            prepare 11 sandwiches per the provided recipe, using all the provided cheese and having\n            six slices of bread left over. In this scenario, the number of sandwiches prepared has\n            been limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been provided in\n            excess.</p>\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/bread.png" width="650"\n            alt="This figure has three rows showing the ingredients needed to make a sandwich. The first row reads, \xe2\x80\x9c1 sandwich = 2 slices of bread + 1 slice of cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d Two slices of bread and one slice of cheese are shown. The second row reads, \xe2\x80\x9cProvided with: 28 slices of bread + 11 slices of cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d There are 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese shown. The third row reads, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can make: 11 sandwiches + 6 slices of bread left over.\xe2\x80\x9d 11 sandwiches are shown with six extra slices of bread.">\n            <caption>Sandwich making can illustrate the concepts of limiting and excess\n                reactants.</caption>\n        </image>\n\n        <p> Consider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen\n            with chlorine to yield hydrogen chloride:</p>\n        <formula>$${\\mathrm\n            H}_2(g)\\;+\\;{\\mathrm{Cl}}_2(g)\\;\\longrightarrow\\;2\\;\\mathrm{HCl}(g)$$</formula>\n\n\n\n        <p>The balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric\n            ratio. If these reactants are provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will\n            nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting the amount of product that may be\n            generated. This substance is the <extra><anchor>limiting reactant</anchor><meaning><material><p>reactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated</p></material></meaning></extra>, and the other substance is the\n            <extra><anchor>excess reactant</anchor><meaning><material><p>reactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry</p></material></meaning></extra>. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation\n            requires computing the molar amounts of each reactant provided and comparing them to the\n            stoichiometric amounts represented in the balanced chemical equation. For example,\n            imagine combining 3 moles of H<sub>2</sub> and 2 moles of Cl<sub>2</sub>.\n            This represents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction,\n            which is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Hydrogen, therefore, is present\n            in excess, and chlorine is the limiting reactant. Reaction of all the provided chlorine\n            (2 mol) will consume 2 mol of the 3 mol of hydrogen provided, leaving 1 mol of hydrogen\n            unreacted.</p>\n\n        <p>An alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the\n            amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant\n            amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per\n            the reaction\xe2\x80\x99s stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the\n            limiting reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the\n            hydrogen would yield</p>\n        <formula>$$\\require{cancel}\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{HCl}\\;\\mathrm{produced}\\;=\\;3\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm\n            H}_2}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{2\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{HCl}}{1\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm\n            H}_2}}\\;\\;=\\;6\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{HCl}$$</formula>\n\n\n\n        <p>Complete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce </p>\n        <formula>$$\\require{cancel}\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{HCl}\\;\\mathrm{produced}\\;=\\;2\\cancel{\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm{Cl}}_2}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{2\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{HCl}}{1\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}\\;{\\mathrm{Cl}}_2}}\\;\\;=\\;4\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{HCl}$$</formula>\n\n\n        <p>The chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced.\n            Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl, there will be unreacted\n            hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting\n            reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant.</p>\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/before_after.png" alt="The figure shows a space-filling molecular models reacting.
