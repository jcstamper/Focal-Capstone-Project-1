The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may\n                    be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of\n                    these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron\n                    shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily\n                    determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to\n                    fill their valence shells.</p>\n                <p> Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by\n                    the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared\n                    equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one\n                    atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The\n                    ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called\n                    its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms\n                    determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical\n                    atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or\n                    pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the\n                    case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic. </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Ionic and Covalent Bonding</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
