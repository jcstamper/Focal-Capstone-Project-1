For example, 1 mole of any\n            nonelectrolyte dissolved in 1 kilogram of solvent produces the same lowering of the\n            freezing point as does 1 mole of any other nonelectrolyte. However, 1 mole of sodium\n            chloride (an electrolyte) forms 2 moles of ions when dissolved in solution. Each\n            individual ion produces the same effect on the freezing point as a single molecule\n            does.</p>\n        <example>\n            <p>The concentration of ions in seawater is approximately the same as that in a solution\n                containing 4.2 g of NaCl dissolved in 125 g of water. Assume that each of the ions\n                in the NaCl solution has the same effect on the freezing point of water as a\n                nonelectrolyte molecule, and determine the freezing temperature the solution (which\n                is approximately equal to the freezing temperature of seawater).</p>\n            <p>Convert from grams to moles of NaCl using the molar mass of NaCl in the unit\n                conversion factor.</p>\n            <formula>$$\\require{cancel}4.2\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm\n                g\\;\\mathrm{NaCl}}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{NaCl}}{58.44\\cancel{\\;\\mathrm\n                g\\;\\mathrm{NaCl}}}\\;=\\;0.0719\\;\\mathrm{mol}$$</formula>\n            <p>Determine the number of moles of ions present in the solution using the number of\n                moles of ions in 1 mole of NaCl as the conversion factor (2 mol ions/1 mol\n                NaCl).</p>\n            <formula>$$\\require{cancel}\\;0.0719\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{NaCl}}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{2\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{ions}}{1\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{NaCl}}}\\;=\\;0.143\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{ions}$$</formula>\n            <p>Determine the molality of the ions in the solution from the number of moles of ions\n                and the mass of solvent, in kilograms.</p>\n            <formula>$$m\\;=\\;\\frac{\\;0.143\\;\\mathrm{mol}}{0.125\\;\\mathrm{kg}}\\;=\\;1.14\\;m$$</formula>\n            <p>Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal\n                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.</p>\n            <formula>$$\\triangle T_\\mathrm f\\;=\\;K_\\mathrm fm\\;=\\;(1.86\\;^\\circ\\mathrm\n                Cm^{-1})(1.14\\;m)\\;=\\;2.1\\;^\\circ\\mathrm C$$</formula>\n            <p>Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the\n                change.</p>\n            <formula>$$\\mathrm{freezing}\\;\\mathrm{point}\\;=\\;0.0\\;^\\circ\\mathrm\n                C\\;-\\;2.1\\;^\\circ\\mathrm C\\;=\\;-2.1\\;^\\circ\\mathrm C$$</formula>\n        </example>\n        <p>Assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0 m aqueous solution of NaCl contains 2.0 mole of\n            ions (1.0 mol Na<sup>+</sup> and 1.0 mol Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup>) per each kilogram of water, and\n            its freezing point depression is expected to be</p>\n        <formula>$$\\triangle T_\\mathrm\n            f\\;=\\;2.0\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{ions}/\\mathrm{kg}\\;\\mathrm{water}\\;\\times\\;1.86\\;^\\circ\\mathrm\n            C\\;\\mathrm{kg}\\;\\mathrm{water}/\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{ion}\\;=\\;3.7\\;^\\circ\\mathrm\n            C$$</formula>\n        <p>When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured,\n            however, a value of 3.4 \xc2\xb0C is obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other\n            ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured and expected colligative\n            property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase.\n            These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong\n            electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in solution.</p>\n        <p>To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total\n            dissociation, an experimentally measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning\n            German chemist Jacobus Henricus van\xe2\x80\x99t Hoff is used. The van\xe2\x80\x99t Hoff factor (i) is defined\n            as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units\n            dissolved:</p>\n        <formula>$$i\\;=\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{moles}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{particles}\\;\\mathrm{in}\\;\\mathrm{solution}}{\\mathrm{moles}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{formula}\\;\\mathrm{units}\\;\\operatorname{dissolved}}$$</formula>\n        <p>Values for measured van\xe2\x80\x99t Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values\n            assuming complete dissociation, are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n        <table>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Electrolyte</th>\n                <th>Particles in Solution</th>\n                <th><em style="italic">i</em> (Predicted)</th>\n                <th><em style="italic">i</em> (Measured)</th>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>HCl</td>\n                <td>H<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup></td>\n                <td>2</td>\n                <td>1.9</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>NaCl</td>\n                <td>Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup></td>\n                <td>2</td>\n                <td>1.9</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>MgSO4</td>\n                <td>Mg<sup>2+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\xe2\x88\x92</sup>\n                </td>\n                <td>2</td>\n                <td>1.3</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>MgCl2</td>\n                <td>Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 2 Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup></td>\n                <td>3</td>\n                <td>2.7</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>FeCl3</td>\n                <td>Fe<sup>3+</sup>, 3 Cl<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup></td>\n                <td>4</td>\n                <td>3.4</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>glucose</td>\n                <td>C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub></td>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>1.0</td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich H\xc3\xbcckel proposed a theory to explain the\n            apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although\n            interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the\n            ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The\n            residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles.\n          In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a\n            solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of\n            any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions\n            become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual\n            interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the\n            effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the\n            actual concentrations. Note that the van\xe2\x80\x99t Hoff factors for the electrolytes in the table above\n            are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of <em style="italic">i</em> for NaCl is 1.9, as\n            opposed to an ideal value of 2.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_04_ionpair.jpg" alt="The diagram shows four purple spheres labeled K superscript plus and four green spheres labeled C l superscript minus dispersed in H subscript 2 O as shown by clusters of single red spheres with two white spheres attached.
