Water\n                (H<sub>2</sub>O, molecular mass 18 amu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower\n            molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to\n            dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and\n            larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion\n            forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to\n            differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit\n            comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a\n            particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a\n            hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most\n            electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H\n            atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or\n            3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively\n            small sizes of F, O, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these\n            atoms. Molecules with F-H, O-H, or N-H moieties are very strongly attracted to similar\n            moieties in nearby molecules, a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole attraction\n            called hydrogen bonding. Examples of hydrogen bonds include HF\xe2\x8b\xafHF, H<sub>2</sub>O\xe2\x8b\xafHOH,\n            and H<sub>3</sub>N\xe2\x8b\xafHNH<sub>2</sub>, in which the hydrogen bonds are denoted by dots.\n            The video below illustrates hydrogen bonding between water molecules.</p>\n        <video width="600" height="400" src="../webcontent/hydrogen_bond_full.mp4"></video>\n        <image src="../webcontent/HBonding.jpg" alt="Five water molecules are shown near one another, but not touching.

Hydrogen bonds\n            are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about 5 to 10% as strong, but are generally\n            much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.</p>\n        <p>Hydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids\n            and solids). For example, consider the trends in boiling points for the binary hydrides\n            of group 15 (NH<sub>3</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub>, AsH<sub>3</sub>, and SbH<sub>3</sub>),\n            group 16 hydrides (H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>Se, and\n            H<sub>2</sub>Te), and group 17 hydrides (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI), as discussed in the\n            slide show below.</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Slide Show: Boiling Points of Hydrides</title>\n            <body>\n                <p><em style="italic">Click "NEXT" to progress the slide show.</em></p>\n                <wb:inline idref="boiling_pt_hydride_ss"></wb:inline>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n      <!--  <iframe src="https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/239481" width="800" height="469"/>-->\n\n\n        <!--  The boiling points of\n            the heaviest three hydrides for each group are plotted in Figure. As we progress down\n            any of these groups, the polarities of the molecules decrease slightly, whereas the\n            sizes of the molecules increase substantially. The effect of increasingly stronger\n            dispersion forces dominates that of increasingly weaker dipole-dipole attractions, and\n            the boiling points are observed to increase steadily.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/graph_hbond.jpg" width="500">\n            <caption>For the group 15, 16, and 17 hydrides, the boiling points for each class of\n                compounds increase with increasing molecular mass for elements in periods 3, 4, and\n                5.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>If we use this trend to predict the boiling points for the lightest hydride for each\n            group, we would expect NH<sub>3</sub> to boil at about \xe2\x88\x92120 \xc2\xb0C, H<sub>2</sub>O to boil\n            at about \xe2\x88\x9280 \xc2\xb0C, and HF to boil at about \xe2\x88\x92110 \xc2\xb0C. However, when we measure the boiling\n            points for these compounds, we find that they are dramatically higher than the trends\n            would predict, as shown in Figure. The stark contrast between our na\xc3\xafve predictions and\n            reality provides compelling evidence for the strength of hydrogen bonding.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/graph_hbond2.jpg" width="500">\n            <caption>In comparison to periods 3\xe2\x88\x925, the binary hydrides of period 2 elements in\n                groups 17, 16 and 15 (F, O and N, respectively) exhibit anomalously high boiling\n                points due to hydrogen bonding.</caption>\n        </image>-->\n        <example>\n            <p>Consider the compounds dimethylether (CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>), ethanol\n                    (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH), and propane\n                    (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>). Their boiling points, not\n                necessarily in order, are \xe2\x88\x9242.1 \xc2\xb0C, \xe2\x88\x9224.8 \xc2\xb0C, and 78.4 \xc2\xb0C.

Since CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> is\n                nonpolar, it may exhibit only dispersion forces. Because\n                    CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub> is polar, it will also experience dipole-dipole\n                attractions. Finally, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH has an \xe2\x88\x92OH group, and so it\n                will experience the uniquely strong dipole-dipole attraction known as hydrogen\n                bonding.
