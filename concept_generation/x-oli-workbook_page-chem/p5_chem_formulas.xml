(A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type\n            is present.)

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C\n            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines\n            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between\n            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss\n            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For\n            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a\n            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with\n            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the\n            atoms.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/methane_models.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="Figure A shows C H subscript 4. Figure B shows a carbon atom that is bonded to four hydrogen atoms at right angles: one above, one to the left, one to the right, and one below. Figure C shows a 3-D, ball-and-stick model of the carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Figure D shows a space-filling model of a carbon atom with hydrogen atoms partially embedded into the surface of the carbon atom.">\n            <caption>A methane molecule can be represented as (a) a molecular formula, (b) a\n                structural formula, (c) a ball-and-stick model, and (d) a space-filling model.\n                Carbon and hydrogen atoms are represented by black and white spheres, respectively.\n            </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules\n            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,\n            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules\n            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular\n            formulas H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Other elements\n            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>), chlorine\n                (Cl<sub>2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub>2</sub>), and iodine (I<sub>2</sub>). The most\n            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms\n            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S<sub>8</sub>.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/sulfur_models.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="Figure A shows eight sulfur atoms, symbolized with the letter S, that are bonded to each other to form an octagon. Figure B shows a 3-D, ball-and-stick model of the arrangement of the sulfur atoms. The shape is clearly not octagonal as it is represented in the structural formula. Figure C is a space-filling model that shows each sulfur atom is partially embedded into the sulfur atom it bonds with.">\n            <caption>A molecule of sulfur is composed of eight sulfur atoms and is therefore written\n                as S<sub>8</sub>. It can be represented as (a) a structural formula, (b) a\n                ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. Sulfur atoms are represented by\n                yellow spheres. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a\n            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H<sub>2</sub> and 2H represent\n            distinctly different species. H<sub>2</sub> is a molecular formula; it represents a\n            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are\n            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate\n            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H<sub>2</sub> represents\n            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/hydrogen_models.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="This figure shows four diagrams. The diagram for H shows a single, white sphere and is labeled one H atom. The diagram for 2 H shows two white spheres that are not bonded together. It is labeled 2 H atoms. The diagram for H subscript 2 shows two white spheres bonded together. It is labeled one H subscript 2 molecule. The diagram for 2 H subscript 2 shows two sets of bonded, white spheres. It is labeled 2 H subscript 2 molecules.">\n            <caption>The symbols H, 2H, H<sub>2</sub>, and 2H<sub>2</sub> represent very different\n                entities. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the\n            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium\n            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of\n            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present\n            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.\n            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,\n            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO<sub>2</sub>. This identifies\n            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and\n            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the\n            element titanium.</p>\n        <p>As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which\n            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the\n            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from\n            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum\n            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be\n            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen\n            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the\n            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals\n            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the\n            molecular formula for benzene is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/benzene_models.png" width="600"\n            alt="Figure A shows that benzene is composed of six carbons shaped like a hexagon. Every other bond between the carbon atoms is a double bond. Each carbon also has a single bonded hydrogen atom. Figure B shows a 3-D, ball-and-stick drawing of benzene. The six carbon atoms are black spheres while the six hydrogen atoms are smaller, white spheres. Figure C is a space-filling model of benzene which shows that most of the interior space is occupied by the carbon atoms. The hydrogen atoms are embedded in the outside surface of the carbon atoms.">\n            <caption>Benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is produced during oil refining and has\n                many industrial uses. A benzene molecule can be represented as (a) a structural\n                formula, (b) a ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>If we know a compound\xe2\x80\x99s formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is\n            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual\n            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives\n            vinegar its sharp taste, is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic\n            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of\n            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,\n            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH<sub>2</sub>O. Note that a\n            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/acetic_acid_models.png" width="600"\n            alt="The left image shows a structural formula for acetic acid which contains two carbon atoms connected by a single bond. The left carbon atom forms single bonds with three hydrogen atoms. The right carbon atom forms a double bond with an oxygen atom. The right carbon atom also forms a single bond with an oxygen atom. This oxygen forms a single bond with a hydrogen atom. The right image shows a 3-D ball-and-stick model of acetic acid.">\n            <caption>Vinegar contains acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which has an empirical formula of CH<sub>2</sub>O.
