As mentioned previously, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal,\r\n\t\t\tmeaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature\r\n\t\t\tare not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these\r\n\t\t\tdeviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.</p>\r\n\t\t<p id="fd5188e0577c4c8b8a685feb3b0947ae">The KMT assumes that the volume of gas particles is\r\n\t\t\tzero. This assumption can be made because the volume of the individual gas particles is\r\n\t\t\tnegligible compared to the volume of the container that the gas is in. Observe in the\r\n\t\t\tanimation below that as the pressure of the gas increases the volume of the gas\r\n\t\t\tparticles will take up a larger percentage of the container. Therefore as pressure\r\n\t\t\tincreases, gases become less ideal. Gas volumes predicted by the ideal gas equation will\r\n\t\t\tbe slightly larger than the actual volume. As pressure increases this difference will\r\n\t\t\tbecome greater. The difference becomes very significant at 10 atm.</p>\r\n\t\t<image id="ddf1cda5363a43e295bfcf30f56c6d2a" src="../webcontent/nonideal1.gif"\r\n\t\t\talt="Animation of enclosed gas.
