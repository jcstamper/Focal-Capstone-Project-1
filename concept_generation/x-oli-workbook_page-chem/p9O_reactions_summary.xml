Balanced equations are\n                    those whose coefficients result in equal numbers of atoms for each element in\n                    the reactants and products. Chemical reactions in aqueous solution that involve\n                    ionic reactants or products may be represented more realistically by complete\n                    ionic equations and, more succinctly, by net ionic equations.</p>\n                \n                <p>Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A\n                    large number of important reactions are included in three categories:\n                    precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation\n                    reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base\n                    reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants. Redox\n                    reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant\n                    elements. </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n     \n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link\n            href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"> Openstax\n            Chemistry</link>under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons\n                Attribution 4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
