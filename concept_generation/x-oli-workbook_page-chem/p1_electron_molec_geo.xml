A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds\n                    that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or\n                    bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the\n                    straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in \xc3\x85ngstroms (1 \xc3\x85\n                    = 10<sup>\xe2\x80\x9310</sup> m) or picometers (1 pm = 10<sup>\xe2\x80\x9312</sup> m, 100 pm = 1\n                    \xc3\x85).</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/methane.PNG" width="350"\n                    alt="Diagram of tetrahedral bond shape showing a bond angle of 109.5 degrees and a bond length of 1.09 angstroms.">\n                    <caption>Bond distances (lengths) and angles are shown for the formaldehyde\n                        molecule, CH<sub>4</sub>.</caption>\n                </image>\n                <p>Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict\n                    the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central\n                    atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron\n                    pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the\n                    valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes\n                    repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them.\n                    The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs\n                    of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The\n                    electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions\n                    of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as\n                    possible.</p>\n                <p>VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom\n                    and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should\n                    understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions.\n                    Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron\n                    attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a\n                    particular molecular structure.</p>\n                <p>As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous\n                        BeF<sub>2</sub> molecule. The Lewis structure of BeF<sub>2</sub> shows only\n                    two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone\n                    pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible,\n                    and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density\n                    is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom.

The electron-pair geometries\n                    (electron geometries) you determined in the previous activities describe all\n                    regions where electrons are located around the central atom. Molecular structure\n                    describes the location of the atoms around the central atom, not the\n                    electrons.</p>\n                <p>We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that\n                    includes all electron pairs the electron-pair geometry or electron geometry. The\n                    structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is\n                    called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as\n                    the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the\n                    central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on\n                    the central atom.</p>\n                <p>For example, the methane molecule, CH<sub>4</sub>, which is the major component\n                    of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon\n                    atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure.\n                    On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH<sub>3</sub>, also has four electron\n                    pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral\n                    electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is\n                    not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape\n                    of the molecule.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/vsepr3.png"\n                    alt="On the left, a Lewis structure shows a carbon atom single bonded to four hydrogen atoms.
