Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and\n            triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of \xcf\x83 and \xcf\x80 bonds.\n            Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid\n            orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, shows us that each\n            carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/multiple1.jpg"\n            alt="A Lewis structure is shown in which two carbon atoms are bonded together by a double bond. Each carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms by a single bond."\n            width="400"/>\n        <p>The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect\n            the \xcf\x83 bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid\n            orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p orbitals and the 2s orbital.\n            These orbitals form the C\xe2\x80\x93H single bonds and the \xcf\x83 bond in the C=C double bond. The \xcf\x80\n            bond in the C=C double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2p orbital\n            on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital\n            (lobes shown in red and blue in diagrams below) is perpendicular to the plane of the\n                sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a\n            side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis and form a \xcf\x80 bond.</p>\n\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/multiple2.jpg" width="600"\n            alt="A diagram is shown in two parts, connected by a right facing arrow labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cHybridization.\xe2\x80\x9d The left diagram shows an up-facing arrow labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cE.\xe2\x80\x9d To the lower right of the arrow is a short, horizontal line labeled, \xe2\x80\x9c2 s,\xe2\x80\x9d that has two vertical half-arrows facing up and down on it.

One C-C sigma bond results from the overlap of one sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbital from\n                one carbon atom with one sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbital from the other carbon atom. \n                \n                 Four C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds result\n                from the overlap between the C atoms\' sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals with s orbitals on the\n                hydrogen atoms. (b) The \xcf\x80 bond is formed by the side-by-side overlap of the two\n                unhybridized p orbitals in the two carbon atoms. The two lobes of the \xcf\x80 bond are\n                above and below the plane of the \xcf\x83 system. </caption>\n\n        </image>\n\n        <p>In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the\n            same plane. If the two planes of sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each\n            other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the \xcf\x80 bond.\n            The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable\n            bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between \xcf\x83 and \xcf\x80 bonds; rotation\n            around single (\xcf\x83) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not\n            depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other\n            words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the \xcf\x83\n            bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the\n            axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds;\n            however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the \xcf\x80 bonding orbitals,\n            essentially breaking the \xcf\x80 bond.</p>\n        <p>In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom. We\n            find this situation in acetylene, H\xe2\x88\x92C\xe2\x89\xa1C\xe2\x88\x92H, which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid\n            orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a \xcf\x83 bond between the carbon\n            atoms. The remaining sp orbitals form \xcf\x83 bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized\n            p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence,\n            form two \xcf\x80 bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one \xcf\x83\n            bond and two \xcf\x80 bonds, giving a triple bond.</p>\n\n        <image src="../webcontent/multiple4.jpg" width="400"\n            alt="A diagram of a carbon atom with two balloon-like purple orbitals labeled, \xe2\x80\x9csp\xe2\x80\x9d arranged in a linear fashion around it is shown.
