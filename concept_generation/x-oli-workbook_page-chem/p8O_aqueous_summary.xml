Many solutions contain one component, called\n                    the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An\n                    aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a\n                    solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of\n                    solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very\n                    useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter\n                    of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding\n                    solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple\n                    relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after\n                    dilution.</p>\n                \n                <p>In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used\n                    in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution\n                    components\xe2\x80\x99 masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high\n                    concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using\n                    ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other\n                    fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
