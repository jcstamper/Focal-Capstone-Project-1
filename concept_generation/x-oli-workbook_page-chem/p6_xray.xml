Diffraction is the change in the direction of\n            travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier\n            whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are\n            electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between\n            neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few angstroms (1 \xc3\x85 = 1 \xc3\x97\n            10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9210</sup> m)). </p>\n        <p id="b5ff1d600b1f47b3b9d1ab073e67c6a7">When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a\n            crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When\n            scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo\n            interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a\n            decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining\n            waves\xe2\x80\x99 maxima are separated as shown below.</p>\n        <p id="b452c964bb8f4f34b5e5c6bfea2acb15"/>\n        <image id="ffc3852d5dd14f839419f6710da3c685" src="../webcontent/U8M3_Xray_1.jpg"\n            alt="A pair of images is shown that has four sections.
