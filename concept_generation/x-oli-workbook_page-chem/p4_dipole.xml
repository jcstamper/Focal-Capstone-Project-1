This separation of charge gives rise to a <extra><anchor>bond dipole moment</anchor><meaning><material><p>separation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector</p></material></meaning></extra>. The\n            magnitude of a bond <extra><anchor>dipole moment</anchor><meaning><material><p>property of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure</p></material></meaning></extra> is represented by the Greek letter mu (\xc2\xb5) and is given\n            by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined\n            by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:</p>\n        <formula>$$\\mu\\;=\\;Qr\\;$$</formula>\n        <p>This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and\n            magnitude. Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less\n            electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on\n            the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The\n            length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference\n            between the two atoms.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/dipole1.jpg"\n            alt="Two images are shown and labeled, \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d Image a shows a large sphere labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cC,\xe2\x80\x9d a left-facing arrow with a crossed end, and a smaller sphere labeled \xe2\x80\x9cH.\xe2\x80\x9d Image b shows a large sphere labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cB,\xe2\x80\x9d a right-facing arrow with a crossed end, and a smaller sphere labeled \xe2\x80\x9cF.\xe2\x80\x9d">\n            <caption>(a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H,\n                represented as a short vector. (b) The electronegativity difference between B and F\n                is much larger, so the vector representing the bond moment is much longer.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular\n            structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the\n            molecule is said to be a <extra><anchor>polar molecule</anchor><meaning><material><p>(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment</p></material></meaning></extra> (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to\n            be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the\n            molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in\n            three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.</p>\n        <p>For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the\n            molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br<sub>2</sub> and\n                N<sub>2</sub> have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is\n            zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF,\n            there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in\n            electronegativity.</p>\n        <p> When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If\n            the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum\n            equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO<sub>2</sub>.\n            Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis\n            structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is\n            linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments\n            cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water\n            molecule, the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom,\n            and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero\n            bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone\n            pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net\n            dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/dipole3.jpg"\n            alt="Two images are shown and labeled, \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d Image a shows a carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms in a ball-and-stick representation.

(a) Each CO bond has a bond dipole moment, but\n                they point in opposite directions so that the net CO<sub>2</sub> molecule is\n                nonpolar.

Although C and S have very similar electronegativity\n            values, S is slightly more electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly\n            polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, the oxygen end of the\n            molecule is the negative end. The OCS molecule is polar.</p>\n        <p> Chloromethane, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, is another example of a polar molecule. Although the\n            polar C\xe2\x80\x93Cl and C\xe2\x80\x93H bonds are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry, the C\xe2\x80\x93Cl bonds have a\n            larger bond moment than the C\xe2\x80\x93H bond, and the bond moments do not completely cancel each\n            other. All of the dipoles have a downward component in the orientation shown, since\n            carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and less electronegative than chlorine. The\n                CH<sub>3</sub>Cl molecule is polar. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/dipole5.jpg"\n            alt="An image shows a carbon atom single bonded to three hydrogen atoms and a chlorine atom.

The bonds in these molecules\n            are arranged such that their dipoles cancel. However, just because a molecule contains\n            identical bonds does not mean that the dipoles will always cancel. Many molecules that\n            have identical bonds and lone pairs on the central atoms have bond dipoles that do not\n            cancel because their molecular shape is not symmetrical. Examples include H<sub>2</sub>S and NH<sub>3</sub>.

We can use an electrically charged object to attract\n                    polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents\n                    are better at dissolving polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at\n                    dissolving nonpolar substances. </p>\n\n                <image src="../webcontent/dipole7.jpg" width="700"\n                    alt="Two diagrams are shown and labeled, \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d Diagram a shows two vertical, black lines.
