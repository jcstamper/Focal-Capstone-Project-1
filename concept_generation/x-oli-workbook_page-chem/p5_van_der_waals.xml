The \xe2\x80\x9ccorrection\xe2\x80\x9d to the pressure term in the ideal gas law is\n                (n<sup>2</sup>a)/v<sup>2</sup>, and the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrection\xe2\x80\x9d to the volume is nb. Note that\n            when V is relatively large and n is relatively small, both of these correction terms\n            become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV =\n            nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules\n            is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure.\n            Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some common gases are given in\n            table below.</p>\n        <section>\n            <title>Values of van der Waals Constants for Some Common Gases</title>\n            <body>\n              <table>\n                  <title>Values of van der Waals Constants for Some Common Gases</title>\n                 <tr> <th>Gas</th>\n                  \n                  <th><em style="italic">a</em> (L<sup>2</sup> atm/mol<sup>2</sup>)</th>\n                  \n                  <th><em style="italic">b </em>(L/mol)</th></tr>\n                  \n                  <tr><td>N<sub>2</sub></td>\n                  \n                  <td>1.39</td>\n                  \n                 <td> 0.0391</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr><td>O<sub>2</sub></td>\n                  \n                <td>  1.36</td>\n                  \n          <td>        0.0318</td></tr>\n                  \n                 <tr> <td>CO<sub>2</sub></td>\n                  \n                 <td> 3.59</td>\n                  \n              <td>    0.0427</td></tr>\n                  \n                 <tr> <td>H<sub>2</sub>O</td>\n                  \n                <td>  5.46</td>\n                  \n                <td>  0.0305</td></tr>\n                  \n                <tr> <td> He</td>\n                  \n               <td>   0.0342</td>\n                  \n                <td>  0.0237</td></tr>\n                  \n                 <tr> <td>CCl<sub>4</sub></td>\n                  \n                <td>  20.4</td>\n                  \n               <td>   0.1383</td></tr>\n              </table>\n              \n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <wb:inline idref="van_lbd1bad5b38387c74130acd016b52e28d1ba" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n       \n        <p>At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than\n            the one for molecular volume, b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for\n            the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are\n            incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some\n            intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears\n            to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This\n            behavior is reflected by the \xe2\x80\x9cdips\xe2\x80\x9d in the graph seen below that we looked at earlier.\n            The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an\n            ideal gas, as pressure is raised. At very high pressures, the gas becomes less\n            compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly\n            significant fraction of the total gas volume.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/vdw2.png" width="600"\n            alt="A graph of the compressibility factor (Z) vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.">\n            <caption>This graph shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the\n                behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.</caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions\n            between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an\n            appreciable part of the whole volume.

The value is somewhat\n                different because CO<sub>2</sub> molecules do have some volume and attractions\n                between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or\n                attractions.</p>\n        </example>\n        <wb:inline idref="van_lbd2b98388f4581346a38a37bcf9b5a16a89" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n        <wb:inline idref="van_digtf3fc685f86634a2ab4cfa56c9874ab85" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n\n               <p>Adapted from <link href="http://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface">\n                Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\n                License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n                href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n                >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
