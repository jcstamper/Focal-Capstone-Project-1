A\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbarometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile\r\n\t\t\t\t\tliquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that\r\n\t\t\t\t\tliquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcolumn of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsurface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\ttube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<image id="c2b9d64e8d2d4f8fa94959086e8d8e58" src="../webcontent/barometer.jpg"\r\n\t\t\t\t\talt="This figure shows two barometers. The barometer to the left contains a shallow reservoir, or open container, of mercury. A narrow tube extends upward from the reservoir above the reservoir. This tube is sealed at the top. To the right, a second similar setup is shown with a reservoir filled with water. Line segments connect the label \xe2\x80\x9cvacuum\xe2\x80\x9d to the tops of the two narrow tubes. The tube on the left shows the mercury in the reservoir extending in a column upward in the narrow tube. Similarly, the tube on the right shows the water in the reservoir extending upward into the related narrow tube. Double-headed arrows extend from the surface of each liquid in the reservoir to the top of the liquid in each tube. A narrow column or bar extends from the surface of the reservoir to the same height.
