In these reactions, water serves as\n                            both a solvent and a reactant. A neutralization reaction is a specific\n                            type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a\n                            base, the products are often a salt and water, and neither reactant is\n                            the water itself:</p>\n                        <formula>$$\\mathrm{acid}\\;+\\;\\mathrm{base}\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;\\mathrm{salt}\\;+\\;\\mathrm{water}$$</formula>\n\n\n                        <p>To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a\n                            typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an aqueous suspension of solid\n                                Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> is ingested to ease symptoms associated with\n                            excess stomach acid (HCl):</p>\n                        <formula>$$\\mathrm{Mg}(\\mathrm{OH})_2(s)\\;+\\;2\\;\\mathrm{HCl}(aq)\\;\\;\\longrightarrow\\;\\;{\\mathrm{MgCl}}_2(aq)\\;+\\;2\\;{\\mathrm\n                            H}_2\\mathrm O(l)$$</formula>\n\n\n\n                        <p>Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium\n                            chloride.</p>\n\n                        <example>\n\n                            <p>Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the\n                                following reaction:</p>\n\n                            <p>The weak acid hydrogen hypochlorite reacts with water.</p>\n\n                            <p>The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H<sub>2</sub>O.
