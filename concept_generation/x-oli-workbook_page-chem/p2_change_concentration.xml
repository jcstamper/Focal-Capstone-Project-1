The concentrations of both\n            reactants and products then undergo additional changes to return the system to\n            equilibrium.</p>\n        <p>Consider the reversible reaction:</p>\n        <formula> A + B \xe2\x87\x8c C + D</formula>\n        <p>Suppose that the stress that is applied is the addition of a reactant, A or B.\n            LeChatlier\'s principle says that the system will respond in a way that counters this\n            stress. In this example the stress increased the concentration of a reactant so the\n            system will shift in the forward direction to decrease the concentration of reactants.\n            Similarly, if either product, C or D is added the system will shift in the reverse\n            direction to counter the stress by decreasing the concentrations of the products. </p>\n        <p>Chemical species can also be removed from the system. If the concentration of reactant, A\n            or B is decreased The system will shift in the reverse direction to counter the stress\n            by increasing the reactant concentrations. If product is removed, the system will shift\n            in the forward direction to counter the stress by increasing the concentration of\n            products.</p>\n        <wb:inline idref="change_conc_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n       \n        <wb:inline idref="change_conc_digt" purpose="didigetthis"/>\n        <wb:inline idref="change_conc_digt2" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
