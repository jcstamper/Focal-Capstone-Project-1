Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and their changes. In this unit, you\n            will be presented with foundational concepts related to matter including defining\n            matter, recognizing different categories of matter, and understanding the atomic makeup\n            of matter. Chemistry involves extensive use of mathematics. Here you will be introduced\n            to dimensional analysis, which is a core mathematical method that you will use\n            throughout the rest of the course. Chemistry has a unique shorthand for representing\n            chemical formulas. You must learn this shorthand well, as you will encounter it\n            throughout the entire course. Additionally, in this unit you will learn about some\n            important scientists and experiments that have helped to shape our understanding of\n            matter on the atomic scale.</p>-->\n        <section>\n            <title>Chemistry: The Central Science</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Chemistry is sometimes referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cthe central science\xe2\x80\x9d due to its\n                    interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for\n                    areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).\n                    Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine,\n                    materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields.\n                  The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many\n                    aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines\n                    within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry.\n                    Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools\n                    that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the\n                    chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial\n                    to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living\n                    organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and\n                    nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce\n                    useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture,\n                    food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide\n                    sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world\xe2\x80\x99s population. Medicine,\n                    pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that\n                    help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and\n                    atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand\n                    and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the\n                    universe in astronomy and cosmology.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_01_01_ChemWeb.jpg" width="650" alt="A flowchart shows a box containing chemistry at its center. Chemistry is connected to geochemistry, nuclear chemistry, chemical physics, nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials science, chemical engineering, biochemistry and molecular biology, environmental science, agriculture, and mathematics. Each of these disciplines is further connected to other related fields including medicine, biology, food science, geology earth sciences, toxicology, physics, and computer science.">\n                    <caption>Knowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of\n                        scientific disciplines. This diagram shows just some of the\n                        interrelationships between chemistry and other fields.</caption>\n                </image>\n                <p>What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and\n                    assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing,\n                    containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and\n                    other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you\n                    will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and\n                    structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their\n                    causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws\n                    involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the\n                    study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice\n                    of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens\n                    whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead\n                    to such changes.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Domains of Chemistry</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and their changes. Chemists study and\n                    describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains:\n                    macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of\n                    considering and describing chemical behavior.</p>\n                <p>Macro is a Greek word that means \xe2\x80\x9clarge.\xe2\x80\x9d The macroscopic domain is familiar to\n                    us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed\n                    directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat\n                    and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday\n                    and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical\n                    properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability.</p>\n                <p>The microscopic domain of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination.\n                    Micro also comes from Greek and means \xe2\x80\x9csmall.\xe2\x80\x9d Some aspects of the microscopic\n                    domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite\n                    or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye,\n                    but when we\xe2\x80\x99re suffering from a cold, we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded of how real they are.</p>\n                <p>However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry\xe2\x80\x94such as\n                    atoms and molecules\xe2\x80\x94are too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and\n                    often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain\n                    include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of\n                    which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms\n                    in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual\n                    molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules\n                    into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms\n                    together are created.</p>\n                <p>The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent\n                    components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as\n                    those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are\n                    part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider\n                    calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important\n                    role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic\n                    domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the\n                    challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols\n                    can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and\n                    one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that\n                    must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.</p>\n                <p>A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous\n                    substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze\n                    to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher\n                    temperatures are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall\n                    into the microscopic domain\xe2\x80\x94what we cannot observe with the naked eye. The\n                    description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and\n                    the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these\n                    molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H<sub>2</sub>O, which can describe\n                    water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the\n                    symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for gas, (s) for solid, and (l) for\n                    liquid are also symbolic.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/iceberg.jpg"\n                    alt="Figure A shows a photo of an iceberg floating in a sea has three arrows. Each arrow points to figure B, which contains three diagrams showing how the water molecules are organized in the air, ice, and sea. In the air, which contains the gaseous form of water, H subscript 2 O gas, the water molecules are disconnected and widely spaced. In the ice, which is the solid form of water, H subscript 2 O solid, the water molecules are bonded together into rings, with each ring containing six water molecules. Three of these rings are connected to each other. In the sea, which is the liquid form of water, H subscript 2 O liquid, the water molecules are very densely packed. The molecules are not bonded together." width="650">\n                    <caption>(a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the\n                        macroscopic domain. (b) At the molecular level (microscopic domain), gas\n                        molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close\n                        together and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and\n                        disorganized. (c) The formula H<sub>2</sub>O symbolizes water, and (g), (s),\n                        and (l) symbolize its phases. Note that clouds are actually comprised of\n                        either very small liquid water droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous\n                        water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it may be\n                        sensed as humidity.
