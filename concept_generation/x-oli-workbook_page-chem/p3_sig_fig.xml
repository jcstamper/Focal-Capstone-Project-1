If we \n            count eggs in a carton, we know exactly how many eggs the carton contains. The \n            numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12 \n            inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram. \n            Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain \n            to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.</p>\n        <section><title>Significant Figures in Measurement</title>\n        <body>\n          <p>The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, \n                are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should \n                make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface \n                of the liquid.</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/grad_cylinder_meas.jpg" width="600" alt="This diagram shows a 25 milliliter graduated cylinder filled with about 20.8 milliliters of fluid. The diagram zooms in on the meniscus, which is the curved surface of the water that is visible when the graduated cylinder is viewed from the side. You make the reading at the lowest point of the curve of the meniscus.">\n                <caption>To measure the volume of liquid in this graduated cylinder, you must mentally \n                    subdivide the distance between the 21 and 22 mL marks into tenths of a milliliter, \n                    and then make a reading (estimate) at the bottom of the meniscus.</caption>\n            </image>\n            \n            <p>Refer to the illustration in Figure above. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly \n                lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 \n                mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the \n                21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid\xe2\x80\x99s volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number \n                21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate \n                the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place \n                digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit \n                to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, \n                given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on \n                this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. \n                The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL.</p>\n            \n            <p>This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you \n                place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits \n                6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 \n                and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement \n                of \xc2\xb1 0.01 gram. If we weigh the quarter on a more sensitive balance, we may find that its mass is \n                6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. \n                Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the user\xe2\x80\x99s ability). \n                All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called <extra><anchor>significant \n                    figures</anchor><meaning><material><p>(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit</p></material></meaning></extra> or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you \n                stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows \xe2\x80\x9c120,\xe2\x80\x9d then the 1 (hundreds), \n                2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.</p>\n            \n            <p>All digits that are part of a measurement are significant digits. However, in some measurements \n                we must include zeros as place holders, it is these zeros that are not significant digits. \n                Let\'s look at an example. </p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/water_flask.jpg" width="300" alt="Erlenmeyer flask with clear liquid in it between 200 and 300 ml">\n           </image>\n            <p>Say that you wanted to record the volume of liquid in the flask pictured above. You can say with \n                certainty that the volume is between 200 and 300 ml and you can make an estimate that the volume \n                is closer to 200 than to 300. Your estimated digit would be in the tens place. Let\'s say you \n                estimate that a 2 should be in the tens place. The 2 in the hundreds place is a certain digit \n                and the 2 in the tens place is your estimated digit. However, you cannot record the volume as \n                22 ml. You would add a zero in the ones place to show the place values of the twos and record \n                the volume as 220 ml. In this example the 0 is not part of the measurement, as it is neither \n                a certain nor estimated digit, it is a placeholder and therefore not a significant digit.</p>\n            <wb:inline idref="exact_value_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n                <wb:inline idref="sig_fig_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n            <p>Here we will look at some guidelines to follow in determining whether or not digits in a measurement \n                are significant. All nonzero digits are always significant. The zeros are a little more complex. We \n                will use the terms \xe2\x80\x9cleading,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctrailing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccaptive\xe2\x80\x9d for the zeros and will consider how to deal \n                with them.</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/leading_trailing1.jpg" width="600" alt="The left diagram uses the example of 3090. The zero in the hundreds place is labeled \xe2\x80\x9ccaptive\xe2\x80\x9d and the zero in the ones place is labeled trailing. The right diagram uses the example 0.008020. The three zeros in the ones, tenths, and hundredths places are labeled \xe2\x80\x9cleading.\xe2\x80\x9d The zero in the ten-thousandths place is labeled \xe2\x80\x9ccaptive\xe2\x80\x9d and the zero in the millionths place is labeled \xe2\x80\x9ctrailing.\xe2\x80\x9d">\n            </image>\n            <p>Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This \n                is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the \n                left of where the decimal point would be located.</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/leading_trailing2.jpg" width="700" alt="The left diagram uses the example of 1267 meters. The number 1 is the first nonzero figure on the left. 1267 has 4 significant figures in total. The right diagram uses the example of 55.0 grams. The number 5 in the tens place is the first nonzero figure on the left. 55.0 has 3 significant figures. Note that the 0 is to the right of the decimal point and therefore is a significant figure.">\n            </image>\n            <p>Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never \n                significant\xe2\x80\x94they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/leading_trailing3.jpg" width="700" alt="The left diagram uses the example of 70.607 milliliters. The number 7 is the first nonzero figure on the left. 70.607 has 5 significant figures in total, as all figures are measured including the 2 zeros. The right diagram uses the example of 0.00832407 M L. The number 8 is the first nonzero figure on the left. 0.00832407 has 6 significant figures.">\n            </image>\n            <p>The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation and express the \n                number as 8.32407&times;10<sup>-3</sup>; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, \n                and 10<sup>-3</sup> locates the decimal point.</p>\n            <p>The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal \n                point location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate \n                where the decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation: \n                1.3&times;10<sup>3</sup> (two significant figures), 1.30&times;10<sup>3</sup> (three significant figures, if the \n                tens place was measured), or 1.300&times;10<sup>3</sup> (four significant figures, if the ones place was \n                also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is available, it is prudent to assume \n                that all trailing zeros are not significant.</p>\n            <image src="../webcontent/leading_trailing4.jpg" width="600" alt="This figure uses the example of 1300 grams. The one and the 3 are significant figures as they are clearly the result of measurement. The 2 zeros could be significant if they were measured or they could be placeholders.">\n            </image>\n             <wb:inline idref="num_sig_fig_lbd" purpose="learnbydoing"></wb:inline>\n                <wb:inline idref="num_sig_fig_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        </body>\n            \n        </section>\n        \n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p> \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n\n'
