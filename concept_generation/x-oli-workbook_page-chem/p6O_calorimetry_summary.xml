Heat is energy that is transferred between objects\n                    at different temperatures; it flows from a high to a low temperature. Chemical and\n                    physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI\n                    unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).</p>\n                \n                <p>Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the\n                    temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a\n                    substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature\n                    change it undergoes. </p>\n                <p>Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or\n                    physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that\n                    occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured\n                    quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the\n                    process using known mathematical relations. </p>\n                <p> Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between the system being studied\n                    and its surroundings. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by\n                    introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the\n                    energy content of food.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        \n      \n        \n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n        \n        \n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n\n'
