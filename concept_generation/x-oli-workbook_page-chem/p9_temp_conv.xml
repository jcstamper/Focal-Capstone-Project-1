One way we measure a change \n            in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract \n            when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume \n            as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we \n            can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler.</p>\n        <p>To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the \n            freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, at a pressure of 1.0 atm, 0 &deg;C \n            is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 &deg;C as the boiling temperature of water. The space \n            between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit \n            scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 &deg;F and the boiling temperature as 212 &deg;F. The space between \n            these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).</p>\n        <p>Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a \n            slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units \n            of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to \n            one another (y = mx). </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/temp_compare.jpg" width="600" alt="A thermometer is shown for the Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin scales. Under the Fahrenheit scale, the boiling point of water is 212 degrees while the freezing point of water is 32 degrees. Therefore, there are 180 Fahrenheit degrees between the boiling point of water and the freezing point of water. Under the Celsius scale, the boiling point of water is 100 degrees while the freezing point of water is 0 degrees. Therefore, there are 100 Celsius degrees between the boiling point and freezing point of water. Under the kelvin scale, the boiling point of water is 373.15 K, while the freezing point of water is 273.15 K. 233.15 K is equal to negative 40 degrees Celsius, which is also equal to negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit.">\n            <caption>The Fahrenheit, Celsius, and kelvin temperature scales are compared. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <section>\n            <title></title>\n            <body>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n                <dl>\n                    <dt>Conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius</dt>\n                    <dd>\n                        <p>To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:</p>\n                        <formula>$${\\mathrm T}_{{}^\\circ\\mathrm F}\\;=\\;\\frac95\\;\\times\\;{\\mathrm T}_{^\\circ\\mathrm C}\\;+\\;32$$</formula>\n                        <p>To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:</p>\n                        <formula>$${\\mathrm T}_{{}^\\circ\\mathrm C}\\;=\\;\\frac59\\;({\\mathrm T}_{^\\circ\\mathrm F}\\;-\\;32)$$</formula>\n                        \n                    </dd>\n                </dl>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n                \n            </body>\n        </section>\n      \n      \n       \n        <p>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit \n            scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature \n            that can theoretically be achieved. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas\'s volume and \n            temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at \xe2\x88\x92273.15 &deg;C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson, \n            who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment \n            of this topic is provided later in this course).  A degree Celsius is the same size as  a Kelvin.</p>\n      \n       <section>\n           <title></title>\n           <body>\n               <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n               <dl>\n                   <dt>Conversions between Celsius and Kelvin</dt>\n                   <dd>\n                       <p>To convert Celsius to Kelvin:</p>\n                       <formula>$${\\mathrm T}_\\mathrm K\\;=\\;{\\mathrm T}_{^\\circ\\mathrm C}\\;+\\;273.15$$</formula>\n                       <p>To convert Kelvin to Celsius:</p>\n                       <formula>$${\\mathrm T}_{^\\circ\\mathrm C}\\;=\\;{\\mathrm T}_\\mathrm K\\;-\\;273.15$$</formula>\n                   </dd>\n               </dl>\n               <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>\n               \n           </body>\n       </section>\n        \n       \n      \n     \n        <p>Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in \n            many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world.
