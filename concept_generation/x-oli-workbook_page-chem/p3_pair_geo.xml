Larger molecules do\n                    not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms\n                    that each possess a \xe2\x80\x9clocal\xe2\x80\x9d geometry. The way these local structures are\n                    oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but\n                    such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory\n                    discussion.
