The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter\n            is often small enough that we can neglect it (though not for highly accurate\n            measurements, as discussed later), and the calorimeter minimizes energy exchange with\n            the surroundings. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical\n            reaction, there is no overall energy change during the reaction. The heat produced or\n            consumed in the reaction (the \xe2\x80\x9csystem\xe2\x80\x9d), <em style="italic">q</em><sub>reaction</sub>, plus the heat absorbed or lost by\n            the solution (the \xe2\x80\x9csurroundings\xe2\x80\x9d), <em style="italic">q</em><sub>solution</sub>, must add up to zero:</p>\n        <formula><em style="italic">q</em><sub>reaction</sub> + <em style="italic"\n                >q</em><sub>solution</sub> = 0 </formula>\n        <p>This means that the amount of heat produced or consumed in the reaction equals the amount\n            of heat absorbed or lost by the solution:</p>\n        <formula><em style="italic">q</em><sub>reaction</sub> = \xe2\x88\x92 <em style="italic"\n                >q</em><sub>solution</sub>\n        </formula>\n        <p>This concept lies at the heart of all calorimetry problems and calculations.</p>\n        <example>\n            <p>When 50.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl(aq) and 50.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH(aq), both at 22.0 \xc2\xb0C, are\n                added to a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum\n                of 28.9 \xc2\xb0C. What is the approximate amount of heat produced by this reaction?</p>\n            <formula>HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \xe2\x9f\xb6 NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</formula>\n            <p>To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so\n                quickly that no reaction took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the\n                reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have 100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl\n                and NaOH at 22.0 \xc2\xb0C. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution temperature\n                reaches 28.9 \xc2\xb0C.</p>\n            <p> The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution.\n                Therefore: </p>\n            <formula><em style="italic">q</em><sub>reaction</sub> = \xe2\x88\x92 <em style="italic"\n                    >q</em><sub>solution</sub>\n            </formula>\n\n            <p>(It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter\n                does not absorb any heat from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between\n                the calorimeter and its surroundings.)</p>\n            <p>Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat,\n                mass, and temperature change:</p>\n            <formula><em style="italic">q</em><sub>solution</sub> = (<em style="italic">c</em> \xc3\x97 <em\n                    style="italic">m</em> \xc3\x97 \xce\x94<em style="italic">T</em>)<sub>solution</sub> </formula>\n            <p>To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions\n                or approximations. Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water\n                in terms of its specific heat and mass values. The density of water is approximately\n                1.0 g/mL, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about 1.0 \xc3\x9710<sup>2</sup> g (two significant\n                figures). The specific heat of water is approximately 4.184 J/g \xc2\xb0C, so we use that\n                for the specific heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives:</p>\n            <formula><em style="italic">q</em><sub>solution</sub> = (4.184 J/g \xc2\xb0C)(1.0 \xc3\x97\n                    10<sup>2</sup> g)(28.9 \xc2\xb0C\xe2\x88\x9222.0 \xc2\xb0C) = 2.89 \xc3\x97 10<sup>3</sup> J </formula>\n            <p>Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have:</p>\n            <formula><em style="italic">q</em><sub>reaction</sub> = \xe2\x88\x92<em style="italic"\n                    >q</em><sub>solution</sub> = \xe2\x88\x922.89 \xc3\x97 10<sup>3</sup> J</formula>\n            <p>The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic. It produces 2.89 kJ of\n                heat.</p>\n        </example>\n\n        <wb:inline idref="cal_chem_lbd1" purpose="learnbydoing"/>\n\n        <section>\n            <title>Bomb Calorimeter</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>If the amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is too large to neglect or if we\n                    require more accurate results, then we must take into account the heat absorbed\n                    both by the solution and by the calorimeter.</p>\n                <p>The calorimeters described above are designed to operate at constant (atmospheric)\n                    pressure and are convenient to measure heat flow accompanying processes that\n                    occur in solution. A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant\n                    volume, colloquially known as a <extra><anchor>bomb calorimeter</anchor><meaning><material><p>device designed to measure the energy change for processes occurring under conditions of constant volume; commonly used for reactions involving solid and gaseous reactants or products</p></material></meaning></extra>, is used to measure the energy\n                    produced by reactions that yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products,\n                    such as combustion reactions. (The term \xe2\x80\x9cbomb\xe2\x80\x9d comes from the observation that\n                    these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage\n                    other calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel\n                    container (the \xe2\x80\x9cbomb\xe2\x80\x9d) that contains the reactants and is itself submerged in\n                    water, as seen in the image below. The sample is placed in the bomb, which is\n                    then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to\n                    ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is trapped in the steel\n                    bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along\n                    with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy\n                    produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the\n                    heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. Once the heat\n                    capacity of the bomb calorimeter is determined, this is taken into consideration\n                    in the calculation for <em style="italic">q</em><sub>reaction</sub>.</p>\n               \n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>     \n                <dl>\n                    <dt><em>Heat of Reaction as Determined by a Bomb</em>\n                        Calorimeter</dt>\n                    <dd>\n                        <formula>$$q_\\mathrm{reaction}\\;=\\;-(q_\\mathrm{water}\\;+\\;q_\\mathrm{bomb})$$</formula>\n                        <p><em style="italic">q</em><sub>bomb</sub> is calculated by multiplying the\n                            heat capacity of the bomb, as determined by calibration, and the observed\n                            change in temperature caused by the reaction.</p>\n                        <formula>$$q_\\mathrm{bomb}\\;=\\;(C\\;\\times\\;\\mathrm\\Delta T)_\\mathrm{bomb}$$</formula>\n                       \n                    </dd>\n                </dl>\n                <image src="../../../webcontent/green_line.png"></image>     \n                  \n                <image src="../webcontent/bomb.jpg" alt="A picture and a diagram are shown, labeled a and b, respectively.
