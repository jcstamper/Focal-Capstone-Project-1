Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a\n                    molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only\n                    when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment\n                    measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is\n                    determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a\n                    molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond\n                    moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar\n                    molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric\n                    fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not. </p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <title>End of Lesson Questions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the\n                    learning objectives for the <em style="italic">Ionic and Covalent Bonding</em> module and use the\n                    <em style="emphasis">My Response</em> link below to ask any questions you might have about\n                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.
