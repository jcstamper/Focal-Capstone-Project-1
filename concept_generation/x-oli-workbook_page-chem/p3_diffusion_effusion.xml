Although gaseous molecules\n\t\t\ttravel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with other\n\t\t\tgaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired\n\t\t\ttarget. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions\n\t\t\tper second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between\n\t\t\tcollisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the mean\n\t\t\tfree path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the\n\t\t\tmolecule.</p>\n\t\t<p>In general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed\n\t\t\tcontainer, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by\n\t\t\twhich molecules disperse in space in response to differences in concentration is called\n\t\t\tdiffusion (shown in Figure). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware of\n\t\t\tany concentration gradient, they simply move randomly\xe2\x80\x94regions of higher concentration\n\t\t\thave more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of\n\t\t\tspecies from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment,\n\t\t\tdiffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, as depicted\n\t\t\tbelow. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations\n\t\t\tare the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net\n\t\t\ttransfer of molecules occurs).</p>\n\t\t<image src="../webcontent/diffusion1.jpeg" width="600"\n\t\t\talt="In this figure, three pairs of gas filled spheres or vessels are shown connected with a stopcock between them. In a, the figure is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cStopcock closed.\xe2\x80\x9d Above, the left sphere is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cH subscript 2.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains approximately 30 small, white, evenly distributed circles. The sphere to its right is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cO subscript 2.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains approximately 30 small red evenly distributed circles. In b, the figure is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cStopcock open.\xe2\x80\x9d The stopcock valve handle is now parallel to the tube connecting the two spheres. On the left, approximately 9 small, white circles and 4 small, red circles are present, with the red spheres appearing slightly closer to the stopcock. On the right side, approximately 25 small, red spheres and 21 small, white spheres are present, with the concentration of white spheres slightly greater near the stopcock. In c, the figure is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cSome time after Stopcock open.\xe2\x80\x9d In this situation, the red and white spheres appear evenly mixed and uniformly distributed throughout both spheres.">\n\t\t\t<caption>(a) Two gases, H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, are initially separated. (b)\n\t\t\t\tWhen the stopcock is opened, they mix together. The lighter gas, H<sub>2</sub>,\n\t\t\t\tpasses through the opening faster than O<sub>2</sub>, so just after the stopcock is\n\t\t\t\topened, more H<sub>2</sub> molecules move to the O<sub>2</sub> side than\n\t\t\t\t\tO<sub>2</sub> molecules move to the H<sub>2</sub> side. (c) After a short time,\n\t\t\t\tboth the slower-moving O<sub>2</sub> molecules and the faster-moving H<sub>2</sub>\n\t\t\t\tmolecules have distributed themselves evenly on both sides of the vessel. </caption>\n\t\t</image>\n\t\t<p>We are often interested in the rate of diffusion, the amount of gas passing through some\n\t\t\tarea per unit time:</p>\n\t\t<p><formula>$$\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ diffusion} = \\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ of\\ gas\\ passing\\\n\t\t\t\tthrough\\ an\\ area}}{\\mathrm{unit\\ of\\ time}}$$</formula></p>\n\t\t<p>The diffusion rate depends on several factors: the concentration gradient (the increase\n\t\t\tor decrease in concentration from one point to another); the amount of surface area\n\t\t\tavailable for diffusion; and the distance the gas particles must travel. Note also that\n\t\t\tthe time required for diffusion to occur is inversely proportional to the rate of\n\t\t\tdiffusion, as shown in the rate of diffusion equation. </p>\n\t\t<p>A process involving movement of gaseous species similar to diffusion is effusion, the\n\t\t\tescape of gas molecules through a tiny hole such as a pinhole in a balloon into a vacuum\n\t\t\t(Figure). Although diffusion and effusion rates both depend on the molar mass of the gas\n\t\t\tinvolved, their rates are not equal; however, the ratios of their rates are the same. </p>\n\t\t<image src="../webcontent/diffusion2.jpeg" width="600"\n\t\t\talt="This figure contains two cylindrical containers which are oriented horizontally. The first is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cDiffusion.\xe2\x80\x9d In this container, approximately 25 purple and 25 green circles are shown, evenly distributed throughout the container. \xe2\x80\x9cTrails\xe2\x80\x9d behind some of the circles indicate motion. In the second container, which is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cEffusion,\xe2\x80\x9d a boundary layer is evident across the center of the cylindrical container, dividing the cylinder into two halves. A black arrow is drawn pointing through this boundary from left to right. To the left of the boundary, approximately 16 green circles and 20 purple circles are shown again with motion indicated by \xe2\x80\x9ctrails\xe2\x80\x9d behind some of the circles.

Effusion\n\t\t\t\toccurs when a gas passes through an opening that is smaller than the mean free path\n\t\t\t\tof the particles, that is, the average distance traveled between collisions.\n\t\t\t\tEffectively, this means that only one particle passes through at a time. </caption>\n\t\t</image>\n\t\t<p>If a mixture of gases is placed in a container with porous walls, the gases effuse\n\t\t\tthrough the small openings in the walls. The lighter gases pass through the small\n\t\t\topenings more rapidly (at a higher rate) than the heavier ones (Figure).
