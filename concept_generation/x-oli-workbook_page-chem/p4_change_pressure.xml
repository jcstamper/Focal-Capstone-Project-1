An easy way to recognize such a system is to look for\n            different numbers of moles of gas on the reactant and product sides of the equilibrium.\n            While evaluating pressure (as well as related factors like volume), it is important to\n            remember that equilibrium constants are defined with regard to concentration (for Kc) or\n            partial pressure (for KP). Some changes to total pressure, like adding an inert gas that\n            is not part of the equilibrium, will change the total pressure but not the partial\n            pressures of the gases in the equilibrium constant expression. Thus, addition of a gas\n            not involved in the equilibrium will not perturb the equilibrium.</p>\n\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
