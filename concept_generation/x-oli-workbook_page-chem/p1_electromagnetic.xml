At the botom of the figure is a numerical scale that is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cWavelength lambda ( m ).\xe2\x80\x9d This scale runs from 10 superscript negative 12 meters under gamma radiation increasing by powers of ten to a value of 10 superscript 3 meters at the far right under broadcast and wireless radio. X-ray appears around 10 superscript negative 10 meters, ultraviolet appears in the 10 superscript negative 8 to 10 superscript negative 7 range, visible light appears between 10 superscript negative 7 and 10 superscript negative 6, infrared appears in the 10 superscript negative 6 to 10 superscript negative 5 range, teraherz appears in the 10 superscript negative 4 to 10 superscript negative 3 range, microwave infrared appears in the 10 superscript negative 2 to 10 superscript negative 1 range, and broadcast and wireless radio extend from 10 to 10 superscript 3 meters. Labels above the scale are placed to indicate 1 n m at 10 superscript negative 9 meters, 1 micron at 10 superscript negative 6 meters, 1 millimeter at 10 superscript negative 3 meters, 1 centimeter at 10 superscript negative 2 meters, and 1 foot between 10 superscript negative 1 meter and 10 superscript 0 meters. Between the ultraviolet and infrared labels is a narrow band of violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red colors in narrow, vertical strips. From this narrow band, two dashed lines extend a short distance above to the left and right of an image of the visible spectrum. The image, which is labeled, \xe2\x80\x9cvisible light,\xe2\x80\x9d is just a broader version of the narrow bands of color in the label area.">\n            <caption>The electromagnetic spectrum showing each form of electromagnetic energy and\n                its corresponding wavelength. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in\n            chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and\n            molecules.
