It\n            is also possible for a liquid to freeze before its molecules become arranged in an\n            orderly pattern. The resulting materials are called amorphous solids or noncrystalline\n            solids (or, sometimes, glasses). The particles of such solids lack an ordered internal\n            structure and are randomly arranged.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_05_TypesSol.jpg" alt="Two images are shown and labeled, from left to right, \xe2\x80\x9cCrystalline\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAmorphous.\xe2\x80\x9d The crystalline diagram shows many circles drawn in rows and stacked together tightly.

Substances that\n            consist of large molecules, or a mixture of molecules whose movements are more\n            restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids\n            composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide (shown\n            below), can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions\n            under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the\n            crystalline state under appropriate conditions.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_10_05_BoronOxide.jpg" alt="Two sets of molecules are shown.
