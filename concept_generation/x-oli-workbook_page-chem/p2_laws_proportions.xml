The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of\n                    the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent\n                    with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a\n                    component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system)\n                    are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1,\n                    as shown in table below.</p>\n\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>Constant Composition of Isooctane</title>\n            <body>\n                <table>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Sample</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Mass of Carbon</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Mass of Hydrogen</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Mass Ratio</em></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>A</td>\n                        <td>14.82 g</td>\n                        <td>2.78 g</td>\n                        <td><formula>$$\\frac{14.82\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{carbon}\\;}{2.78\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{hydrogen}}\\;=\\;\\frac{5.33\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{carbon}}{1.00\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{hydrogen}}$$</formula></td>  \n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>B</td>\n                        <td>22.33 g</td>\n                        <td>4.19 g</td>\n                        <td><formula>$$\\frac{22.33\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{carbon}\\;}{4.19\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{hydrogen}}\\;=\\;\\frac{5.33\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{carbon}}{1.00\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{hydrogen}}$$</formula></td>  \n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>C</td>\n                        <td>19.40 g</td>\n                        <td>3.64 g</td>\n                        <td><formula>$$\\frac{19.40\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{carbon}\\;}{3.63\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{hydrogen}}\\;=\\;\\frac{5.33\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{carbon}}{1.00\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{hydrogen}}$$</formula></td>  \n                    </tr>\n                    \n                </table>\n                <p>It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the\n                    same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have\n                    the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there\n                    are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass\n                    ratio of 5.33:1.00.</p>\n\n            </body>\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n            <title>The Law of Multiple Proportions</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments,\n                    to formulate another interesting law. The <extra><anchor>law of multiple proportions</anchor><meaning><material><p>when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers</p></material></meaning></extra> states\n                    that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one\n                    element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\n                    numbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid\n                    with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown\n                    crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These\n                    ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative;\n                    however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly\n                    surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.</p>\n                <p><formula>$$\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{1.116\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{Cl}}{1\\;\\mathrm\n                        g\\;\\mathrm{Cu}}}{\\displaystyle\\frac{0.558\\;\\mathrm\n                        g\\;\\mathrm{Cl}}{1\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{Cu}}}\\;=\\;\\frac21$$</formula></p>\n                <p>This 2-to-1 ratio means that the brown compound has twice the amount of chlorine\n                    per amount of copper as the green compound.</p>\n                <p>This can be explained by atomic theory if the copper-to-chlorine ratio in the\n                    brown compound is 1 copper atom to 2 chlorine atoms, and the ratio in the green\n                    compound is 1 copper atom to 1 chlorine atom. The ratio of chlorine atoms (and\n                    thus the ratio of their masses) is therefore 2 to 1.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/copper_chlorine.jpg" width="600"\n                    alt="Figure A shows a pile of green powder. A callout shows that the green powder is made up of a lattice of copper atoms interspersed with chlorine atoms. The atoms are color coded brown for copper and green for chlorine. The number of copper atoms is equal to the number of chlorine atoms in the molecule. Figure B shows a pile of brown powder. A callout shows that the brown powder is also made up of copper and chlorine atoms similar to the molecule shown in figure A. However there appears to be two chlorine atoms for every copper atom in this molecule. The copper atoms in figure B bond with both the chlorine atoms and the other copper atoms.
