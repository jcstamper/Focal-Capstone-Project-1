Much of\n                    this came from the results of several seminal experiments that revealed the\n                    details of the internal structure of atoms. Here, we will discuss some of those\n                    key developments, with an emphasis on application of the scientific method, as\n                    well as understanding how the experimental evidence was analyzed. While the\n                    historical persons and dates behind these experiments can be quite interesting,\n                    it is most important to understand the concepts resulting from their work.</p>\n                <p>If matter were composed of atoms, what were atoms composed of? Were they the\n                    smallest particles, or was there something smaller? In the late 1800s, a number\n                    of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical\n                    discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most\n                    significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode\n                    ray tube.

The term \xe2\x80\x9celectron\xe2\x80\x9d was coined in 1891 by Irish physicist George Stoney,\n                    from \xe2\x80\x9celectric ion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n                <wb:inline idref="cathode_ray_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>The Oil Drop Experiment</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>In 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist\n                    Robert A. Millikan via his \xe2\x80\x9coil drop\xe2\x80\x9d experiments. Millikan created microscopic\n                    oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or\n                    by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their\n                    downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in\n                    the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful\n                    measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the\n                    charge on individual drops.</p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/oil_drop.png" width="400" alt="The experimental apparatus consists of an oil atomizer which sprays fine oil droplets into a large, sealed container. The sprayed oil lands on a positively charged brass plate with a pinhole at the center. As the drops fall through the pinhole, they travel through X-rays that are emitted within the container. This gives the oil droplets an electrical charge. The oil droplets land on a brass plate that is negatively charged. A telescopic eyepiece penetrates the inside of the container so that the user can observe how the charged oil droplets respond to the negatively charged brass plate.">\n                    <caption>Diagram of "oil drop" experiment apparatus.</caption>\n                </image>\n                <table>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Oil Drop</em></td>\n                        <td align="center"><em style="bold">Charge in Coulombs (C)</em></td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>A</td>\n                        <td>4.8 X 10<sup>-19</sup> C</td>\n                        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>B</td>\n                        <td>3.2 X 10<sup>-19</sup> C</td>\n                        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>C</td>\n                        <td>6.4 X 10<sup>-19</sup> C</td>\n                        </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>D</td>\n                        <td>1.6 X 10<sup>-19</sup> C</td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>E</td>\n                        <td>4.8 X 10<sup>-19</sup> C</td>\n                    </tr>\n                </table>\n                <p>Looking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that\n                    the charge of an oil droplet is always a multiple of a specific charge, 1.6 X\n                        10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> C. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a\n                    fundamental charge\xe2\x80\x94the charge of a single electron\xe2\x80\x94with his measured charges due\n                    to an excess of one electron (1 times 1.6 X 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> C), two electrons\n                    (2 times 1.6 X 10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> C), three electrons (3 times 1.6 X\n                        10<sup>\xe2\x88\x9219</sup> C), and so on, on a given oil droplet. Since the charge of\n                    an electron was now known due to Millikan\xe2\x80\x99s research, and the charge-to-mass\n                    ratio was already known due to Thomson\xe2\x80\x99s research (1.759 X 10<sup>11</sup>\n                    C/kg), it only required a simple calculation to determine the mass of the\n                    electron as well.</p>\n                <formula>$$\\mathrm{Mass}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{electron}\\;=\\;1.602\\;\\times\\;10^{-19}\\;\\mathrm\n                    C\\;\\times\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{kg}}{1.759\\;\\times\\;10^{11}\\mathrm\n                    C}\\;=\\;9.107\\;\\times\\;10^{-31}\\;\\mathrm{kg}$$</formula>\n                <p>Scientists had now established that the atom was not indivisible as Dalton had\n                    believed, and due to the work of Thomson, Millikan, and others, the charge and\n                    mass of the negative, subatomic particles\xe2\x80\x94the electrons\xe2\x80\x94were known.

In 1904, Thomson\n                    proposed the \xe2\x80\x9cplum pudding\xe2\x80\x9d model of atoms, which described a positively charged\n                    mass with an equal amount of negative charge in the form of electrons embedded\n                    in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral. </p>\n                <image src="../webcontent/plum_pudding.png" width="400" alt="Circle with positive charges on it.
