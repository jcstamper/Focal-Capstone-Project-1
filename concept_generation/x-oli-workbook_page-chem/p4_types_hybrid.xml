There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl<sub>2</sub>\n                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent Be\xe2\x80\x93Cl bonds. To accommodate these\n                    two electron domains, two of the Be atom\xe2\x80\x99s four valence orbitals will mix to\n                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the\n                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp\n                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals\n                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important\n                    difference. <em>The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number\n                        of hybrid orbitals formed.</em> The p orbital is one orbital that can hold\n                    up to two electrons.

For\n                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a\n                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The\n                    nitrogen atom is sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by\n                    the lone pair.</p>\n                <p>The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of\n                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen\n                    atom is sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by\n                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than\n                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly\n                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5\xc2\xb0, but the\n                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3\xc2\xb0) and water (104.5\xc2\xb0) are slightly smaller.\n                    Other examples of sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization include CCl<sub>4</sub>,\n                        PCl<sub>3</sub>, and NCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>\n            </body>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <title>sp<sup>3</sup>d and sp<sup>3</sup>d<sup>2</sup> Hybridization</title>\n            <body>\n                <p>To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we\n                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p\n                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp<sup>3</sup>d hybrid\n                    orbitals.

These hybridizations are only\n                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not\n                    those in the first or second period).</p>\n                <p>In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>, there are five P\xe2\x80\x93Cl\n                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed\n                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p\n                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp<sup>3</sup>d\n                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the P\xe2\x80\x93Cl bonds.
