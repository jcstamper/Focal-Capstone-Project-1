The topic of\n            spontaneity is critically important to the study of chemical thermodynamics and is\n            treated more thoroughly in a later unit. For purposes of this modules\xe2\x80\x99s discussion, it\n            will suffice to consider two criteria that favor, but do not guarantee, the spontaneous\n            formation of a solution:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>an increase in the disorder in the system (which indicates an increase in the\n                entropy of the system, as you will learn about in the later unit) </li>\n            <li>a decrease in the internal energy of the system (an exothermic change, as discussed\n                in the previous unit on thermochemistry)</li>\n\n        </ul>\n        <p>In the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as\n            heat is absorbed or evolved. An increase in disorder always results when a solution\n            forms.</p>\n        <p>When the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent\n            species in a solution are no different than those present in the separated components,\n            the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change. Such a solution is called an\n            ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which\n            closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities\n            comprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.</p>\n        <p> When containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to\n            diffusion and form a solution. The formation of this solution clearly involves an\n            increase in disorder, since the helium and argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as\n            that which each occupied before mixing. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_01_HeArsol.jpg" alt="Two figures are shown. The first contains two spherical containers joined by a closed stopcock. The container to the left is labeled H e. It holds about thirty evenly dispersed, small, light blue spheres. The container on the right is labeled A r and contains about thirty slightly larger blue-green spheres. The second, similar figure has an open stopcock between the two spherical containers. The light blue and green spheres are evenly dispersed and present in both containers." width="650">\n            <caption>Samples of helium and argon spontaneously mix to give a solution in which the\n                disorder of the atoms of the two gases is increased. </caption>\n        </image>\n        <p>This example illustrates how diffusion alone can provide the driving force required to\n            cause the spontaneous formation of a solution. </p>\n      \n     \n              <p>Three types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process:\n                  solute-solute, solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in the diagram below,\n                  the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process in which energy is\n                  consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic\n                  processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic\n                  process referred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes\n                  associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process\n                  overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the\n                  energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater than the\n                  energy released by solvation.</p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_01_solusolv.jpg" alt="The top, central region of the figure shows solute particles as seven blue spheres and solvent particles as 16 red spheres in separate, labeled boxes. The particles in these boxes are touching. An arrow labeled \xe2\x80\x9cStep 1\xe2\x80\x9d points left of the solute box, and shows the blue spheres no longer touching in another box labeled \xe2\x80\x9cexpanded solute.\xe2\x80\x9d An arrow labeled \xe2\x80\x9cStep 2\xe2\x80\x9d points right from the solvent box and shows the red spheres no longer touching in another box labeled \xe2\x80\x9cexpanded solvent.\xe2\x80\x9d Arrows proceed from the bottom of the expanded solute and expanded solvent boxes and join at the bottom of the figure where a step 3 label is shown.

The solute and solvent boxes are joined by another arrow labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdirect formation of solution\xe2\x80\x9d which points downward at the center of the figure. This arrow also points to the box containing mixed red and blue spheres near the bottom of the figure." width="600">\n                  <caption>This schematic representation of dissolution shows a stepwise process involving\n                      the endothermic separation of solute and solvent species (Steps 1 and 2) and\n                      exothermic solvation (Step 3).</caption>\n              </image>\n              <p>For example, cooking oils and water will not mix to any appreciable extent to yield\n                  solutions. Hydrogen bonding is the dominant intermolecular attractive force present in\n                  liquid water; the nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules of cooking oils are not capable of\n                  hydrogen bonding, instead being held together by dispersion forces. Forming an oil-water\n                  solution would require overcoming the very strong hydrogen bonding in water, as well as\n                  the significantly strong dispersion forces between the relatively large oil molecules.\n                  And, since the polar water molecules and nonpolar oil molecules would not experience\n                  very strong intermolecular attraction, very little energy would be released by\n                  solvation.</p>\n              <p>On the other hand, a mixture of ethanol and water will mix in any proportions to yield a\n                  solution. In this case, both substances are capable of hydrogen bonding, and so the\n                  solvation process is sufficiently exothermic to compensate for the endothermic\n                  separations of solute and solvent molecules.</p>\n              <p>As noted, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by exothermic\n                  dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the\n                  release of heat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate\n                  (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is one such example and is used to make instant cold\n                  packs for treating injuries. A thin-walled plastic bag\n                  of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. When the\n                  smaller bag is broken, a solution of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings\n                  (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that\n                  decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy\n                  input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated,\n                  but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies\n                  formation of the solution. </p>\n        <image src="../webcontent/CNX_Chem_11_01_Icepack.jpg" alt="This figure shows a single use instant cold pack with labels indicating an inner bag of water surrounded by white particulate ammonium nitrate." width="400">\n                  <caption>An instant cold pack gets cold when certain salts, such as ammonium nitrate, dissolve in water\xe2\x80\x94an endothermic process.</caption>\n              </image>\n              <wb:inline idref="formation_digt" purpose="didigetthis"></wb:inline>\n        <p>Adapted from <link href="https://cnx.org/contents/havxkyvS@9.422:b39avmGq@29/Preface"\n            >Openstax Chemistry</link> under  <link\n                href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution\n                4.0 License. </link></p>\n        <p>Download for free at <link\n            href="http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312"\n            >http://cnx.org/contents/85abf193-2bd2-4908-8563-90b8a7ac8df6@9.312.</link></p>\n\n    </body>\n</workbook_page>\n'
