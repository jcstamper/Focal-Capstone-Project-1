The data collection techniques for a sentiment analysis project analyzing social media tweets will differ from the techniques of an image classification project for patient diagnosis. When you defined the project&apos;s business and analytic objectives, the tasks and methods were proposed as well, those tasks and methods drive the type of data that will be used in the project. The type of data will influence the source and data collection techniques. Once you have completed this module, you will be able to distinguish between the various data types and sources, alongside the traditional data collection techniques. </p><p id="d7bcc6121bcc4d8488abc10cd4327d46"><em>Data Types </em></p><p id="dcd84647c388411b9beb0122e83100b1">Data holds value to businesses and can present itself in various forms. You identify data types as it affects the methods you will choose to develop an analytic solution. Data types are also dependent on its source, so you can consider the type of data according to how it is represented in its source. Reference the link below for a refresher on the common data types: </p><p id="bddacf9c965a4ea1abd988cbe9327cc1">Reading: <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type" target="new" internal="false">Classes of Data Types</link>.</p><p id="ad38df3d4aa04513a125319c54a46a76">When discussing data types in data science, data is typically categorized as numeric or categorical and classified as one of the four measurement scale types. <em style="italic">Numeric</em> data is represented as continuous or discrete values, while <em style="italic">categorical</em> data can be nominal or ordinal values. </p><table id="ab4b39e7e29744af9ff48c83a72e0b34" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="iafa96b689de9430aa8f684479d3a3419" /><caption><p id="fbd4b2240bf84e0e98f630e746cebaf6" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="cf8da2825e1b42f18f0dc46a0b0ea53b"><em>Numeric Data</em></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="d3569de61cf24324a5b37e4fd56ab5e3"><em>Categorical Data</em></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="cae235a9438e4ab381943ca40107da14">Discrete: There are <em>31 days</em> in the month of May</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="a089a3dbb9ca469cb6c21163e9b7b1ca">Ordinal: I can rate my customer service experience at the grocery store as <em>Good.</em></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="d92798fa900f48729d131539898262e1">Continuous: You were born on May 13th 1997 so as of May 28th 2020, you are <em>23 years, 2 weeks, and 1 day old.</em></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="e7560ded551d4c58beb4470134c8f539">Nominal: What is your hair color? <em>Brown.</em></p></td></tr></table><p id="f970b92946b24a00bfa8a786571da9cf"><em>Qualitative and Quantitative Data </em></p><p id="b0abeaa0b6dc48c39344441a556bcda9"><em style="italic">Quantitative</em> data is data that is expressed in numerically and derived from questions such as how many courses are you enrolled in this semester; how much do Data Scientists earn? Meanwhile, <em style="italic">qualitative </em>data is descriptive data that is collected from observations instead of measurements. Qualitative data is sometimes transformed to enable it to be used in certain machine learning modeling techniques that require quantitative data. Both data types are collected and analyzed in different ways. </p><p id="f6dfcbe0dfe845908c8209be65661c2a"><em>Structured and Unstructured Data</em></p><p id="a9a123808ab04eb2bc1e691e114ec524">Structured Data is organized facts that are presented in fixed formats and are easy to extract. This data can be stored in spreadsheets, relational databases and other repositories in the row and column format. Unstructured data is most difficult to extract, it is not easily stored in typical relational databases and spreadsheets because it does not fit in the row and column structure. It cannot be maintained in formats that are uniform. Text, multimedia files, and log files from servers are examples of unstructured data. New generation databases also known as NoSQL databases were built to handle unstructured data. Unlike structured data, unstructured data can be stored without a predefined schema. </p><p id="ed9d64b5bcf947009b74653171fadb1f"><em>Internal and External Data</em></p><p id="b37bc779f8bc46f496f91f215b5f5269">Data can also be classified as <em style="italic">Internal</em> data, which is data collected and/or controlled by an organization. An example would be personnel data collected and stored by the human resources department. We also have <em style="italic">External</em> data, data that is collected from sources outside of an organization. Census data, and data gathered from credit reporting agencies are examples of external data. </p><example id="a93b74879d944bf4acfb24a5225d9f2e"><title>Title</title><p id="ed8133d0d0684689924f686d15c44e9b">A company has surveyed its customers on their satisfaction with a newly released service.

Keep in mind that internal data can come from a primary or secondary data source and that an organization&apos;s data governance framework affect data that is collected from primary and secondary sources as long as they are used by the organization. </p><p id="a6439214f95e4dc498003688b5b0d180"><em><em style="italic">The Largest Data Source.</em></em>The web is considered the largest data source. Data from the web can be sourced from social media, search engines, and machine data. In the next module, we will focus on this source in depth.</p><example id="ae8b5656a9084d129e107c2a6d0da4ad"><title>Primary Data vs Secondary Data from Internal and External Sources.</title><p id="f802b4692330411584a00ace77041628">Primary data can be data that is collected by a data scientist from first hand sources like through questionnaires and focus groups.</p><p id="a6094aa06b5e432e85b00c5dab09d747">Secondary data is data used in a Kaggle competition or a dataset from the popular <link href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php" target="new" internal="false">UCI Machine Learning Repository</link>.
