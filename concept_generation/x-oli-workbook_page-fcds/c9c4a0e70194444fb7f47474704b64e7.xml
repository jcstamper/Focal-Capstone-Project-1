The college would like to use predictive modeling to achieve this objective. The predictive model should provide insights that can inform business processes related to recruitment and retention.</p><p id="fbe01115b5cc4298b21a7f39aacd7e42">Upon meeting with project sponsors, assessing the client for data science readiness, and defining business and analytic objectives, the project team embarks on gathering requirements for this project. The business analyst (BA) identifies all necessary stakeholders and systems related to recruitment and retention in the college. The BA takes the lead in eliciting information about user needs and system constraints. In this scenario, requirements elicitation involves interviewing stakeholders and document analysis. Once user and system requirements are defined, it is time for the project team to define the requirements for the analytic solution. </p><p id="f08a263de82e49d1b48dbd9705381ee8"><em>Data Requirements</em></p><p id="ad8c5ace1b764764a0d16dd87710e48b">While distilling analytic objectives for this project, the project team determined that exploratory analysis of their prospective student data is needed to perform segmentation for targeted advertising and recruitment efforts. Prior to performing a segmentation task or cluster analysis, let us define the requirements for the data that will be explored.</p><p id="a3128326268d4a8999dd7ae853ebb28c">Defining data requirements involves understanding the data needed to reach the business and analytic objectives. Defining the data requirements will involve considerations for data sources, data management, and data extraction. The following questions must be answered to determine the data requirements:</p><ul id="aca9adffaec34c7f9280676bf4261ac2"><li><p id="c7c0f2271c9a4e46b12b99e93670d894">How can data be used to meet the business and analytic objectives?</p></li><li><p id="a749f276e69946e995f910601d91efba">What data is needed for developing the analytic solution? Can the data be collected from credible sources?</p></li><li><p id="ad03b74079ce4b8199eac0cb1ec0f409">How can the data be prepared to visualize and answer relevant questions?</p></li></ul><p id="e2ef3fa2feca48f79420c41f53e9d3fe"><em>Model Requirements</em></p><p id="fdbc9a8d6883465c91d215ccd5e411ef">Although the talent for developing models resides within the project team, the model requirements are defined collaboratively. Model explainability is important to ensure that a client understands the insights that can be gleaned from the results/outputs from the model(s). Letâ€™s consider the scenario above, the client will benefit from models that predict the probability of a prospective applicant enrolling in the college. Without understanding the output of a predictive model, the client is not able to decipher the observations that could have a positive yield from their engagement efforts. This can result in the college wasting funds in targeting prospective students, therefore leading to a failed solution. </p><p id="be434008467e4db1a1c89800756a988a">Model requirements describe the behavior and attributes of a model. The figure below highlights questions that should be answered defining requirements for a model/models:</p><image id="e2f858a6fa4342649f883acf9b5f1b12" src="../webcontent/Analytic_Models.jpg" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="329" width="800"><caption><p id="aa5a9ec1417e4fd696a107646a10939e">Figure 5: Defining Model Requirements</p></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="cc131721b55e486799f7f065fe4d64c0"><em style="italic"><em>Reports and Dashboards: </em></em><em style="italic">&quot;Reports are often considered as a solution for business intelligence projects. If the college needs to generate reports, the project team will work with the college to define the requirements for reports by inquiring about (1) the current reports used in the college and the changes that need to be made to the reports, (2) data sources for the reports, (3) considerations for users generating reports i.e. how can an authorized user customize a report to display the data they need?&quot;. </em></p><p id="b128c2dcbcc44deaa2534e24b1c32b25">Similar to traditional IT projects, requirements should also be gathered for analytic solutions that are packaged. i.e. not developed in-house or outsourced.</p><p id="a5b88b26121d496ab6f4d9e53947c65a">Reading: <link href="https://industrial-ai.skf.com/machine-learning-due-diligence/" target="new" internal="false">Requirements for an IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) Predictive Maintenance Solution.</link></p><wb:inline idref="newfd0786b763c74d57b5ba9c67e8a8585f" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
