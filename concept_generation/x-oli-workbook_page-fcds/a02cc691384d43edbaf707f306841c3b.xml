Throughout the process of discovery and solution development, a data scientist must find it most useful and efficient to focus on developing algorithms and building the models that will support the analytic solution for the business need. This unit sheds light on a crucial phase of the data science project lifecycle that will inform the solution development. </p><p id="b2a52b950a294a58a62374d96d7624f6">Previously, you learned about understanding the business by defining a business problem, setting business and analytic objectives, and gathering requirements. Going forward, you will learn about the next phase in the data science project lifecycle, <em style="italic">Data Understanding</em>. The data understanding phase involves data acquisition and data preparation. Data acquisition involves gathering data from different sources and transforming the data into formats that are suitable for analytic solution development. As a data scientist, you will spend more than 70% of your time understanding, exploring, and transforming the data used for model building. This is important because the quality of your data has a direct impact on the quality of your analytic solution. Through your readings and discussions outside of this course, you will hear data professionals say &quot;<em style="italic">Garbage Data In-Garbage Decisions Out&quot;. </em>You want to pay close attention to the data that is used to develop your analytic solution. </p><p id="cf5a41ae829f40ecb18912e502d38717"><em>Data Gathering Overview</em></p><p id="c0a25515a1d745d68f0ecd238303393f">Now that the requirements phase is completed, the data science team will embark on data acquisition or data gathering. In this unit, we will describe the data gathering process to include data management considerations and its implications on the quality of data, data collection processes and tools, and the data wrangling pipeline. Although the data science project team might not be able to control the data management operations of their data sources, understanding the principles of data management will assist the team in gathering data that is reliable, valid, and has integrity. Even the most secure and reliable data needs to be transformed into a format that can be used to develop analytic solutions. This transformation process happens in various stages of the data gathering and processing phase. A popular term that is referenced in the data transformation process is <em style="italic">Data Wrangling</em>. This is the process of gathering, selecting, and transforming data to ensure that it is usable, free of noise and has as little bias as possible to meet defined analytic objectives. This process will include checking for missing values, identifying outliers, and formatting the data. </p><p id="eb30d31bbf8b4c448630e08117ff4123">Once the data is “wrangled”, the data science project team will continue to work with the data until it is ready to be used. </p><p id="f6040c96c344409e8adb22e89a8da2c7" /><quote><em>Useful Skill: </em>Prior to using APIs and web scraping tools to pull data from different sources. It is important to learn about the importance of quality data and how it can help you meet business and analytic objectives.</quote><p id="c6958960cbe44d5182b5b66bc8a75ed8"><em>Data Management </em></p><p id="d72f69ee36014d42b8861c3cb2dc4d1b">You might be wondering if it is not enough to begin working on that analytic solution now that you have defined your objectives. Now that the project team has defined a data statement, set analytic objectives and gathered requirements. What more do you need to do to start modeling!</p><p id="c3b8f8b81e8a49b1b0844d41b50610f4">Prematurely moving past the data understanding phase will result in bad results for your client. If your team does not understand data quality and how it affects your solution, your solution will be incomplete. Data management supports the data science process by making sure that the data housed within an organization is accessible and accurate. Data management is a strategic initiative, it is an organization’s way of acquiring, storing, securing and processing data. </p><p id="c0d0032ea7e34299b314ff647b2ff254">The data management structure is managed by the IT team in an organization. However, business users will participate in this initiative as well. Data management is such an important aspect of a business that over 100 data management practitioners compiled a best practices framework to guide organizations on managing their data and information infrastructure. The data management body of knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK) highlights eleven knowledge areas as shown in the figure below. These knowledge areas are instrumental to the success of an organization’s data infrastructure.</p><image id="a2fb97ea979c450db6722b752e3a471f" src="../webcontent/Data_Management_Knowledge_AREAS_(1).jpg" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="803" width="500"><caption><p id="f670403ed1f64f4280f99b45e0f3e4a0">The Eleven Knowledge Areas of Data Management</p></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="e301566e56d04afd862a2d113d2858cc">Referencing the figure above, you will note that there are different skill sets and departments involved in the data management process. The data management process is not entirely a data science task.It is a data infrastructure task. Data management informs the data gathering process and can influence the implementation of analytic solutions. The data architects in an organization are responsible for designing the organization&apos;s data management framework. This framework will assist the data science team and other data stakeholders in the organization to use data based on defined policies and regulations to meet business and analytic objectives. </p><p id="ffd4c7a08ac44c5697f75eb4f02881cf" /><table id="fe95690ce0f440f1a370e3ba02d7b84a" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="i5c92a8da85e84752a0949f9609c6270c" /><caption><p id="a6e6b8053d174bd89e90e9033d96ac11" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ac45870f56cd4e3e99e8e0993ea41a48"><em>Data Governance</em> – planning, oversight, and control over management of data and the use of data and data-related resources.
