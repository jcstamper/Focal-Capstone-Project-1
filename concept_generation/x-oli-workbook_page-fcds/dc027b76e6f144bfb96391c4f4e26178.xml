It is a burgeoning field, currently attracting substantial demand from industry, government, and academia. The use of data analysis for real world problems dates to the first census taking efforts during the construction of the pyramids in ancient Egypt. The result of data collection efforts have since been used by governments for resource planning and allocation, and taxation. What is nowadays popularly known as <em style="italic">data science</em> is not a new occupation. This field has evolved from the early 1960s. You will find that the evolution of this field depends on many factors, including access to data.</p><p id="a637d94a70254aa68ddc565ad4a4f944">Interest in developing statistical and programming skills has heightened, and the amount of freely accessible data has skyrocketed. The National Science Board advocated for the recognition of Data Science as a career path in the early 2000s. The explosion of free and ubiquitous data presented an opportunity for companies to gain competitive edge using modeling and quantitative analysis. In 2009, Google’s Hal Varian made a call to the industry for qualified individuals that could “understand data and extract value from it”. The field of <em style="italic">data science </em>will continue to evolve and, as we have seen, it will become more interdisciplinary.  </p><p id="ffd1ab7789694e4dabda2bd31e2e3f1a"><em>Moving Forward</em></p><p id="b8c8cc9896d645f9a62f21552338979a">A Data Scientist should have the skills of a programmer, the quantitative prowess of a statistician, and the ability to extract and communicate insights from the data to domain experts. A successful Data Scientist knows how to work with an organization to define business objectives and support their clients in developing efficient analytical solutions; those solutions will help companies make strategic decisions and use that knowledge to their competitive advantage.</p><p id="cb0cdae5c0124965b63030369407231c">This course will prepare you to successfully approach the core courses in the Masters of Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
