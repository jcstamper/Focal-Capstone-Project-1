This business objective will lead to the development of a mobile application for customer service management. <em style="italic">Business requirements</em> for the above scenario will include describing the context, scope, and background of the business need, including reasons for the proposed change. Business requirements are collected and decomposed to define other types of requirements.</p><p id="ba82b35b75a0455ab32b76ba4229b3db"><em>System and User Requirements</em></p><p id="e63e99c8515b412c9206f61545711ea3">Once business requirements are defined, stakeholders and systems that support the business requirement(s) are identified. <em style="italic">System requirements</em> are a detailed description of the system and its operational and development constraints; this includes the system software that will support the solution, processing, memory, and other application software considerations. <em style="italic">User requirements</em> describe functions or tasks that a user must perform within the system. These tasks will support the business objectives that are defined prior to the requirements gathering process.</p><p id="b3dd07b91d784c56b8912a5b0cbc4b58">Use cases and user stories represent user requirements and provide a big picture of what the user will be able to do within a system. An example of a use case is “Make Payment” on a mobile application. We will describe user and system requirements later in this unit.</p><p id="d3ca7a35a3fe4a88bd401bb1877b293c"><em>Solution Requirements</em></p><p id="a969905ec594427a8f3b6c1b7f73e381"><em style="italic">Solution requirements</em> are grounded in software engineering, in this course, we will be tailoring solution requirements to the data science process. The solution requirements for a data science project are classified into functional, non-functional requirements, as well as requirements that consider parts of an analytic solution that are different from the traditional IT systems. The typical analytic solution will consider data and models (e.g. predictive models), a business intelligence solution will include requirements for reports and dashboards. </p></body></workbook_page>
