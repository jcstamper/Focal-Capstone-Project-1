Communication issues can lead to defects in solutions and unmet expectations. These are issues that a project team should avoid. This can be done by defining requirements in the early stages of solution development. Requirements are well documented statements that define the needs of the users and systems that should be implemented to solve a business need. The requirements gathering process can become complex if it is not managed properly. This process is managed by the business analyst. </p><p id="a2db5ed7910e4757a7a84eb2a5f74abe">There are different types of requirements including business and solution requirements. Business requirements describe the why behind the implementation of a solution, the  user requirements describe the tasks that users will be able to perform with the system, and the solution requirements specify the behavior of the system and its characteristics.</p><p id="f5ad05e5c8354202974b8f88f8ab4486">Similar to a traditional IT project, it is best practice to collect requirements for analytic projects. The requirements for an analytic project include determining how data, models, and results or outputs of the models will support meeting the analytic and business objectives. </p><p id="f2ac6e75a521412484b546c037d1f0b4">There are techniques that are used to gather requirements including conducting interviews, brainstorming sessions and facilitated workshops, other techniques used in addition to the above listed include document analysis and observations. Once requirements are elicited, they are analyzed and translated into written requirements for understanding. Finally, requirements are validated by the project and client team to signal the commencement of solution development. </p><activity idref="newf196b648ac014788ac7f69e373af1559" purpose="checkpoint" /></body><bib:file><bib:entry id="a033f63d64db40ecb8f7b5614da78d43"><bib:proceedings><bib:title>Non-functional requirements for real world big data systems: an investigation of big data architectures at Facebook, Twitter and Netflix</bib:title><bib:year>2019</bib:year><bib:number></bib:number><bib:organization>ICSOFT 2018-Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Technologies</bib:organization><bib:publisher>IEEE</bib:publisher></bib:proceedings></bib:entry><bib:entry id="be0830e9c2404a7e85c1ff8bc5a9849c"><bib:article><bib:author></bib:author><bib:title>IEEE Guide for Software Requirements Specifications</bib:title><bib:journal> IEEE Std</bib:journal><bib:year>1984</bib:year><bib:volume>830-1984</bib:volume><bib:number>10</bib:number><bib:pages>1-26</bib:pages></bib:article></bib:entry><bib:entry id="e8f9019cfcfd4888ab4d3e0ce3db7e74"><bib:inproceedings><bib:author>Sharma, R &amp; Biswas.
