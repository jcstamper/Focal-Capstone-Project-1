A confusion matrix is a matrix style metric that uses the accuracy, precision, recall and specificity to assess whether data was classified accordingly.</p><p id="e63b8cc7ccd24930bc3f92f040077d8b">F-measure or F1 Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall values for classification tasks, it is also an external evaluation for clustering output (only when class labeled data is available). </p><p id="f1b1ec9db279491281793397e1324be3">The AUC-ROC is a common metric used for classification problems. The ROC is a visualization of the sensitivity and specificity. It can be used for both class and probability outputs.  The AUC ROC does not account for the order of probabilities or the model&apos;s ability to predict higher probability for data.</p></li><li><p id="e45d446bc8dc45839a8ab3f9d8f85cb3">Regression problems are evaluated using the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) among others and it is considered the most popular evaluation metric used for regression problems. When the RMSE decreases, it means the model&apos;s performance will improve. </p></li><li><p id="b958b7aaaefa4a159bc7ec799de40b1e">Unsupervised learning algorithms are not as straightforward as the supervised learning algorithms to evaluate. The Dunn index, Silhouette coefficient, and Jaccard&apos;s index are used to evaluate clustering techniques. </p></li></ul><p id="e51198f90f534537934a180fe2979a83">Proceed to Module 15 and complete <em>quiz 10!</em></p></body></workbook_page>
