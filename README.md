# Focal-Captsone-Project
As education continually trends toward online learning, giving students frequent assessments, both formative and summative, is crucial to their development.\cite{zhao2005makes} These assessments often come at a high price to educators however, as they are forced to create a large bank of questions to provide realistic learning opportunities for students of varied skill levels. In addition to the high cost to produce these assessments, educators likewise must spend a significant amount of time providing students with quality feedback. This feedback helps to ensure the assessments that students are completing enrich their learning experience, but is time consuming to produce. Focal is intended to reduce the burden of these assessments on educators. By automating the assessment creation and evaluation pipeline, educators' time will be freed to focus on their various other responsibilities. 

As Focal is a product that is intended to ease the burden of assessments on educators, it is vital that it not only shortens the time necessary to create and evaluate questions, but that it does so accurately. Minimal input from domain experts is a primary goal, meaning that the questions generated should be pedagogically sound without the need for additional input.
