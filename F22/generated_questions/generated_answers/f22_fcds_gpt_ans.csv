This kind of matrix data format is typically used as input to recommendation algorithms, which attempt to predict missing data based on present data (e.g., predict a users rating of a movie they havent rated, based on their past ratings of other movies). A standard technique for performing such predictions is collaborative filtering, which attempts to approximate the original user-movie rating matrix \\( X \\in R^{m \\times n} \\) as a product of two lower-ranked matrices U and V, i.e., \\( X \\approx U V \\) where \\( U \\in R^{m \\times k}, V \\in R^{k \\times n} \\) and \\( k \\ll m, n \\). This factorization involves complex computations over the rows and columns of X, which motivate the need to store X in a sparse format. Q: The matrix data format is used as input to what? A: recommendation algorithms"

Auditing has been used in social science research as an experimental test to discover if a system is doing what it was intended to do and whether it results in desirable or undesirable consequences. Auditing in social science was developed in the 1970s by economists at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate racial discrimination in housing. The experiment involved sending two people, one black and one white, to apply for the same apartment at the same time, and seeing whether the landlord gave the two applicants different answers. They repeated this process many times. If the results showed that there was a pattern of landlords responding in favor of one group over the other, then this could be considered evidence of racial discrimination.",Auditing has been used in social science research to discover if a system is doing what?,"Another component of accountability in data science is auditing.

Collecting and Understanding Data,Ethics of Data Science,Informed Consent,,"Begun in 1932, a study conducted by the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) at Tuskegee University and funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), investigated the cause and development of untreated latent syphilis.

Collecting and Understanding Data,Ethics of Data Science,Informed Consent,,"By the 1950s, when it became clear that penicillin, an antibiotic drug, was a safe and effective treatment for syphilis, the subjects were either prevented from knowing about it or denied such treatment. No subjects were treated with penicillin. The study continued until 1972, when the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) terminated the experiment after accounts of the study appeared in the national press, driven by some whistleblowers. At that time, 74 of the test subjects were still alive. An investigatory panel appointed by HEW in August 1972 found the harm being done by the study was cethically unjustifiedd and stated that penicillin should have been used to treat the men. As a result, the National Research Act mandated that all federally funded proposed research with human subjects be approved by an institutional review board (IRB). The IRBs monitor a process called informed consent. Informed consent states that when a study is being done on a human subject, this individual must be informed about the experiment, must consent to the experiment voluntarily without any coercion, and must have the right to withdraw consent at any time.",In what year did the HEW terminate the experiment?,"By the 1950s, when it became clear that penicillin, an antibiotic drug, was a safe and effective treatment for syphilis, the subjects were either prevented from knowing about it or denied such treatment.

Collecting and Understanding Data,Ethics of Data Science,Informed Consent,,"Informed consent is based on the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) as part of the Privacy Act created in 1974. It is important to note that, progressive as it may appear, there are still limitations to the principle of informed consent. Informed consent was developed in the context of research that would be conducted on human subjects to collect data prospectively. In todays data science practices and applications, informed is usually something that is hidden in numerous pages of fine print, and users are required to say cI acceptd before the process can begin. From an ethical point of view, setting aside the law, there is a consensus that claiming that somebody has been informed because they were given many pages of fine print to read without an actual opportunity to read them is an unethical means of obtaining consent. The concept of voluntary is also questionable, as consent is being obtained precisely when a user already intends to use a service or technology. Users, in these cases, are typically not given the information well in advance, providing them with adequate time to understand the risks or terms prior to consenting.",Consent is based on what principles?,"Informed consent is based on the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) as part of the Privacy Act created in 1974.
