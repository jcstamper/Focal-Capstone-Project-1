1617,1620,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Module Summary and Quiz,,"Some substances form crystalline solids consisting of particles in a very organized                structure; others form amorphous (noncrystalline) solids with an internal structure that                is not ordered. The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids,                covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of                crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the                arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them.                Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have                distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of                interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures.",How do amorphous solids melt?,1,1

1697,1700,Solutions,Solubility,Electrolytes,,"Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to                    water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water                    molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they                    attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water                    molecules penetrate between individual K+ and Cl ions and                    surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together                    and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as seen in the                    illustration below.

There is an            O=O double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this            picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, O2 is not            magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields.

As can be seen in diagrams below, the            wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured            in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an            enormous range - wavelengths of kilometers (103 m) to picometers            (10-12 m) have been observed. The frequency (the rate of oscillation) is the number of wave cycles            that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system,            time is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit            for frequency, expressed as cycles per second (s), is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples            of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = \\(1\^6\\) Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = \\(1\^9\\)            Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave\'s            displacement and so, as shown in the figure below, this corresponds to one-half the height between the            peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for            light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.

3161,3179,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.",What is the number of atomic orbitals combined equal to the original p orbital?,1,0

French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely            regarded as the cfather of modern chemistry,d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, cIt took the mob only a moment            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.",When did Antoine Lavoisier die?,1,0

A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from                    the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a                    vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer                    than a yard (Figure); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer                    distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 103 m),                    whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m =                        10-2 m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10-3 m).",What is a meter defined as?,1,0
