Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent            basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful            bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various            chemical compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of            calcium ion, Ca2+, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent            eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium            levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that            also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of Ca2+ in            the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium            level.

The principal                    quantum number, n, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of                    energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus                    are related to n. Orbitals having the same value of n are said to be in the same                    shell. The angular momentum quantum number, l, can have any integer value from 0                    to n  1. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital.                    Orbitals with the same principle quantum number and the same l value belong to                    the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml, with 2l + 1 values ranging                    from l to +l, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition,                    each electron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can be equal to .

For the transition                        metals, electrons are removed from the s orbital first and then from the d                        orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p orbitals                        and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have                        a charge of 2+, and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital.                        Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons and then                        its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron                        configurations of the ions:",When is Chromium a transition element?,1

The law of multiple proportionswhen two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers states                    that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one                    element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole                    numbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid                    with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown                    crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These                    ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative;                    however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly                    surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.","What can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper?",1

Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat            transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated            object (calorimeterdevice used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter            is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to            establish the calorimeters heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach            requires the definition of a systemportion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical            or physical change) and its surroundingsall matter other than the system being studied (the other components of the measurement            apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the            system).

4326,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ion Formation,,"Note the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge.

4687,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Colligative Properties of Electrolytes,,"In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich H\xbcckel proposed a theory to explain the            apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although            interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the            ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The            residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles.          In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a            solvated unit called an ion pair.

A solution may be saturated with the compound at an            elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a            lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains            solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower            temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the            excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal or by mechanically agitating the            solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one pictured in Figure, take advantage of this            behavior.",How can precipitation of excess solute be initiated?,1
