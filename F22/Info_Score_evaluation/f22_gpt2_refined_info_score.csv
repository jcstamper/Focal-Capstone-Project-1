Exemplar theory states that people store the attributes of observed examples, called exemplars, along with their category labels in memory, and categorize a new object with the label of the most similar exemplar. For example, people would categorize an object as a bird if its similar to any type of bird that they have come across, e.g., parrot, sparrow, penguin. In contrast, prototype theory states that there is a central representation of each category, and people compare a new object against these central tendencies to determine its category. With the same bird classification task above, based on the prototype theory, one would label an object as a bird if it possesses the common, caveraged features of a bird, e.g., two legs, two wings, and lay eggs.

Auditing in social science was developed in the 1970s by economists at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to investigate racial discrimination in housing. The experiment involved sending two people, one black and one white, to apply for the same apartment at the same time, and seeing whether the landlord gave the two applicants different answers.
