If the metal can form ions                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and                        FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule                    of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and                        N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the ide suffix to ic,                    and adding cacid;d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the                    ending of the anion to ic, and adding cacid;d H2CO3 is                    carbonic acid.",What do chemists use to clearly name compounds?,"['metal', 'polyatomic', 'compound', 'binary', 'molecular', 'dinitrogen', 'numeral', 'FeCl2', 'nonmetal', 'ending', 'consist', 'contain', 'common', 'acid', 'hydrogen', 'special', 'oxyacid', 'ionic', 'memorize', 'add', 'prefix', 'name', 'molecule', 'hydrochloric', 'chemist', 'specify', 'iron(II', 'carbonic', 'class', 'important', 'different', 'ide', 'parenthesis', 'atom', 'sulfur', 'example', 'include', 'number', 'HCl', 'have', 'potassium', 'suffix', 'nomenclature', 'charge', 'element', 'ratio', 'method', 'chloride', 'anion', 'follow', 'use', 'form', 'roman', 'N2O4', 'rule', 'oxide', 'change', 'write', 'hydro-', 'call', 'ic', 'ion', 'iron(iii']",0.0

165,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Energy and Phase Changes,,"Consider the extent to which intermolecular attractions must be overcome to                    achieve a given phase transition. Converting a solid into a liquid requires that                    these attractions be only partially overcome; transition to the gaseous state                    requires that they be completely overcome. As a result, the enthalpy of fusion                    for a substance is less than its enthalpy of vaporization. This same logic can                    be used to derive an approximate relation between the enthalpies of all phase                    changes for a given substance.

Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to besimilar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference patternto form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their cslits,dsince the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same asthe de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. In the image below,part a shows an interference pattern. The waveparticle duality of matter can beseen in diagrams below by observing what happens if electron collisions arerecorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons havebeen recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in smalllocalized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrivedand were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelikebehavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localizedparticles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied byclassical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equationthat governs a probability distribution even for a single electrons motion.Thus the waveparticle duality first observed with photons is actually afundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.",What is the hallmark of wavelikebehavior?,"['emerge', 'small', 'packet', 'test', 'havebeen', 'interferenceexperiment', 'atom', 'duality', 'atbell', 'slit', 'matter', 'arrive', 'smalllocalize', 'localizedparticle', 'interference', 'form', 'imply', 'probability', 'period', 'appear', 'wavelength', 'size', 'random', 'serve', 'hallmark', 'time', 'crystalline', 'particle', 'electron', 'clear', 'behavior', 'collision', 'nature', 'happen', 'afundamental', 'photon', 'travel', 'diagram', 'equation', 'long', 'follow', 'record', 'propose', 'space', 'beseen', 'lattice', 'target', 'exhibit', 'image', 'motion', 'show', 'pattern', 'equationthat', 'besimilar', 'arerecorde', 'byclassical', 'type', 'demonstrate', 'govern', 'waveparticle', 'crystal', 'quantum', 'wavelike', 'like', 'observe', 'intrinsic', 'distribution', 'scientist', 'atomic', 'nickel', 'regular', 'cslit', 'need', 'single', 'layer', 'spacing', 'wave', 'mechanic']",0.0

It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on            either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that            the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of            any formula containing that element by the elements subscript in the formula.

Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy                  input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated,                  but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies                  formation of the solution.",What is a solution that absorbs heat from the surroundings of a solute?,"['pack', 'accompany', 'plastic', 'compound', 'small', 'solvate', 'dissolve', 'thin', 'dissolution', 'wall', 'area', 'separate', 'input', 'injure', 'formation', 'example', 'process', 'endothermic', 'seal', 'release', 'injury', 'exothermic', 'decrease', 'solution', 'cold', 'nh4no3', 'recover', 'surrounding', 'soluble', 'NH4NO3', 'spontaneous', 'heat', 'instant', 'apply', 'swell', 'break', 'favor', 'large', 'water', 'require', 'form', 'compress', 'great', 'solid', 'ammonium', 'increase', 'treat', 'energy', 'disorder', 'guarantee', 'note', 'provide', 'bag', 'species', 'solute', 'absorb']",2.333333333333333

1258,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,Introduction to Chemistry,,"Chemistry is sometimes referred to as cthe central scienced due to its                    interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for                    areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).                    Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine,                    materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields.                  The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many                    aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines                    within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry.                    Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools                    that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the                    chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial                    to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living                    organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and                    nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce                    useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics.

It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone            pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal            electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in            diagram below: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two            axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial            position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). The axial            position is surrounded by bond angles of 90, whereas the equatorial position has more            space available because of the 120 bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair            geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious            positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs.

1493,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Quantum Mechanics,,"Like de Broglie, Schrdinger initially viewed the electron in hydrogen as being a                    physical wave instead of a particle, but where de Broglie thought of the                    electron in terms of circular stationary waves, Schrdinger properly thought in                    terms of three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by                    the Greek letter psi, .

1551,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Types of Crystalline Solids,,"Metallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by                    metal atoms. The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform                    distribution of atomic nuclei within a csead of delocalized electrons. The atoms                    within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as                    metallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All                    exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and                    malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability                    (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and,                    therefore, make useful construction materials.

Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when            they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other).

All of the water in the container is now                    present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of                    the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and                    the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point                    . Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much                    pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature                    is called the critical pressure.

3162,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,The Spin Quantum Number,,"An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l,                        ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the                    orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property                    called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle                    that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general                    behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated                    as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of                    all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the                    same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but                    only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values.

When the electron is in this lowest energy            orbit, the atom is said to be in its ground electronic statestate in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible (or simply ground state). If the            atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to            an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic statestate having an energy greater than the ground-state energy (or            simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an            excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the            difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an            atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more            excited one.","When an electron transitions from an excited state to a less excited state, the difference in energy is emitted as what?","['stable', 'law', 'difference', 'source', 'hydrogen', 'grind', 'electron', 'transition', 'molecule', 'physics', 'atom', 'receive', 'have', 'state', 'value', 'fundamental', 'statestate', 'photon', 'matter', 'excited', 'ground', 'low', 'n', 'great', 'possible', 'energy', 'orbit', 'say', 'emit', 'move', 'outside', 'ion', 'high', 'absorb', 'electronic']",0.6842105263157894

The sample is placed in the bomb, which is                    then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to                    ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is trapped in the steel                    bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along                    with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy                    produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the                    heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. Once the heat                    capacity of the bomb calorimeter is determined, this is taken into consideration                    in the calculation for qreaction.",When is the sample placed in the bomb filled with oxygen?,"['small', 'occur', 'bomb', 'qreaction', 'trap', 'reaction', 'describe', 'different', 'process', 'calculation', 'vigorous', 'heat', 'sample', 'steel', 'yield', 'calorimeterdevice', 'large', 'solid', 'explosion', 'produce', 'flow', 'accompany', 'capacity', 'accurate', 'submerge', 'surround', 'involve', 'temperature', 'convenient', 'spark', 'operate', 'pressure', 'ignite', 'ensure', 'product', 'damage', 'increase', 'gaseous', 'result', 'calculate', 'contain', 'resemble', 'observation', 'image', 'container', 'fill', 'robust', 'oxygen', 'solution', 'electrical', 'see', 'amount', 'water', 'change', 'energy', 'term', 'calibration', 'design', 'type', 'condition', 'combustion', 'consist', 'cbombd', 'place', 'take', 'calorimeter', 'reactant', 'volume', 'come', 'require', 'constant', 'know', 'consideration', 'measure', 'atmospheric', 'determine', 'high']",0.0

3728,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Energy of Orbitals,,"The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, n, increases. In            any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies            of subshells with different values of l differ so that the energy of the orbitals            increases within a shell in the order s < p < d < f. The diagram below, which            we saw previously, depicts how these two trends in increasing energy relate. The 1s            orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy.

4989,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Module Summary and Quiz,,"Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called                    the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An                    aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a                    solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of                    solution.
