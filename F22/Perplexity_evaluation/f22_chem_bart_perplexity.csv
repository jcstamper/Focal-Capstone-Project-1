0,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Introduction,Introduction to Composition of Substances and Solutions,"Swimming pools have long been a popular means of recreation, exercise, and physical            therapy. Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent            basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful            bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various            chemical compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of            calcium ion, Ca2+, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent            eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium            levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that            also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of Ca2+ in            the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium            level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances (such as the            calcium-containing compound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of            this unit.",,what should be kept in the pool according to the text?,90.21105194091797
1,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Introduction,Introduction to Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,"It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including            graphite and diamonds. But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was            recognized: buckminsterfullerene, commonly known as a cbuckyball.d This molecule was            named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895), whose            signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell            structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C            60 , and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable            molecule. They were guided by bonding theorythe topic of this unitwhich explains            how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.

2,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Introduction,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties Introduction,"            The Crab Nebula consists of remnants of a supernova (the explosion of a                star). NASAs Hubble Space Telescope produced this composite image. Measurements                of the emitted light wavelengths enabled astronomers to identify the elements in                the nebula, determining that it contains specific ions including S+ (green                filaments) and O2+ (red filaments). (credit: modification of work by NASA and                ESA)
In 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of a cguest stard in the sky,            visible even during the day, which then disappeared slowly over the next two years. The            sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the            original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the            remaining Crab Nebula continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light            but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The            nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra            (the colored filaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of            electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms.            We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from            thousands of light years away.",,how did the scientists determine the elements in the nebula?,63.73823928833008
3,Gases,Introduction,Introduction to Gases,"We are surrounded by an ocean of gasthe atmosphereand many of the properties of gases            are familiar to us from our daily activities. Heated gases expand, which can make a hot            air balloon rise or cause a blowout in a bicycle tire left in the sun on a hot day.
Gases have played an important part in the development of chemistry. In the seventeenth            and eighteenth centuries, many scientists investigated gas behavior, providing the first            mathematical descriptions of the behavior of matter.
In this unit, we will examine the relationships between gas temperature, pressure,            amount, and volume. We will study a simple theoretical model and use it to analyze the            experimental behavior of gases. The results of these analyses will show us the            limitations of the theory and how to improve on it.",,what's the relationship between gases and air balloon?,187.3984832763672
4,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Introduction,Introduction to Chemical Reactions and Stoichiometry,"Solid-fuel rockets are a central feature in the worlds space exploration programs,            including the new Space Launch System being developed by the National Aeronautics and            Space Administration (NASA) to replace the retired Space Shuttle fleet. The engines of            these rockets rely on carefully prepared solid mixtures of chemicals combined in            precisely measured amounts. Igniting the mixture initiates a vigorous chemical reaction            that rapidly generates large amounts of gaseous products. These gases are ejected from            the rocket engine through its nozzle, providing the thrust needed to propel heavy            payloads into space. Both the nature of this chemical reaction and the relationships            between the amounts of the substances being consumed and produced by the reaction are            critically important considerations that determine the success of the technology. This            unit will describe how to symbolize chemical reactions using chemical equations, how to            classify some common chemical reactions by identifying patterns of reactivity, and how            to determine the quantitative relations between the amounts of substances involved in            chemical reactionsthat is, the reaction stoichiometry.

5,Solids and Liquids,Introduction,Introduction,"The great distances between atoms and molecules in a gaseous phase, and the corresponding            absence of any significant interactions between them, allows for simple descriptions of            many physical properties that are the same for all gases, regardless of their chemical            identities. As described in the final module on gases, this situation            changes at high pressures and low temperaturesconditions that permit the atoms and            molecules to interact to a much greater extent. In the liquid and solid states, these            interactions are of considerable strength and play an important role in determining a            number of physical properties that do depend on the chemical identity of the substance.            In this unit, the nature of these interactions and their effects on various physical            properties of liquid and solid phases will be examined.",,what is the final module on gases described in the text?,225.6806182861328
6,Solutions,Introduction,Introduction to Solutions,"Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine species. They are being threatened by            climate change, oceanic acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the            composition of the solution we know as seawater. Dissolved oxygen in seawater is            critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the            concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon            dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are            particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the            coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of            seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to            affect our oceans.
Solutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes            involving chemical reactions. In this chapter, we will consider the nature of solutions,            and examine factors that determine whether a solution will form and what properties it            may have. In addition, we will discuss colloidssystems that resemble solutions but            consist of dispersions of particles somewhat larger than ordinary molecules or ions.

7,Thermochemistry,Introduction,Introduction to Thermochemistry,"Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in            energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function            without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about 85% of US energy            consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We            use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw materials,            manufactured goods, and people (27%); for industrial production (21%); and to heat and            power our homes and businesses (10%). While these combustion reactions help us meet our            essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific            community as a major contributor to global climate change.
Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than            combustion. For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or            flashlight results from chemical reactions. This unit introduces many of the basic            ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with a            focus on thermal energy.

8,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Molecular Compounds,"Many compounds do not contain ions but instead consist solely of discrete, neutral            molecules. These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share,            rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and            extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail later in            this course. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical            properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases,            low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions            exist.
Whereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent            compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can            help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the            positions of a compounds elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic            or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a            very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.            Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and youll learn more about            those later.
The bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from                    ionic compounds, and they are named using a different system as well. The                    charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so                    specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine                    chemical formulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant                    variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for                    molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.
When two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination                    ratios are often possible. For example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds                    CO and CO2. Since these are different substances with different                    properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called                    carbon oxide). To deal with this situation, we use a naming method that is                    somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to                    specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic                    element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is                    first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to                    the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix ide. The numbers of                    atoms of each element are designated by the Greek prefixes shown in the table                    below.
When only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- is usually                    deleted from that part. Thus, CO is named carbon monoxide, and CO2 is                    called carbon dioxide. When two vowels are adjacent, the ""a"" in the Greek prefix                    is usually dropped. Some other examples are shown in table below.
There are a few common names that you will encounter as you continue your study                    of chemistry. For example, although NO is often called nitric oxide, its proper                    name is nitrogen monoxide. Similarly, N2O is known as nitrous oxide even though                    our rules would specify the name dinitrogen monoxide. (And H2O is usually called                    water, not dihydrogen monoxide.) You should commit to memory the common names of                    compounds as you encounter them.

9,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"Macroscopic objects act as particles. Microscopic objects (such as electrons)                    have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot                    be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the                    three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according                    to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as . Atomic                    wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the                    wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the                    electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe                    the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.
An atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal                    quantum number, n, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of                    energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus                    are related to n. Orbitals having the same value of n are said to be in the same                    shell. The angular momentum quantum number, l, can have any integer value from 0                    to n  1. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital.                    Orbitals with the same principle quantum number and the same l value belong to                    the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml, with 2l + 1 values ranging                    from l to +l, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition,                    each electron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can be equal to . No two                    electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four                    quantum numbers.
The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals                    are filled (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, and so on). Electron configurations                    and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle                    (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hunds rule                    (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).
Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible                    for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements                    with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same                    group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly                    when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table                    can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last                    electron to be added is placed: main group elements (s and p orbitals),                    transition elements (d orbitals), and inner transition elements (f                    orbitals).

10,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Module Summary and Quiz,"Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry.                Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be                represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use the SI (International System)                or metric systems. We use base SI units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units,                such as liters (for volume) and g/cm3 (for density). In many cases, we find it convenient to use unit prefixes                that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10-6 seconds) and megahertz (106 hertz),                respectively.
Quantities can be exact or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number                of significant figures in the measurement. The uncertainty of a calculated value depends on the uncertainties in                the values used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Measured values can be accurate                (close to the true value) and/or precise (showing little variation when measured repeatedly).
Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured                quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors,                which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or                dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured                quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.

11,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Acids,"Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known            as acidssubstances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water. The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail later in this            course, but for now, it will suffice to note that many acids release hydrogen ions,                H+, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a            mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compounds name.
substances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water
If the compound is a binary acidcompound containing two different elements (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic                    element) use the steps below to name the acid.
compound containing two different elements
For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the                    solution is called hydrochloric acid. Several other examples of this                    nomenclature are shown in table below.
Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or                    coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you                    will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known                    as oxyacidscompound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water), compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other                    element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the                    compound (you will learn the details of this later in this course). Typical                    oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion.                    To name oxyacids follow the steps below.
compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water)
For example, consider H2CO3 (which you might be tempted to                    call chydrogen carbonated). To name this correctly, chydrogend is omitted; the                    ate of carbonate is replace with ic; and acid is addedso its name is carbonic                    acid. Other examples are given in Table. There are some exceptions to the                    general naming method (e.g., H2SO4 is called sulfuric                    acid, not sulfic acid, and H2SO3 is sulfurous, not                    sulfous, acid).

13,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Module Summary and Quiz,"Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass                    numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the                    number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is                    composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the                    average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the                    atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, or two-letter                     abbreviations for the atoms.
A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact                    numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives                    the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula                    indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick                    and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements                    of atoms.
The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements                    led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged                    in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known                    as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar                    chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and                    nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition                    metals. Groups are numbered 1 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are                    known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals;                    those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are                    the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.
Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of                    electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the                    preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged                    ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and,                    to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed                    to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in                    the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively                    charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions.                    Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic                    (containing more than one atom).
Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally                    form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead                    consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms                    that behave as a single unit), are called covalent or molecular compounds. Covalent compounds                    usually form from two nonmetals.
Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular                    compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds                    typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written                    first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to ide. For                    example, K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and                        FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule                    of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and                        N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the ide suffix to ic,                    and adding cacid;d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the                    ending of the anion to ic, and adding cacid;d H2CO3 is                    carbonic acid.

14,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Energy and Phase Changes,"Vaporization is an endothermic process. The cooling effect can be evident when                    you leave a swimming pool or a shower. When the water on your skin evaporates,                    it removes heat from your skin and causes you to feel cold. The energy change                    associated with the vaporization process is the enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap. For example, the vaporization of water                    at standard temperature is represented by:
As described in the unit on thermochemistry, the reverse of an endothermic                    process is exothermic. And so, the condensation of a gas releases heat:
The amount of heat required to change one mole of a substance from the solid                    state to the liquid state is the enthalpy of fusion, \xceHfus of the substance. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.0                    kJ/mol at 0 C. Fusion (melting) is an endothermic process:
The reciprocal process, freezing, is an exothermic process whose enthalpy change                    is .0 kJ/mol at 0 C:
One way our body is cooled is by evaporation of the water in sweat. In very hot                climates, we can lose as much as 1.5 L of sweat per day. Although sweat is not pure                water, we can get an approximate value of the amount of heat removed by evaporation                by assuming that it is. How much heat is required to evaporate 1.5 L of water (1.5                kg) at T = 37 C (normal body temperature); \xceHvap                = 43.46 kJ/mol at 37 C.
We start with the known volume of sweat (approximated as just water) and use the                given information to convert to the amount of heat needed:
Thus, 3600 kJ of heat are removed by the evaporation of 1.5 L of water.
Like vaporization, the process of sublimation requires an input of energy to                    overcome intermolecular attractions. The enthalpy of sublimation, \xceHsub, is the energy required to convert one                    mole of a substance from the solid to the gaseous state. For example, the                    sublimation of carbon dioxide is represented by:
Consider the extent to which intermolecular attractions must be overcome to                    achieve a given phase transition. Converting a solid into a liquid requires that                    these attractions be only partially overcome; transition to the gaseous state                    requires that they be completely overcome. As a result, the enthalpy of fusion                    for a substance is less than its enthalpy of vaporization. This same logic can                    be used to derive an approximate relation between the enthalpies of all phase                    changes for a given substance. Though not an entirely accurate description,                    sublimation may be conveniently modeled as a sequential two-step process of                    melting followed by vaporization in order to apply Hesss Law. Viewed in this                    manner, the enthalpy of sublimation for a substance may be estimated as the sum                    of its enthalpies of fusion and vaporization. For example:

15,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions: Moles and Particles,"A balanced chemical equation provides a great deal of information in a very succinct            format. Chemical formulas provide the identities of the reactants and products involved            in the chemical change, allowing classification of the reaction. Coefficients provide            the relative numbers of these chemical species, allowing a quantitative assessment of            the relationships between the amounts of substances consumed and produced by the            reaction. These quantitative relationships are known as the reactions                 stoichiometry                                                            relationships between the amounts of reactants and products of a chemical                            reaction                                                , a term derived from the Greek words stoicheion (meaning celementd) and metron            (meaning cmeasured). In this module, the use of balanced chemical equations for various            stoichiometric applications is explored.
relationships between the amounts of reactants and products of a chemical                            reaction
The general approach to using stoichiometric relationships is similar in concept to the            way people go about many common activities. Food preparation, for example, offers an            appropriate comparison. A recipe for making eight pancakes calls for 1 cup pancake mix,            3/4 cup milk, and one egg. The cequationd representing the preparation of pancakes per            this recipe is
If two dozen pancakes are needed for a big family breakfast, the ingredient amounts must            be increased proportionally according to the amounts given in the recipe. For example,            the number of eggs required to make 24 pancakes is
Balanced chemical equations are used in much the same fashion to determine the amount of            one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant, or to yield a            given amount of product, and so forth. The coefficients in the balanced equation are            used to derive                 stoichiometric factors                                                            ratio of coefficients in a balanced chemical equation, used in                            computations relating amounts of reactants and products                                                 that permit computation of the desired quantity. To illustrate this idea,            consider the production of ammonia by reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen:
ratio of coefficients in a balanced chemical equation, used in                            computations relating amounts of reactants and products
This equation shows ammonia molecules are produced from hydrogen molecules in a 2:3            ratio, and stoichiometric factors may be derived using any amount (number) unit:
These stoichiometric factors can be used to compute the number of ammonia molecules            produced from a given number of hydrogen molecules, or the number of hydrogen molecules            required to produce a given number of ammonia molecules. Similar factors may be derived            for any pair of substances in any chemical equation.
How many moles of I2 are required to react with 0.429 mol of Al according                to the following equation?
Referring to the balanced chemical equation, the stoichiometric factor relating the                two substances of interest is 3 mol I2 mol/ 2 mol Al. The molar amount of                iodine is derived by multiplying the provided molar amount of aluminum by this                factor:
We can also use the stoichiometric relationships in a balanced equation to determine the            number of particles (atoms, molecules, or formula units) involved in a chemical            reaction.
How many carbon dioxide molecules are produced when 0.75 mol of propane is combusted                according to this equation?
The approach here is the same as in the previous example, though the absolute number                of molecules is requested, not the number of moles of molecules. This will simply                require use of the moles-to-numbers conversion factor, Avogadros number.
The balanced equation shows that carbon dioxide is produced from propane in a 3:1                ratio:

16,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Attractive Forces,"As was the case for gaseous substances , the kinetic molecular            theory may be used to explain the behavior of solids and liquids. In the following            description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion.
Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and            gaseous matter:
From everyday experience we know that substances exist in different states of matter            under various conditions. For example, water is a liquid at room temperature, a solid at            tempertures below 0 oC and a gas at temperatures above 100 oC.            Table salt (NaCl) is a solid a room temperature with a very high melting point and            boiling point of 800 oC and 1413 oC, respectively. While nitrogen                (N2), which is the main component in the air all around us, is a gas at            room temperature with a melting point of -210 oC and a boiling point of -196                oC.
The difference in the conditions at which a substace is a solid, liquid, or gas reflect            the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make            up the substance. These attractive forces are either ionic bonds, in the case of ionic            compounds, or intermolecular forces (IMFs), in the case of molecular compounds. IMFs are            the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a            molecular substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module.            The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its attractive            forces and the kinetic energies (KE) of its particles. The attractive forces serve to            hold particles close together, whereas the particles KE provides the energy required to            overcome these forces and thus increase the distance between particles.
Consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is cooled sufficiently, the kinetic energy            of its molecules decreases and the attractions between the molecules will be capable of            holding them together when they come into contact with each other; the gas condenses,            forming liquid H2O. When the liquid water is cooled even more, the kinetic            energy of its molecules decreases further and the attraction between the molecules will            be capable of holding them together in a rigid structure to form solid H2O or            ice.
Different substances have widely varying strengths of attractive forces between their            particles because of their composition. These attractive forces have a direct impact on            boiling points and melting points. In this module, we will explore these attractive            forces and their effects. Note that throughout this module we will focus primarily on            differences in boiling points, but, by and large, the concepts discussed can also be            applied to melting points.

17,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Changes in Enthalpy,"Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to            describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as            the sum of a systems internal energy (E) and the mathematical            product of its pressure (P) and volume (V):
Since it is derived from three state functions (E, P, and V), enthalpy is also a state            function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only            enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes            that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical            changes), the enthalpy change (\xceH) is:
The mathematical product P\xceV represents            work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By            their definitions, the arithmetic signs of \xceV and w will always be opposite:
Substituting this equation into the enthalpy-change equation yields:
From definition of internal energy, \xceE = q + w, we then get:
Where the subscript on heat, qp , is included to            specify that this is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
If a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the                  only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow                  (qp) and enthalpy change (\xceH) for the process are                      equal.
for processes occurring at constant pressure.
The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of            the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially            constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction            measured in a bomb calorimeter, as discussed previously, is not equal to \xceH because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents            expansion work from occurring. Chemists usually perform experiments under normal            atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure where q =                \xceH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for            determining heat.
The following shows how the above conventions apply when we use \xceH for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas: :
When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of                NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat is produced. What is \xceH for the following reaction, corresponding to the enthalpy                change per mole of acid reacting?
For the reaction of 0.0500 mol HCl acid, q = .9 kJ. This                leads us to the ratio                                                                        .9 kJ                            0.0500 mol HCl                                                            Which can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1                mole of HCl reacts:
The enthalpy change when 1 mole of HCl reacts is therefore  kJ. Since in the                chemical equation, one mole of HCl reacts, we write the enthalpy of the reaction as:
The following example illustrates that you need to take both stoichiometry and limiting            reactants into account when determining the \xceH for a chemical            reaction.
A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C12H22O11.                When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO3, 43.7 kJ of heat is                produced. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.
Moles of C12H22O11 available:
Moles of KClO3 available:
Since,
is needed, C12H22O11 is the excess reactant and                    KClO3 is the limiting reactant. Because all of the KClO3 reacts, we                can say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 7.19 g of KClO3 reacts. (Note that we                cannot say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 2.67 g of sucrose reaction, because                not all of the sucrose reacted in this experiment.) [The reaction uses 8 mol                    KClO3, and the conversion factor is,                                                                                                        −                                43.7 kJ                                                                                        0.0587 mol KCl                                                                    O                                    3                                                                                                                        ]
The enthalpy change for this reaction is  kJ, and the thermochemical equation                is:",Reference: The Periodic Table of Elements,"if a process is carried out at constant pressure, what will happen to the enthalpy",48.81770324707031
18,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Chemical Equations,"Previously we introduced the use of element symbols to represent individual atoms. Whenatoms gain or lose electrons to yield ions, or combine with other atoms to formmolecules, their symbols are modified or combined to generate chemical formulas thatappropriately represent these species. Extending this symbolism to represent both theidentities and the relative quantities of substances undergoing a chemical (or physical)change involves writing and balancing a chemical equationsymbolic representation of a chemical reaction. Consider as an example the reaction between one methane molecule(CH4) and two diatomic oxygen molecules (O2) to produce onecarbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two water molecules (H2O).

The relative numbers of reactant and product species are represented by coefficientsnumbers placed in front of symbols or formulas in a chemical equation toindicate their relative amount(numbers placed immediately to the left of each formula). A coefficient of 1is typically omitted.
numbers placed in front of symbols or formulas in a chemical equation toindicate their relative amount
It is common practice to use the smallest possible whole-number coefficients in achemical equation, as is done in this example. Realize, however, that these coefficientsrepresent the relative numbers of reactants and products, and, therefore, they may becorrectly interpreted as ratios. Methane and oxygen react to yield carbon dioxide andwater in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. This ratio is satisfied if the numbers of these molecules are,respectively, 1-2-1-2, or 2-4-2-4, or 3-6-3-6, and so on. Likewise, these coefficientsmay be interpreted with regard to any amount (number) unit, and so this equation may becorrectly read in many ways, including:
One methane molecule and two oxygen molecules react to yield one carbon dioxide moleculeand two water molecules.
One dozen methane molecules and two dozen oxygen molecules react to yield one dozencarbon dioxide molecules and two dozen water molecules.
One mole of methane molecules and 2 moles of oxygen molecules react to yield 1 mole ofcarbon dioxide molecules and 2 moles of water molecules.

19,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Chemical Symbols,"Previously we discussed elements and the periodic table. Elements are represented by a            chemical symbol. A chemical symbol is an abbreviation that we use to indicate an element            or an atom of an element. For example, the symbol for mercury is Hg. We use the same            symbol to indicate one atom of mercury (microscopic domain) or to label a container of            many atoms of the element mercury (macroscopic domain).
The symbols of all elements are listed on the periodic table of elements.
Notice that the atomic number for each element is listed on the periodic table and that            the elements are arranged in order atomic number. We will discuss the periodic table in            more detail later in this course.
During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared                    to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a cnew                    elementd produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the                    name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was                    chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a                    different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other                    elements, led the English chemist Frederick Soddy to realize that an element                    could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically                    indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopesAtoms of the same element that has different masses due to different numbers of neutrons.atoms of the same                    element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in                    1921 for this discovery. Later it was determined that the cause of the different                    masses between isotopes of the same element is different numbers of                    neutrons.
Atoms of the same element that has different masses due to different numbers of neutrons.
The symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass                    number as a superscript to the left of the element symbol. The atomic number is                    sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol, but since this number                    defines the elements identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For                    example, magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic                    number of 12 and with mass numbers of 24, 25, and 26, respectively. These                    isotopes can be identified as 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg. These isotope symbols are                    read as celement, mass numberd and can be symbolized consistent with this                    reading. For instance, 24Mg is read as cmagnesium 24,d and can be written as                    cmagnesium-24d or cMg-24.d 25Mg is read as cmagnesium 25,d and can be written as                    cmagnesium-25d or cMg-25.d All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus.                    They differ only because a 24Mg atom has 12 neutrons in its nucleus, a 25Mg atom                    has 13 neutrons, and a 26Mg has 14 neutrons.

20,Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Solutions,"An earlier unit introduced solutions, defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more            substances. Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater            concentration, in which case it is called the solvent. The other components of the            solution present in relatively lesser concentrations are called solutes. Sugar is a            covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules,            C12H22O11. When this compound dissolves in water, its            molecules become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water:
The caqd in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are            therefore individually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent).            Although sucrose molecules are heavier than water molecules, they remain dispersed            throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to csettle outd over time.
Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is an ionic compound            composed of colorless potassium ions, K+, and orange dichromate ions,                Cr2O72. When a small amount of solid potassium            dichromate is added to water, the compound dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium            ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed throughout the mixture (seen below), as            indicated in this equation:
As with the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its            solutes, potassium and dichromate ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent            (water) molecules.
Water is used so often as a solvent that the word solution has come to imply an aqueous            solution to many people. However, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent.            Many alloys are solid solutions of one metal dissolved in another; for example, US            five-cent coins contain nickel dissolved in copper. Air is a gaseous solution, a            homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and several other gases. Oxygen (a gas),            alcohol (a liquid), and sugar (a solid) all dissolve in water (a liquid) to form liquid            solutions. The table below gives examples of several different solutions and the phases            of the solutes and solvents.

21,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Early Atomic Theory,"The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers,             the scientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was             composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for cindivisible.d             They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later,             Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four celementsdfire,             earth, air, and waterand could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and celementsd             as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.
The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John             Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic             theory. First published in 1807, many of Daltons hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern             atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Daltons atomic theory.
Daltons atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that youve             learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken             down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither             created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one             type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).

22,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Electromagnetic Energy,"Electromagnetic energy is transmitted by waves that have electric and magnetic fields            oscillating perpendicularly from each other and from the direction the wave propagates            or travels, as seen in the animatation below. The electromagnetic spectrum contains waves with a continuous range of            energies, frequencies and wavelengths. There are different classifications for the            electromagnetic waves in the spectrum, many of which you are likely familiar with            including: visible light, cell phone signals, microwaves, X-rays, infrared (IR)            radiation, and gamma rays.
Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation. For example, radio            waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food in your            microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television            screen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.
Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in            chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and            molecules. In this section we will explore the nature of electromagnetic energy, and            in following sections we will see how the theories about electromagnetic energy are used            to help describe the electronic structure of the atom.

23,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Exploring Electron and Molecular Geometry,"Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules.                    However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important                    to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, angles, and                    relative arrangements in space. A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds                    that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or                    bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the                    straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in ngstroms (1                     = 10 m) or picometers (1 pm = 10 m, 100 pm = 1                    ).
Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict                    the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central                    atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron                    pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the                    valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes                    repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them.                    The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs                    of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The                    electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions                    of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as                    possible.
VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom                    and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should                    understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions.                    Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron                    attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a                    particular molecular structure.
As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous                        BeF2 molecule. The Lewis structure of BeF2 shows only                    two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone                    pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible,                    and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density                    is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. The                    bond angle is 180.
In the activity below, you will explore the three dimensional shapes that                    molecules take based on VSEPR theory. In this first activity, we will look at                    electron pair geometries in which the shapes are determined by the total number                    of pairs of electrons surrounding the central atom. Fill in the tables as                    directed.

As you build the different electron geometry shapes in this activity, note                        that you are able to move the shape around to better see the shape in 3                        dimensions.
Return to the ""Molecular Shapes"" simulation or reopen it from the link above.                        If you have reopened the simulation choose the ""Real Molecules"" icon on the                        starting screen. If you still have the simulation open you can toggle to the                        ""Real Molecules"" portion by clicking on the icon at the bottom center of the                        screen as seen in the image below.
When you are in the ""Real Molecules"" part of the simulation, in the ""Name""                        section check ""Electron Geometry"" and in the ""Options"" section check ""Show                        Bond Angles."" Be sure that the ""Real"" radio button is chosen at the top                        center of the screen.
Each of the molecules in the table below is one of the molecules you can                        chose from the pull down menu in the simulation. Chose each of the molecules                        and fill in the appropriate information in the table.
It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not                    the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries                    (electron geometries) you determined in the previous activities describe all                    regions where electrons are located around the central atom. Molecular structure                    describes the location of the atoms around the central atom, not the                    electrons.
We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that                    includes all electron pairs the electron-pair geometry or electron geometry. The                    structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is                    called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as                    the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the                    central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on                    the central atom.
For example, the methane molecule, CH4, which is the major component                    of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon                    atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure.                    On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH3, also has four electron                    pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral                    electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is                    not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape                    of the molecule.
If you would like to open the simulation in a separate tab, click this                            link:Molecular                            Shapes
Toggle back to the ""Real Molecules"" section of the simulation. In the ""Name""                        section check both the ""Molecule Geometry"" and the ""Electron Geometry."" In                        the ""Options"" section, check ""Show Lone Pairs."" Each of the molecules in the                        tables below is a molecule from the pull down list. Choose each molecule and                        fill in the table appropriately. When you are finished filling in the                        information for one of the molecules, uncheck the ""Show Lone Pairs"" option,                        to observe the molecule shape more clearly.

24,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Periodic Variations in Element Properties,"The elements in groups (vertical columns) of the periodic table exhibit similar chemical            behavior. This similarity occurs because the members of a group have the same number and            distribution of electrons in their valence shells. However, there are also other            patterns in chemical properties on the periodic table. For example, as we move down a            group, the metallic character of the atoms increases. Oxygen, at the top of group 16            (6A), is a colorless gas; in the middle of the group, selenium is a semiconducting            solid; and, toward the bottom, polonium is a silver-grey solid that conducts            electricity.
As we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an            electron to the valence shell with each successive element. As we go down the elements            in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remains constant, but the            principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of the electronic            structure of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their            chemical behavior. These properties vary periodically as the electronic structure of the            elements changes. The periodic properties we will examine in this module are:
(1) size (radius) of atoms and ions,
(2) ionization energies, and
(3) electron affinities.

25,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Formula Mass,"Earlier we described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of averageatomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup ofsubstances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substancesformula.
For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atomscomposing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may becorrectly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic andnow primarily used in the production of the canti-stickd polymer, Teflon. Themolecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains onecarbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecularmass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the averageatomic masses of these atoms. The table below outlines the calculations used toderive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.

Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and theactive ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Adviland Motrin. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound?
Molecules of this compound are comprised of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2oxygen atoms. Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass forthis compound is therefore:
Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios toyield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compoundis calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compounds formula.Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not representthe composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred toas the cmolecular mass.d
As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common tablesalt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations,Na+, and chloride anions, Cl, combined in a 1:1ratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu.
Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ioniccompound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various waterpurification processes. What is the formula mass (amu) of this compound?

26,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Pressure,"The earths atmosphere exerts a pressure, as doesany other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric pressure, we are sensitiveto pressure changesfor example, when your ears cpopd during take-off and landing whileflying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gasmolecules colliding with the surfaces of objects. Although the force of each collisionis very small, any surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisionsin a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air pressure isstrong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from insidethe container.
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of thecolumn of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object, such as the tanker car. Atsea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown Africanelephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. Ifyou actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twicethe usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.
In general, pressure is defined as theforce exerted on a given area: P=FA. Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inverselyproportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing theamount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure canbe decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area.
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal(Pa), with 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 , where N is the newton, a unit of forcedefined as 1 kg m/s2. One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases,it is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) or bar (1 bar= 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds offorce on an area of one square inchpounds per square inch (psi)for example, incar tires. Pressure can also be measured using the unit atmosphere (atm), whichoriginally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximatelatitude of Paris (45).
The most commonly used units in this courseare kPa, atm, and mmHg or torr. The unit of mmHg refers to pressure measured ina barometer, which we will discuss shortly. At standard atmospheric pressure or atm the height of a column of mercury in a barometer is 760 mm. A torr is aunit that can be used interchangeably with mmHg, named after EvangelistaTorricelli, inventor of the barometer.
The US Weather Service reports airpressure in inches of mercury. If the pressure is reported on a particularday as 29.5 in. Hg, what is the pressure in units of atm? (1 inch = 2.54cm)
Here we will use a multi-stepdimensional analysis to make the conversion.
A typical barometric pressure in KansasCity is 742 torr. What is this pressure in kilopascals?
Remember that a torr is the same asmmHg. We will use the following steps to make the conversion:",Reference: The Periodic Table of\r\n\t\t\t\t\tElements,what is the same as the force of a collision between two objects?,30.106914520263672
27,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,"Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat","Thermal energykinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and            molecules. Temperatureintensive property of matter that is a quantitative measure of chotnessd and ccoldnessd is a quantitative measure of chotd or ccold.d When the atoms and            molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average            kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is chot.d When the atoms and molecules            are moving slowly, they have lower KE, and we say that the object is ccoldd. Assuming            that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs,            increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature            to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as            condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of            matter will cause its temperature to decrease.

Heattransfer of thermal energy between two bodies (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at            different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases            the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we            initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low            temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a            higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L,            the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The            temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the            temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules.            Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature.

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A            change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion            reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that releases heatthis            process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torchs flame. A            reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that absorbs heat. A cold pack used to            treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances            in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the            resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

28,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Introduction to Aqueous Solutions,"In preceding sections, we focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter            that contain only one type of element or compound. However, mixturessamples of matter            containing two or more substances physically combinedare more commonly encountered in            nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition            of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount            of oxygen in a planets atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The            relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known            as an calloyd) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative            amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving            the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage            determines its sweetness. In this section, we will describe one of the most common ways            in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.
We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the                    composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout                    its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been                    implemented in many forms of man-made technology. Here we will introduce some of                    the basic properties of solutions.
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration.                    Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentrationquantitative measure of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present in a solution                    that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component                    is called the solventsolution component present in a concentration that is higher relative to other components and may be viewed as the medium in which the other                    components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent                    are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the                    solvent is called an aqueous solutionsolution for which water is the solvent. Water has the ability to dissolve many                    different types of substances. Because of this, it is often referred to as the                    universal solvent.

A solutesolution component present in a concentration less than that of the solvent is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower                    concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with                    qualitative terms such as dilutequalitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively low concentration (of relatively low concentration) and                    concentratedqualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively high concentration (of relatively high concentration).

29,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Introduction to Colligative Properties,"The properties of a solution are different from those of either the pure solute(s) or            solvent. Many solution properties are dependent upon the chemical identity of the            solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is more acidic, a            solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a            solution of sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that            depend only upon the total concentration of solute species, regardless of their            identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling point            elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties            is of central importance to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as            will be described in this module.

30,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,How to Use the OLI Course,"This course is thoughtfully designed (relying heavily on research-based principles of            learning science) to guide you through your learning of General                 Chemistry. Understanding how and why the course is set-up as it is will help you better            utilize all aspects of the course and allow you to more successfully and efficiently learn            the concepts.
One of the first things you will notice as you begin is that at the top of every                    core content page there are one or more learning objectives.
Learning Objectives appear at the top of the page to guide your learning.
These learning objectives are intended to guide you as to what you should be                    accomplishing on that page(s). It is a good idea to make a mental note of, or even write                    down, these learning objectives and reflect on them as you are going through the                    content. Ask yourself, ""Am I achieving this objective?""
There are many activities throughout this course. The activities are                    designed to more fully engage you in the learning process. You will notice there                    are two categories of activities within the modules: Learn By                        Doing and Did I Get This. These types of                    activities are designed in different ways, each for a unique purpose.
The Learn By Doing activities are designed to                            scaffold your learning. They provide significantly more guidance than                            the Did I Get This activities in a number of                            ways. One of the more obvious methods of guidance is hints. You will                            notice that many of these activities have hints. If you are unsure how                            to approach a problem, ask for a hint to guide you. Note that some                            problems have multiple hints.
Learn By Doing activities scaffold practice. Ask for a hint if you are unsure how to progress.
An additional way you will see that Learn By                            Doing activities help to scaffold learning is to present                            problems in a step-by-step manner. Learn By                                Doing activities are usually presented before Did I Get This activities.
Some Learn By Doing activities present problem solving in a                                 step-by-step manner                                 to scaffold practice.                                
The Did I Get This activities are designed to be                            a self-assessment. Problems generally do not include hints and are                            generally not presented in a step-wise manner. This is your opportunity                            to determine after reading through the material and performing the                            numerous activities that preceded, whether or not you ""got"" the concept.                            In the event that you feel that you have not ""gotten"" the concept, it is                            a good idea to go back and review the previous material and/or seek help                            from your instructor.
Did I get this activities allow you to self-assess your understanding before a graded assignment. 
My Response activity links are at the end of each                            module. These activities allow you to reflect on how well you learned                            the concepts presented. Reflecting on your own learning, also know as                            metacognition, is a proven way to promote the                            development of effective learning.
You also have the opportunity to include questions you might have for                            your instructor. Your responses are sent to your instructor and may be                            used in classroom discussions.
Click on the My Response link to reflect on your understanding and provide feedback to your instructor. 
There is a Checkpoint at the end of each module and unit.                                                         This is a graded assignment and the score will be reported to your                            instructor. Your instructor may decide to assign points to your overall grade in                            the course for these assignments.
There are many numeric input problems within this course. For any of                            these you may use standard notation or scientific notation. It is highly                            recommended for very small or very large values that you use scientific                            notation.
For exponents, use the letter e. For example, for 6.022                            enter 6.022e23.

31,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,International System of Units,"Measurements provide the macroscopic information that is the basis of most of the            hypotheses, theories, and laws that describe the behavior of matter and energy in both            the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three            kinds of information:
While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the            uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented            and will be discussed later. The number in the measurement can be represented in            different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation.
Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for            measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of            the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees            to be 1 liter. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life            threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patients seizures            and states a dosage of d without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing            to the medical professional giving the dose, but also the consequences can be dire: 100 mg            given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of            100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.
We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version            of the metric system, using the units listed in table below. Other units can be derived            from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international            agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units (from the            French, Le Systme International dUnits). SI units have been used by the United States            National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964.
Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream                    is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons                    (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but                    these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI                    units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a                    length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix kilo means                    cone thousand,d which in scientific notation is 103 (1 kilometer =                    1000 m = 103 m). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are                    raised are listed in table below.
The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI                    system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original                    standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and                    eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units                    commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent                    units.
The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the                    meter (m). A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from                    the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a                    vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer                    than a yard (Figure); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer                    distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 103 m),                    whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m =                        10-2 m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10-3 m).
The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). The kilogram was                    previously defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry                    (IUPAC) as the mass of a specific reference object. This object was originally                    one liter of pure water, and more recently it was a metal cylinder made from a                    platinum-iridium alloy with a height and diameter of 39 mm. In May                    2019, this definition was changed to one that is based instead on precisely                    measured values of several fundamental physical constants. One kilogram is                    about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass of the                    kilogram (10 kg).
Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin                    (K). The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K                    (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word cdegreed nor the degree                    symbol (°). The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system,                    with both the word cdegreed and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements.                    Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales                    place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C) and                    boils at 373.15 K (100 °C) by definition, and normal human body temperature                    is approximately 310 K (37 °C). The conversion between these two units and                    the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this module.
The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be                    expressed with the appropriate prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003                    s = 3 × 10-6 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5 ×                        106 s. Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.

32,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Ionic Bond Formation,"Chemical bonding is the force of attraction that holds two or more atoms                    together. Chemical bonding is the result of atoms gaining, losing, or sharing                    valence electrons. Ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound form from the transfer of electrons from one atom                    to another to form positively and negatively charged ions. Covalent bondsbond formed when electrons are shared between atoms form                    when two or more atoms share electrons. But why do atoms have this tendency to                    gain, lose, or share electrons to form compounds? The answer has to do with the                    stability of electron configurations. The most stable arrangement of electrons                    is when the outer shell is full. With the exception of the  first shell which                    is full with two electrons, all of the other shells are full with eight                    electrons. It is important to recognize that when the outer shell is full this                    corresponds to the electron configuration of a noble gas. From this general                    observation comes a very important concept of chemical bonding the Octet Ruleguideline that states main group atoms will form structures in which eight valence electrons interact with each nucleus, counting bonding electrons as interacting with both atoms connected by the bond.                    Main group elements will gain, lose, or share electrons in order to obtain the                    electron configuration of a noble gas.

Previously, we discussed the basic concepts of ionic and covalent bonding. In                    this unit, we will look at chemical bonding in more detail, beginning here with                    ionic bonding.
As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A                    cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons                    from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom                    gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.
Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their                    constituent ions are held together by ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound: electrostatic forces of                    attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of                    ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids                    exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend                    to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are                    very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same                    reasonthe strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid                    state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or                    melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because                    the ions can move about freely.

Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical                    properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that                    burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form                    chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to                    most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction                    between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline compound                    sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride                    anions. The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely                    different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is                    poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react                    vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.
Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms                    the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a                    binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in                    terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have                    relatively low ionization energies and lose electrons easily. The lower the IE                    the more easily the atom loses electrons and the more chemically reactive. The                    most chemically reactive metals are in the lower left of the periodic table.                    Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain                    electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. The most                    chemically reactive nonmetals are found in the upper-right corner of the                    periodic table not including the noble gases. The noble gases have very high                    ionization energies and very low electron affinities. With only a few                    exceptions, the noble gases do not form chemical bonds and are extremely                    unreactive.
As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive                    charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of                    negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the                    simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of                    positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide,                        Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound contains two                    aluminum cations, Al3+, for every three oxide anions, O2                    [thus, (2  +3) + (3  ) = 0].
It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not                    represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a                    sodium chloride (NaCl) cmoleculed because there is not a single ionic bond, per                    se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces                    between ions are isotropicthe same in all directionsmeaning that any                    particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite                    charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound,                    three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a                    regular arrangement of equal numbers of Na+ cations and                        Cl anions.

33,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,"The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are            empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The            mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases            at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships            that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these            relationships.
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively            explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is            based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term cmoleculed will            be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some            gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)
The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the            behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT,            which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately            represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws            (Boyles, Charless, Gay-Lussac\'s, Avogadros, and Daltons laws) conceptually to see            how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships            between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain            Grahams law.
Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends            directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we            see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas. In the following series of            activities use your knowledge of the gas laws to answer the following questions, thereby            making the connection as to how the KMT explains the observations that result in the gas            laws.

34,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Lewis Symbols,"Thus far in this unit, we have discussed the various types of bonds that form between            atoms and/or ions. In all cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence            shell electrons between atoms. In this module, we will explore the typical method for            depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely Lewis symbolssymbol for an element or monatomic ion that uses a dot to represent each valence electron in the element or ion and Lewis structuresdiagram showing lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons in a molecule or an ion.

diagram showing lone pairs and bonding pairs of electrons in a molecule or an ion
We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic            ions. A Lewis symbol consists of an elemental symbol surrounded by one dot for each of            its valence electrons:
The table below shows the Lewis symbols for the elements of the third period of the            periodic table.
Lewis symbols can also be used to illustrate the formation of cations from atoms, as            shown here for sodium and calcium:

35,Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter,Matter,"                        Matter                                                                                    Anything that occupies space and has mass.                                                                         is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass, and it is all                    around us. Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they                    take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also                    matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would stay collapsed rather                    than inflate when filled with gas.
Anything that occupies space and has mass.
Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on                    earth. A                         solid                                                                                    State of matter that has a definite shape and definite                                    volume.                                                                         is rigid and possesses a definite shape. A                         liquid                                                                                    State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.                                                                         flows and takes the shape of a container, except that it forms a flat                    or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity,                    liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes                    that are very nearly independent of pressure. A                         gas                                                                                    State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take                                    on the shape and volume of its container.                                                                         takes both the shape and volume of its container.
State of matter that has a definite shape and definite                                    volume.
State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.
State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take                                    on the shape and volume of its container.
Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases                    at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small                    pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is                    composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of                    more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to                    behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny                    particles of water (liquid or solid).
A fourth state of matter, plasma                                                                        A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.                                                            , occurs naturally in the interiors of stars and                    other high temperature situations. Like gases, plasmas are less dense than                    liquids or solids and do not have a fixed shape or volume. But unlike gases,                    plasmas contain significant amounts of electrically charged particles that are                    able to move freely. Due to these mobile charged particles, plasmas are very                    conductive and highly responsive to external electric or magnetic fields. In                    addition to stars, plasmas are found in neon signs, plasma TVs, lightning and                    the plasma torch (shown in the image below being used to cut through metal).
A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.
The                         mass                                                                                    The measure of the amount of matter of an object.                                                                         of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to                    measure an objects mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the                    object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the                    car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is                    to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.
The measure of the amount of matter of an object.
Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing.                         Weight                                                                                    The force that gravity exerts on an object.                                                                         refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is                    directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes                    as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronauts mass does                    not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only                    one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moons gravity is only one-sixth                    that of the earths.
The force that gravity exerts on an object.
The                         law of conservation of matter                                                                                    There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.                                                                         summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that                    there is no change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts                    from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or                    gaseous states (a physical change). This can be seen in a lead-acid car battery:                    The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable                    of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and                    water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of                    matter.
There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.
Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter,                    convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled                    conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is                    produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and                    assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But                    because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted                    as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.

36,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Phase Changes,"When a liquid is heated the kinetic energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions                    increases. At some point the KE is great enough to overcome the forces holding                    the substance together in the liquid phase and the particles escape into the gas                    phase. This is called vaporization. If a gaseous substance is cooled, at some                    point, it will change into its liquid phase. This is known as condensation.
When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms,                    molecules, or ions and the solid gets hotter. At some point, the added energy                    becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or                    ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of                    transitioning to the liquid state, or melting. If we cool a liquid, the kinetic                    energy decreases. At some point, the IMFs will become greater than the KE and                    the substance will be held tightly together in a fixed position, which we call                    freezing.
Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid                    state, via a process known as sublimation. At room temperature and standard                    pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to                    gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid.                     When solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms                    as seen in the image below. The reverse of sublimation is called deposition, a process in which                    gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid                    state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition.

37,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Crystalline vs. Amorphous Solids,"When most liquids are cooled, they eventually freeze and form crystalline solids, solids            in which the atoms, ions, or molecules are arranged in a definite repeating pattern. It            is also possible for a liquid to freeze before its molecules become arranged in an            orderly pattern. The resulting materials are called amorphous solids or noncrystalline            solids (or, sometimes, glasses). The particles of such solids lack an ordered internal            structure and are randomly arranged.
Metals and ionic compounds typically form ordered, crystalline solids. Substances that            consist of large molecules, or a mixture of molecules whose movements are more            restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle waxes are amorphous solids            composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide (shown            below), can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions            under which it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the            crystalline state under appropriate conditions.

French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely            regarded as the cfather of modern chemistry,d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, cIt took the mob only a moment            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.
As described in an earlier in this course, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for            answers to many of the questions that ask cHow much?d We can answer the question with            masses of substances or volumes of solutions. However, we can also answer this question            another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the            pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the            ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal            with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions            involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will            provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already            discussed.

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of                    molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and                    temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a standard temperature                        and pressure (STP)standard temperature                            and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm                    (101.325 kPa). At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 Lthis is                    referred to as the standard molar volumevolume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally.
standard temperature                            and pressure (STP)
volume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally
One mole of any gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 L.
*Note that this relationship ONLY applies when the gas is at STP.
We can calculate the molar volume of a gas by using the ideal gas law.
What is the volume of 1.00 mol of He at a pressure of 1.00 atm and 273.15                        K?
\equire{cancel} V = \\frac{(1.00 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(273.15 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1.00                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}} = 22.4 \\mathrm{L}
Recognize that the answer in the above example would have been the same                    regardless of the type of gas identified in the problem. 1 mole of ANY gas at                    STP has a volume of This provides a simple conversion factor to use in                    situations when gases are at STP.
A 4.9 g sample of methane, CH4, gas is at standard temperature and                        pressure. What volume does the sample occupy?
Notice here that the amount of gas is given in grams. We will need to convert                        from grams to moles and then use the relationship between moles and volume                        of gas at STP to convert to volume.
\\mathrm{g} \ightarrow \\mathrm{mol} \ightarrow                            \\mathrm{L}
4.9 \\mathrm{\\cancel{g\\ CH_4}} \imes \\frac{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\                            CH_4}}}{16.05 \\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ CH_4}}} \imes \\frac{22.4 \\mathrm{L\\                            CH_4}}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ CH_4}}} = 6.84 \\mathrm{L}
The molar volume of a gas can also be applied to more complex stoichiometry                    problems involving reactions. We can add volume of gases to our stoichiometry                    flowchart that we saw earlier.
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas. Zinc reacts with                        hydrochloric acid according to the reactions below.
5.8 g of zinc is reacted with an excess amount hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen                        gas produced is collected at STP. What is the volume of the hydrogen                        gas?
We will use the following steps to solve this problem according to our                        flowchart above:

39,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Introduction to Thermochemistry,"Chemical changes and their accompanying changes in energy are important parts of our            everyday world. The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo            metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a            variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation,            heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous            amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then            used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers,            and bridges.
Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides            the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the            worlds energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store            incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are            both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through            photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant            products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that            comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants.            Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized            plant and animal matter.
This unit will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with            the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changesan area            called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in this unit are widely used in almost            all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy            content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the            metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and            transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find            better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive            to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate            our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics,            among other applications. Understanding thermochemical principles is essential for            chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about            anyone who studies or does any kind of science.",Reference: The Periodic Table of Elements,"what is the function of the macronutrients in food (proteins, fats",15.10045337677002
40,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Introduction to Valence Bond Theory,"As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural            laws or large bodies of experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain            experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For example, VSEPR theory has gained            widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes that are            consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules.            However, VSEPR theory does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.
There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use            quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are            likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a dumbbell shape for a p            orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free            atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe            the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete            understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the            electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms            when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the            nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are            described by valence bond theory and hybridization.
Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled                    atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of                    electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two                    different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second                    orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a                    covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom                    overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each                    orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this                    negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms positively charged nuclei                    serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent                    bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the                    orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are                    stronger than those that have less overlap.
The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. The slideshow                    below illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored                    curve) changes as they approach each other.
The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the                    bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity                    of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same amount of                    energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in the                    slideshow, at the bond distance of 74 pm the system is 7.24  10 J lower in                    energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small number.                    However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond                    energies are often discussed on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24                     10 J to break one HH bond, but it takes 4.36  105 J to break 1 mole of                    HH bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in the table                    below. We can find many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table                    provides average values. For example, breaking the first CH bond in CH4, methane,                     requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first CH bond in H (toluene, a common                    paint thinner) requires 375.5 kJ/mol.

41,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Wave-Particle Duality of Matter,"Bohrs model explained the experimental data for the hydrogen atom and was widelyaccepted, but it also raised many questions. Why did electrons orbit at onlyfixed distances defined by a single quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, butnever in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen andone-electron ions, but could not correctly predict the emission spectrum forhelium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed tocompletely revise the way they thought about matter.
We know how matter behaves in the macroscopic worldobjects that are large enoughto be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiardball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in astraight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or isacted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-definedposition and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, p = mv) at any given moment.In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is thetypical behavior of a classical object.
When waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are notdisplayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example,interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterssimilar to those shown in the image below. This is a case of wave behavior onthe macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are verydifferent phenomena in the macroscopic realm.
As technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic worldin greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very smallpieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for largeobjects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer thecase for the microscopic world.
One of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of themicroscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: Ifelectromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons andother submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoraldissertation, de Broglie extended the waveparticle duality of light thatEinstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles.He predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linearmomentum p) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value\xce\xbb, given by this expression in which h is the familiar Plancks constant:
\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}
This is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of \xce\xbb discussedearlier, the de Broglie wavelength is a characteristic of particles and otherbodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this equation involves velocity[v, m/s], not frequency [\xce\xbd, Hz]). Where Bohr had postulated the electron asbeing a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie arguedthat Bohrs assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron isconsidered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such thatonly an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit.
If an electron travels at a velocity of 1.000  107 m/s and has amass of 9.109  10-28 g, what is its wavelength?
We can use de Broglies equation to solve this problem, but we first must doa unit conversion of Plancks constant. You learned earlier that 1 J = 1 kg/s2. Thus, we can write h = 6.626 -34 J s as 6.626  10-34 kg m2/s.
\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}
\\lambda = \\frac{6.626\imes 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(9.109\imes 10^{-31} \\mathrm{kg})(1.000\imes 10^7 \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}
\\lambda = 7.274 \imes 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m}
This is a small value, but it is significantly larger than the size of anelectron in the classical (particle) view. This size is the same order ofmagnitude as the size of an atom. This means that electron wavelike behavioris going to be noticeable in an atom.
Shortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists atBell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentallythat electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference patternfor electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. Theregularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interferenceexperiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to besimilar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference patternto form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their cslits,dsince the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same asthe de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. In the image below,part a shows an interference pattern. The waveparticle duality of matter can beseen in diagrams below by observing what happens if electron collisions arerecorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons havebeen recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in smalllocalized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrivedand were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelikebehavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localizedparticles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied byclassical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equationthat governs a probability distribution even for a single electrons motion.Thus the waveparticle duality first observed with photons is actually afundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.

42,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Atomic Mass,"Because each proton and each neutron contributeapproximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron contributes far less,the atomic massaverage mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a wholenumber). However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.
Silicon exists as 3 isotopes with their massesand abundances listed below.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.
In this activity, you will explore the naturally occurring isotopes for twoelements. Follow the steps and answer the questions that follow.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.
Based on the information in the massspectra for zirconium in the image above, we can determine that there are 5naturally occurring isotopes of zirconium, Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr, and Zreach with an approximate percent abundance as seen in the table below.

43,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Chemical Equations,"The chemical equation on the previous page is a balanced equation, meaning that equal            numbers of atoms for each element involved in the reaction are represented on the            reactant and product sides.
This is a requirement the equation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of            conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on            either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that            the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of            any formula containing that element by the elements subscript in the formula. If an            element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the number of            atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both            product species in the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the            element oxygen. To determine the total number of oxygen atoms on the product side we add            the 2 atoms of oxygen in the CO2 molecule to the 2 atoms of oxygen in the 2                H2O moleucles for a total of 4 oxygen atoms.
The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and            water is confirmed to be balanced per this approach, as shown here:
Indicate whether the following equations are balanced or unbalanced.
Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N2) and                oxygen (O2) to form dinitrogen pentoxide.
First, write the unbalanced equation.
Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.
Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number                of oxygen atoms. To balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt                would be to change the coefficients for the O2 and                    N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least                common multiple for the O atom subscripts in these two formulas).
The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the                coefficient for the reactant N2 to 2.
The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the                equation is balanced.

It is sometimes convenient to use fractions instead of integers as intermediate            coefficients in the process of balancing a chemical equation. When balance is achieved,            all the equations coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole number to convert the            fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example,            consider the reaction of ethane (C2H6) with oxygen to yield                H2O and CO2 , represented by the unbalanced equation:
Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by            changing the coefficients for the two product species, as shown:
This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd numberno            integer coefficient can be used with the O2 reactant to yield an odd number,            so a fractional coefficient, 7/2, is used instead to yield a provisional balanced            equation:
A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying            each coefficient by 2:
Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the            smallest whole-number coefficients. Although the equation for the reaction between            molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to produce ammonia is, indeed, balanced,
the coefficients are not the smallest possible integers representing the relative numbers            of reactant and product molecules. Dividing each coefficient by the greatest common            factor, 3, gives the preferred equation:
The physical states of reactants and products in chemical equations very often                    are indicated with a parenthetical abbreviation following the formulas. Common                    abbreviations include s for solids, l for liquids, g for gases, and aq for                    substances dissolved in water (aqueous solutions, as introduced in the preceding                    chapter). These notations are illustrated in the example equation here:
This equation represents the reaction that takes place when sodium metal is                    placed in water. The solid sodium reacts with liquid water to produce molecular                    hydrogen gas and the ionic compound sodium hydroxide (a solid in pure form, but                    readily dissolved in water).
Special conditions necessary for a reaction are sometimes designated by writing a                    word or symbol above or below the equations arrow. For example, a reaction                    carried out by heating may be indicated by the uppercase Greek letter delta (\xce)                    over the arrow.
Other examples of these special conditions will be encountered in more depth                    later in the course.

44,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Chemical Stoichiometry and Gases,"Sometimes we can take advantage of asimplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions donot exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number ofmolecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, theratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by thecoefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes aremeasured at the same temperature and pressure.
We can extend Avogadros law (that thevolume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) tochemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simpleproportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the sametemperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases reactto produce ammonia gas according to N2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) f 2 (g), a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three timesthat volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, ifpressure and temperature remain constant.

Propane, C3H8(g), is used in gas grills to provide the heat for cooking. What volume of (g) measured at 25 C and 760 torr is required to reactwith 2.7 L of propane measured under the same conditions of temperature andpressure? Assume that the propane undergoes complete combustion.
The ratio of the volumes ofH 8 and O2 will be equal to the ratioof their coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction:
From the equation, we see that onevolume of C3H8 will react with five volumes of O2 :
\equire{cancel} 2.7\\cancel{\\mathrm{L\\ C_3H_8}} \imes \\frac{5 \\mathrm{L\\ O_2}}{1\\cancel{\\mathrm{L\\ C_3H_8}}} = 13.5 \\mathrm{L\\ O_2}
A volume of 13.5 L of O2will be required to react with 2.7 L of C3H8 .
Not all reactions involving gases takeplace at STP or under constant conditions. In such cases, it may be necessary tocombine stoichiometry techniques with gas laws. Let's take a look at somesuch problems.
What volume of hydrogen at 27 C and torr may be prepared by the reaction of 8.88 g of gallium with an excessof hydrochloric acid?
Note that in a similar problem above weused the molar volume of a gas (22.4 L) to make this calculation. This willnot work here because the reaction does not occur at STP.
To convert from mass of gallium tovolume of H2 (g) we will follow a similar process initially tofind the mol of H2 (g) produced. Then apply the ideal gasequation to find the volume of H2 (g) at the given temperatureand pressure. The steps of the process are seen below:
Convert from g Ga to mol H using stoichiometry.
\equire{cancel} 8.88\\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ Ga}} \imes \\frac{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ Ga}}}{69.72\\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ Ga}}} \imes \\frac{3 \\mathrm{mol\\ H_2}}{2\\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ Ga}}} = 0.191 \\mathrm{mol H_2}
Now apply the ideal gas law tocalculate the volume of H 2 .

45,Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter,Classification of Matter,"An atomThe smallest particle of an element that retains the propertiesof that element. is the smallest particle of an element that has the properties of thatelement and can enter into a chemical combination. Consider the element gold,for example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of thehalves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained thatwas so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knifemay be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek atomos,meaning cindivisibled). This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided anyfurther.
The smallest particle of an element that retains the propertiesof that element.
An atom is so small that its size isdifficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eyeis a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of acentimeter (0.0001 cm) in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand isalmost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. Asingle carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter,and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. Toput this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, thecross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which wouldrequire about 150 million carbon atom cdimesd to cover it.
The mass of an atom is also difficult toimagine. A billion lead atoms (1,000,000,000 atoms) weigh about 3  10-13 grams, a mass that is far too light to be weighed on even theworlds most sensitive balances. It would require over 300,000,000,000,000 leadatoms (300 trillion, or 3  10 14 ) to be weighed, and they wouldweigh only 0.0000001 gram.
It is rare to find collections ofindividual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, andargon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independentlyof one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms. One form ofthe element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. Theelement sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composedof eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A moleculeTwo or more atoms joined together by chemical bonds. consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemicalbonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of sodain a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. Amolecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules foundin the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or moredifferent atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is aunit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose moleculeis a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass ofwater were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside itwould be about the size of golf balls.
Two or more atoms joined together by chemical bonds.
We can classify matter into severalcategories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A pure substanceA substance that has a constant composition. has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance haveexactly the same makeup and properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar)consists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4% oxygen by mass. Any sample ofsucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, andsweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated.
A substance that has a constant composition.
We can divide pure substances into twoclasses: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken down intosimpler substances by chemical changes are called elementsPure substances that cannot be broken down into simplersubstances by chemical changes.. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiarexamples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturallyon the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories. Allelements are listed on the Periodic Table of Elements as seen below. It islikely that you are familiar with many of these elements, but not all. We willdiscuss the Periodic Table in much more detail a little later in thiscourse.
Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simplersubstances by chemical changes.
Pure substances that can be broken down bychemical changes are called compoundsPure substances that can be broken down into simpler substancesby chemical changes.. This breakdown may produce either elements or other compounds, orboth. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down byheat into the elements mercury and oxygen as seen below. When heated in theabsence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon andthe compound water.
Pure substances that can be broken down into simpler substancesby chemical changes.
The properties of combined elements aredifferent from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, whitecrystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemicalcombination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of itsuncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorlessgases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallicsolid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to formsodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.
A mixtureSubstance composed of two or more types of matter that can bepresent in varying amounts and can be separated by physicalchanges. is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present invarying amounts and can be separated by physical changes, such as evaporation(you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that variesfrom point to point is called a heterogeneous mixtureA mixture with a composition that varies from point to point andtherefore has visibly different parts.. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture, as seen inthe image on left below. Its composition can vary because we can make it fromvarying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point topoint throughout the mixtureone drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a differentdrop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and theherbs settle to the bottom of the container. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chipcookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) andgranite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).
Substance composed of two or more types of matter that can bepresent in varying amounts and can be separated by physicalchanges.
A mixture with a composition that varies from point to point andtherefore has visibly different parts.
A homogeneous mixtureA mixture that has a uniform composition and appears visually thesame throughout., also called a solution, exhibits a uniform composition and appearsvisually the same throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink,consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes mixed togetheruniformly. Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each dropcontains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that thecomposition of a sports drink can varyit could be made with somewhat more orless sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Otherexamples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and asolution of salt in water.
A mixture that has a uniform composition and appears visually thesame throughout.
Although there are just over 100 elements,tens of millions of chemical compounds result from different combinations ofthese elements. Each compound has a specific composition and possesses definitechemical and physical properties by which we can distinguish it from all othercompounds. And, of course, there are innumerable ways to combine elements andcompounds to form different mixtures.
Drag the terms from the bottom of the activity into their appropriateposition in the flowchart below.
Eleven elements make up about 99% of theearths crust and atmosphere. Oxygen constitutes nearly one-half and siliconabout one-quarter of the total quantity of these elements. A majority ofelements on earth are found in chemical combinations with other elements; aboutone-quarter of the elements are also found in the free state.

46,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Covalent Radius,"The quantum mechanical picture makes it difficultto establish a definite size of an atom. However, there are several practical ways todefine the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that giveroughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius as seen in the figure below,which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms whenthey are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms withinmolecules still retain much of their atomic identity).
We know that as we scan down a group, the principalquantum number, n, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are beingadded to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently,the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distanceof the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalentradii of the halogens below.
In the diagram below, you can see the trendin covalent atomic radius for the whole periodic table. Note that within a groupthe covalent atomic radius increases from top to bottom.
As you can see in the image above, as wemove across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element hasa smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seemcounterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have asmaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effectivenuclear charge, Zeff. This is the pull exerted on a specificelectron by the nucleus, taking into account any electronelectron repulsions.For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge (Z) and theeffective nuclear charge (Zeff) are equal. For all other atoms, theinner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of thenucleus, and thus:
Z_{eff} = Z - \\mathrm{shielding}
Shielding is determined by the probabilityof another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, aswell as by the electronelectron repulsions the electron of interest encounters.Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shelldo not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently.Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, Zeffincreases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, Zincreases as we move from left to right across a period. Thestronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on theright side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making thecovalent radii smaller.
Since it is the core electrons that shieldthe nucleus, we can use this number of core electrons to estimate Zefffor an element. Note that these Zeff values fromthis calculations are approximations, but can be used for comparing Zeffof elements within the same period. For example a sodium atomhas 11 protons and 11 electrons, 10 of which are core electrons that shield the valence electron from the attractive force of the 11 protons in the nucleus.We can approximate Zeff as 11 - 10 = +1. Similarly a magnesium atomhas 12 protons and 12 electrons, 10 of which are core electrons. Zeff= 12 - 10 = +2. This is illustrated in the image below.
The larger value of Zeff forMg indicates that there is a stronger attractive force that exists between thenucleus and valence electrons in the Mg atom than exists between the nucleus andvalence electron of the sodium atom. The result of this stronger attraction isthat the Mg atom is slightly smaller than the Na atom even though it has moreelectrons.
The graph below further illustrates thetrend of atomic radii:

47,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Derived Quantities,"We can derive many quantities from the seven SI base quantities. For example, we can use the base            quantity of length to define volume, and the base quantities of mass and length to            define density.
                        Volume                                                                                    amount of space occupied by an object.                                                                         is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The                    standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length. The standard                    volume is a cubic meter (m3), a cube with an edge length of exactly                    one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with                    edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or                    any other substance.
amount of space occupied by an object.
A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10                    cm). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one                    cubic decimeter (dm3). A liter (L) is the more common name for the                    cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.
A cubic centimeter (cm3) is the volume of a cube with an edge length                    of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often                    used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is also called a milliliter                    (mL) and is 1/1000 of a liter.
Volume is a very common unit of measure used in chemistry. Below are images of                    common glassware used to measure volume.
We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its                         density                                                                                    ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object                                                                        . Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and                    length.
ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object
The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance                    to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter                        (kg/m3). For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient                    unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) or grams per milliliter (g/mL)                    for the                    densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. Although                    there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from                    about 0.7 g/cm3 (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm3 (the                    density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L. The table shows the                    densities of some common substances.
While there are many ways to determine the density of an object, perhaps the most                    straightforward method involves separately finding the mass and volume of the                    object, and then dividing the mass of the sample by its volume. In the following                    example, the mass is found directly by weighing, but the volume is found                    indirectly through length measurements.

Goldin bricks, bars, and coinshas been a form of currency for centuries.                        In order to swindle people into paying for a brick of gold without actually                        investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling the centers of                        hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire                        brick is gold. It does not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density                        is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm3. What is the density of lead if                        a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?
(We will discuss the reason for rounding to the first decimal place in the                        next section.)
What is the density of the rubber stopper seen in the image to the left if                        its mass is 10.32 g?
To determine the density of an irregularly shaped solid we can use the                        process of water displacement. The initial volume is recorded, in this                        example 30.0 mL. Then the object is carefully placed in the water and the                        new volume is recorded, in this example 35.6 mL. The difference between the                        initial volume and the final volume is the volume of the object.

48,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Electrolytes,"Water is referred to as the universal solvent because it can dissolve many different            types of substances. However, not all substances dissolve in water in the same way.            Let\'s look at ordinary table salt, NaCl, and table sugar,                C12H22O11 (sucrose), dissolved in water. You know            from everyday experience that both of these substances are soluble in water, but on a            molecular level the way in which they dissolve is quite different and results in            solutions with different properties.
When NaCl dissolves in water, the sodium ions and the chloride ions break away from the            solid and each individual ion is surrounded by water molecules. This breaking apart of            the ions is referred to as                 dissociation                                                            physical process accompanying the dissolution of an ionic compound in                            which the compounds constituent ions are solvated and dispersed                            throughout the solution                                                . NaCl is a substance that completely, or nearly completely dissociates in            water. Nearly 100% of the ions separate into the solution.
physical process accompanying the dissolution of an ionic compound in                            which the compounds constituent ions are solvated and dispersed                            throughout the solution
One important property of the resulting solution is its ability to conduct electricity.            Conductivity of a solution can be tested with an apparatus such as the one seen below.            Solutions that contain charged particles (ions) allow the electric current to flow            between the anodes. This will complete the circuit and cause the light bulb to light up.            Substances, like NaCl, that conduct electricity when dissolved in water are called                 electrolytes                                                            substances that produces ions when dissolved in water                                                . More specifically NaCl is a                 strong electrolyte                                                            substance that dissociates or ionizes completely when dissolved in                            water                                                 because it conducts electricity very well.

As seen in the animation above when salt is dissolved in water, the resulting solution            conducts electricity.

The reason the solution conducts electricity is that the ions in the NaCl completely            dissociate in water breaking apart into Na+ and Cl- ions, as seen            in the animation above.
When sugar dissolves in water, it does something quite different on the molecular level            than salt. The individual sugar molecules do not dissociate. Because there are no            charged particles (ions) in the solution, the sugar solution does not conduct            electricity.

The reason the sugar water does not conduct electricity is because the sugar does not            dissociate in water to form ions. Notice in the animation above that the sugar molecule            remains intact when dissolved in water. Substances, such as sugar, that when dissolved            in water do not conduct electricity are referred to as                 nonelectrolytes                                                            substances that does not produce ions when dissolved in water                                                .
substances that does not produce ions when dissolved in water
Other substances when dissolved in water only dissociate to a small extent. Acetic acid,            vinegar, is an example of one such substance. When acetic acid is in water it            dissociates only slightly (about 1%). There are some charged particles in the solution,            but relatively few. Because of this, an acetic acid solution will conduct electricity,            but only to a small extent. Substances that conduct electricity to a small extent are            referred to as                 weak electrolytes                                                            substances that ionizes only partially when dissolved in water                                                .             Whereas NaCl, as discussed previously, that completely dissociates and conducts electricity to a large extent is a strong electrolyte.
substances that ionizes only partially when dissolved in water
Under most conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,            and are classified as strong electrolytes. Most molecular compounds, with the exception            of acids, do not dissociate when dissolved in water and are nonelectrolytes.
While acids and bases will be discussed in more detail later, it is important to note            here that strong acids are strong electrolytes because they completely dissociate into                H+ and their constituent anion. For instance, the strong acid nitric            acid, HNO3, dissociates into H+ and NO3-            ions. Likewise, the strong acid perchloric acid dissociates into H+ and                ClO4-.
Weak acids and bases, on the other hand, are weak electrolytes. Weak acids only            dissociate slightly. As we saw above with the weak acid, acetic acid. While it does            produce H+ and C2H3O2- ions, it            only does so to a small extent.

49,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Electronic Structure of Ions,"When forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its                    valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that                    precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the                    alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence                    shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from                    atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For                    example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and                    a ground state electron configuration of                    1s22s22p63s23p64s2.                    When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with                    18 electrons, a 2+ charge, and an electron configuration of                    1s22s22p63s23p6. The                    Ca2+ ion is therefore isoelectronic with the noble gas Ar.                    Likewise, the potassium ion, K+, has 18 electrons and is                    isoelectronicgroup of ions or atoms that have identical electron configurations with the noble gas Ar.
group of ions or atoms that have identical electron configurations
For metals in groups 12, the group numbers exceed the number of valence                    electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full d subshells in atoms of                    elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed                    by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10. For                    example, aluminum (in group 13) forms 3+ ions (Al3+).
Exceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the                    groups. In addition to the expected ions Tl3+, Sn4+,                    Pb4+, and Bi5+, a partial loss of these atoms valence                    shell electrons can also lead to the formation of Tl+,                    Sn2+, Pb2+, and Bi3+ ions. The formation of                    these 1+, 2+, and 3+ cations is ascribed to the inert pair effect, which                    reflects the relatively low energy of the valence s-electron pair for atoms of                    the heavy elements of groups 13, 14, and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an                    unexpected behavior: it forms a diatomic ion, Hg22+ (an                    ion formed from two mercury atoms, with an Hg-Hg bond), in addition to the                    expected monatomic ion Hg2+ (formed from only one mercury atom).
Transition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main                    group elements. Most transition metal cations have 2+ or 3+ charges that result                    from the loss of their outermost s electron(s) first, sometimes followed by the                    loss of one or two d electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example,                    iron                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2)                    forms the ion Fe2+                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d6)                    by the loss of the 4s electron and the ion Fe3+                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d5)                    by the loss of the 4s electron and one of the 3d electrons. Although the d                    orbitals of the transition elements areaccording to the Aufbau principlethe                    last to fill when building up electron configurations, the outermost s electrons                    are the first to be lost when these atoms ionize.
There are at least 14 elements categorized as cessential trace elementsd for                        the human body. They are called cessentiald because they are required for                        healthy bodily functions, ctraced because they are required only in small                        amounts, and celementsd in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two                        of these essential trace elements, chromium and zinc, are required as Cr3+                        and Zn2+. Write the electron configurations of these cations.
First, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms:
Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition                        metals, electrons are removed from the s orbital first and then from the d                        orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p orbitals                        and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have                        a charge of 2+, and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital.                        Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons and then                        its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron                        configurations of the ions:
Most monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to                    completely fill its outer s and p orbitals, thereby reaching the electron                    configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to determine the charge                    on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must                    be gained to fill the s and p orbitals of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example,                    has the electron configuration 1s22s22p4,                    whereas the oxygen anion has the electron configuration of the noble gas neon                    (Ne), 1s22s22p6. The two additional electrons                    required to fill the valence orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2                    (O2).
Selenium and iodine are two essential trace elements that form anions. Write                        the electron configurations of the anions.

One type of work (w) is the process of causing matter            to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle            tirewe move matter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already            in the tire.

Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two            types: (i)                potential energy                                                            energy of a particle or system of particles derived from relative                            position, composition, or condition                                                , the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or            condition, and (ii)                kinetic energy                                                            energy of a moving body, in joules, equal to 1/2 mv2 (where                                m = mass and v =                            velocity)                                                , the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of            a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward            through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce            electricity in a hydroelectric plant. A battery has potential energy because the            chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.

Kinetic energy is dependent on an object\'s mass and velocity according to the                    following equation:
Where m is mass in kg and v is                    velocity in m/s. If mass,  m is in kg and velocity, v, is in m/s, then the kinetic energy has units of                    Joules (J = kg m2/s2).
Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before            a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This            observation is expressed in the                 law of conservation of energy                                                            during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor                            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.                                                : during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.

In the simulation above, follow the directions and answer the questions that                follow.
Return to the simulation.
Check to see if your calculations match the approximate values given for PE and KE in                the bar graph of the simulation.
As you are likely aware the assumption in the previous exercise, that no energy was lost            to friction, is not what occurs in the real world. As well as having kinetic and            potential energy, energy is being transferred from the skateboard to the surface of the            track in the form of thermal energy caused by the interaction between the wheels of the            skateboard and the surface of the track. Return to the skatepark simulation and choose            the ""Friction"" screen. Again click to show the bar graph. Drag the skater to the top of            the track and observe the changes in energy now that the thermal energy due to friction            is accounted for.
When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of            one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the            conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example,            chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose            gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a cars engine, the rapidly            expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type            of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders pistons.
For chemical reactions, mass and energy are conserved separately. The total mass present            before the reaction occurs is equal to the total mass present after the reaction occurs.            Likewise, the total energy present before the reaction occurs is equal to the total            energy present after the reaction occurs. However, for nuclear reactions, mass can be            converted into energy according to Einsteins formula (E = mc2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light). In nuclear reactions, the total mass            changes and this leads to changes in energy that are much larger (by factors of a            million or so) than chemical reactions. To encompass both chemical and nuclear changes,            we combine these laws into one statement: The total quantity of matter and energy in the            universe is fixed. For most of this course, we will considering only chemical reactions,            and so energy and mass are separately conserved.
The animations and activities that follow show how energy is transformed from one type to            another in certain processes. In considering systems such as these, kinetic energy is            often referred to as mechanical energy.",,what can be a suitable title for the text?,72.20512390136719
51,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Enthalpy of Combustion,"Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the                    reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a                    commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the                    determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the                    IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions                    at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list                    values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the \xceH of                    a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure (1 bar =                    0.987 atm), \xceH values (except for the most precisely                    measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard                    conditions. We will include a superscripted cod in the enthalpy change symbol to                    designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard)                    temperature is 298.15 K, we will use a subscripted d to designate this                    temperature. Thus, the symbol                                                     Δ                                                            H                                298                                o                                                                         is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under                    these conditions. (The symbol \xceH is used to indicate an                    enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)
The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are                    available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions,                    phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it                    is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy                    changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the                    amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the                    \xceH for specific amounts of reactants). However, we                    often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (\xceH) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive                    value of \xceH, often cnormalizedd to a per-mole basis.                    (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat                    from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)
Standard enthalpy of combustion (                                    Δ                                            H                        C                        o                                                 ) is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously            with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called cheat of            combustion.d For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, .8 kJ/mol, is the            amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at 25 C            and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at 25 C and 1 atm.
Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are            listed in the table below. Many readily available substances with large enthalpies of            combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as coal or charcoal), and            hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane,            and the major components of gasoline.
As seen in the image below, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic                process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L                of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of                isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692                g/mL.
Starting with a known amount (1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions                between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy                of combustion of isooctane provides one of the necessary conversions. The table                above gives this value as  kJ per 1 mole of isooctane                    (C8H18).
The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This is alot of                energy; it is enough to melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)",,what's the relationship of the two reactants and products under the same conditions?,63.70226287841797
52,Solutions,Solubility,The Formation of Solutions,"The formation of a solution is an example of a spontaneous process, a process that occurs            under specified conditions without the requirement of energy from some external source.            Sometimes we stir a mixture to speed up the dissolution process, but this is not            necessary; a homogeneous solution would form if we waited long enough. The topic of            spontaneity is critically important to the study of chemical thermodynamics and is            treated more thoroughly in a later unit. For purposes of this moduless discussion, it            will suffice to consider two criteria that favor, but do not guarantee, the spontaneous            formation of a solution:
In the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as            heat is absorbed or evolved. An increase in disorder always results when a solution            forms.
When the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent            species in a solution are no different than those present in the separated components,            the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change. Such a solution is called an            ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which            closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities            comprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.
When containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to            diffusion and form a solution. The formation of this solution clearly involves an            increase in disorder, since the helium and argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as            that which each occupied before mixing.
This example illustrates how diffusion alone can provide the driving force required to            cause the spontaneous formation of a solution.
Three types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process:                  solute-solute, solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in the diagram below,                  the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process in which energy is                  consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic                  processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic                  process referred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes                  associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process                  overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the                  energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater than the                  energy released by solvation.
For example, cooking oils and water will not mix to any appreciable extent to yield                  solutions. Hydrogen bonding is the dominant intermolecular attractive force present in                  liquid water; the nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules of cooking oils are not capable of                  hydrogen bonding, instead being held together by dispersion forces. Forming an oil-water                  solution would require overcoming the very strong hydrogen bonding in water, as well as                  the significantly strong dispersion forces between the relatively large oil molecules.                  And, since the polar water molecules and nonpolar oil molecules would not experience                  very strong intermolecular attraction, very little energy would be released by                  solvation.
On the other hand, a mixture of ethanol and water will mix in any proportions to yield a                  solution. In this case, both substances are capable of hydrogen bonding, and so the                  solvation process is sufficiently exothermic to compensate for the endothermic                  separations of solute and solvent molecules.
As noted, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by exothermic                  dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the                  release of heat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate                  (NH4NO3) is one such example and is used to make instant cold                  packs for treating injuries. A thin-walled plastic bag                  of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid NH4NO3. When the                  smaller bag is broken, a solution of NH4NO3 forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings                  (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that                  decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy                  input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated,                  but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies                  formation of the solution.

53,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Heating and Cooling Curves,"In the unit on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or            released by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature            change, \xceT, was introduced:
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,            but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a            temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat            is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of            increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a            change in state, its temperature remains constant.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply            heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the waters            temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant            despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is            maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to            provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the            boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase            transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state            is in progress.
The slide show below shows the change in temperature that occurs when a constant source            of heat is added to ice with an initial temperature of -10.0 oC. The resulting graph is            known as a heating curve.
How much heat is required to convert 135 g of ice at  C into water vapor at 120                C?
The transition described involves the following steps:
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in                phase) is: q = m  c  \xceT (see previous chapter on                thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given by q = n  \xceH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water,                and steam, and enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, we have:
Converting the quantities in J to kJ permits them to be summed, yielding the total                heat required:
The values below for water are used in the following example:
Calculate the heat required to convert 25.0 g solid ethanol at -135.0 oC                to liquid at 72.0 oC. Specific heat of solid ethanol = 0.97 J/g                    oC. Specific heat liquid ethanol 2.3 J/ g oC.

54,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Heat Capacity and Specific Heat,"Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorieunit of heat or other energy; the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius; 1 cal is defined as 4.184 J is the amount of            energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this            quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water.            The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is            still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used            in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and            energy is the jouleSI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of            1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James            Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is            also called 1 newtonmeter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its            definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

SI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal
We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change: heat            capacity and specific heat capacity.
The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of                            heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change                            (\xceT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):
Heat capacityextensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs                    or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive propertyits value is                    proportional to the amount of the substance.
extensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans.
The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small                    pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large                    pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more                    atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of                    those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan                    is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature                    of the pan by 50.0 C:
The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires                    90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 C. The larger pan has a                    (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material                    requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same                    temperature change:
The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its cspecific                            heat,d is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram                            of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):
Specific heat capacityintensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or                    releasing heat. It is an intensive propertythe type, but not the amount, of the                    substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a                    mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is                    therefore:
intensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can                    also calculate the specific heat of iron:
Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of                    the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the                    material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of                    energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from                    a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity,                    also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular                    substance and has units of J/mol C.",,what is the same as a kilojoule and a newtonmeter?,75.63496398925781
55,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,Introduction to Chemistry,"Chemistry is sometimes referred to as cthe central scienced due to its                    interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for                    areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).                    Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine,                    materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields.                  The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many                    aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines                    within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry.                    Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools                    that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the                    chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial                    to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living                    organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and                    nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce                    useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture,                    food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide                    sustenance in the form of food and drink to the worlds population. Medicine,                    pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that                    help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and                    atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand                    and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the                    universe in astronomy and cosmology.
What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and                    assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing,                    containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and                    other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you                    will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and                    structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their                    causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws                    involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the                    study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice                    of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens                    whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead                    to such changes.
Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and their changes. Chemists study and                    describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains:                    macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of                    considering and describing chemical behavior.
Macro is a Greek word that means clarge.d The macroscopic domain is familiar to                    us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed                    directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat                    and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday                    and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical                    properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability.
The microscopic domain of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination.                    Micro also comes from Greek and means csmall.d Some aspects of the microscopic                    domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite                    or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye,                    but when were suffering from a cold, were reminded of how real they are.
However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistrysuch as                    atoms and moleculesare too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and                    often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain                    include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of                    which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms                    in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual                    molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules                    into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms                    together are created.
The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent                    components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as                    those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are                    part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider                    calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important                    role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic                    domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the                    challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols                    can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and                    one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that                    must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.
A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous                    substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze                    to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher                    temperatures are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall                    into the microscopic domainwhat we cannot observe with the naked eye. The                    description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and                    the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these                    molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe                    water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the                    symbolic domain.

56,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Attractive Forces of Ionic Compounds,"Ionic substances are those in which the constituent atoms are joined with ionic                    bonds. Ionic bonds differ from covalent bonds in that ionic bonds involve one or                    more electrons being transferred from one atom to another rather than being                    shared between the two atoms. This type of bonding is observed between pairs of                    atoms that have a large electronegativity difference, like the alkali metals in                    the first column of the periodic table and the halogens, in group 17. The low                    electronegativity atom gives one or more electrons to the high electronegativity                    atom. This results in a positively charged cation and a negatively charged                    anion. In the image below we can see that atoms electronegativity increases                    from a minimum at the bottom left of the periodic table to a maximum at the top                    right (excluding the noble gases).
Because of the large differences in electronegativity, the force of attraction                    that holds an ionic compound together, the ionic bond, is very strong. The                    strength of attraction between the charged ions that make up an ionic compound                    are governed by Coulombs law.
in which F is the attractive force between two                            charged particles, k is a constant that depends                            on the type of crystal structure; q1                            and q2 are the charges on the ions;                            and r2 is the interionic distance                            (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions).
Note that the equation we looked at earlier to determine relative lattice                            energies is a variation of this same formula.
Lattice energy is directly related to the strength of attractive forces.                    Substances with larger lattice energy have stronger attractive forces.                    Therefore, in comparing the differences in boiling points of ionic substances,                    those with higher lattice energy will have higher boiling points.
Inter-ion force increases as ions get smaller because the negatively-charged                    electrons of one ion are closer to the positively-charged nucleus of the other                    ion. As radii of ions decrease the attractive forces increase and therefore                    boiling points increase. We can see this in the table below, which compares the                    boiling points of RbI, RbBr, and RbCl.
Coulomb\'s law, which measures the strength of attractive forces between charged                    particles also incorporates the magnitude of charge of each of the charged                    particles. As the magnitude of charges of the ions within an ionic compounds                    increase, the lattice energy increases and likewise the attractive force between                    the ions and the boiling point of the compound will increase. For example, NaF                    and CaO have distances between their nuclei of 1.18  and 1.20  , respectively.                    With a very small difference in the sizes, we might expect their boiling points                    to be likewise close in value. However, the boiling point of CaO is                    significantly larger at 2850 oC compared to that of NaF at 1695                        oC. This is due to the charges of the ions; CaO with charges of                    +2 and -2, while NaF has charges of +1 and -1. It is also important to note that                    the magnitude of charge generally has a more significant impact on boiling point                    compared to the size of ions. The illustration below shows atomic and ionic                    radii of select elements.

57,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions,"Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated                    that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same                    proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions(also, law of constant composition) all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass                    or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of                    the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent                    with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a                    component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system)                    are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1,                    as shown in table below.
(also, law of constant composition) all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportions by mass
It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the                    same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have                    the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there                    are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass                    ratio of 5.33:1.00.
Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments,                    to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportionswhen two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers states                    that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one                    element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole                    numbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid                    with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown                    crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These                    ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative;                    however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly                    surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.
when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small whole numbers
\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{1.116\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{Cl}}{1\\;\\mathrm                        g\\;\\mathrm{Cu}}}{\\displaystyle\\frac{0.558\\;\\mathrm                        g\\;\\mathrm{Cl}}{1\\;\\mathrm g\\;\\mathrm{Cu}}}\\;=\\;\
This 2-to-1 ratio means that the brown compound has twice the amount of chlorine                    per amount of copper as the green compound.
This can be explained by atomic theory if the copper-to-chlorine ratio in the                    brown compound is 1 copper atom to 2 chlorine atoms, and the ratio in the green                    compound is 1 copper atom to 1 chlorine atom. The ratio of chlorine atoms (and                    thus the ratio of their masses) is therefore 2 to 1.
A sample of compound X (a clear, colorless, combustible liquid with a                        noticeable odor) is analyzed and found to contain 14.13 g carbon and 2.96 g                        hydrogen. A sample of compound Y (a clear, colorless, combustible liquid                        with a noticeable odor that is slightly different from Xs odor) is analyzed                        and found to contain 19.91 g carbon and 3.34 g hydrogen. Are these data an                        example of the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple proportions,                        or neither? What do these data tell you about substances X and Y?
In compound X, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
In compound Y, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
The ratio of these ratios is:
This small, whole-number ratio supports the law of multiple proportions. This means that X and Y are different compounds.

58,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Lewis Structures,"We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in            Lewis structures, drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions.            For example, when two chlorine atoms form a chlorine molecule, they share one pair of            electrons:
The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not            used in bonding (called                 lone pairs                                                            two (a pair of) valence electrons that are not used to form a covalent                            bond                                                ) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line)            is sometimes used to indicate a shared pair of electrons:
two (a pair of) valence electrons that are not used to form a covalent                            bond
A single shared pair of electrons is called a                 single bond                                                            bond in which a single pair of electrons is shared between two atoms                                                . Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six in the lone pairs            and the two in the single bond.
bond in which a single pair of electrons is shared between two atoms
The other halogen molecules (F2, Br2, I2, and                        At2) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single                    bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each                    halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main                    group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons (or 2 valence                    electrons in the 1st shell) is known as the octet rule, as discussed                    previously.
The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number                    of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is                    especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C,                    N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in                    its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an                    octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as                    illustrated here for carbon in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH4                    (silane). Hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, which is                    the first shell. It has one valence electron so it forms one covalent bond to                    obtain the noble gas configuration of helium.
Group 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic                    Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet,                    these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in NH3 (ammonia). Oxygen                    and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds.                    Fluorine and other atoms in group 17 obtain an octet by forming one covalent                    bond.
As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we                    call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than                    one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A                         double bond                                                                                    bond in which two pairs of electrons is shared between two                                    atoms                                                                         forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms,                    as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in CH2O (formaldehyde) and                    between the two carbon atoms in C2H4 (ethylene):

59,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Lone Pairs of Electrons and Bond Angles,"Small distortions from the ideal angles can result from differences in repulsion between            various regions of electron density. In the following activity you will observe the            differences in bond angles between molecules that have the same electron-pair geometry,            but different numbers of lone pairs of electrons and therefore different molecular            shapes.
If you would like to open the simulation in a separate tab, click this                    link:Molecular                    Shapes
Open the simulation and choose ""Real Molecules."" In the ""Name"" section check                ""Molecule Geometry"" and ""Electron Geometry."" In the ""Options"" section check ""Show                Bond Angles."" Choose each of the molecules in the table below and fill in the                appropriate information. Note you may have to move the molecules around a bit to see                the bond angles clearly. Observe the molecules with and without viewing the lone                pairs of electrons by checking and unchecking ""Show Lone Pairs"" in the ""Options""                section.            
As seen in the activity above in the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached            to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal planar molecular structure,            but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramidal with the nitrogen atom at the apex            and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal            pyramidal shape are based on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are            slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy larger regions of space than            do bonding electrons. The HNH bond angles in NH3 are slightly smaller than the 109.5            angle in a regular tetrahedral shape such as that of CH4 because the lone pair-bonding            pair repulsion is greater than the bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion.
Small distortions from the ideal angles result from differences in repulsion between            various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by            establishing an order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by            different kinds of electron pairs. The order of electron-pair repulsions from greatest            to least repulsion is:
lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair
This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of            electrons. A lone pair of electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons            in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy more space than those in a            double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is:
lone pair > triple bond > double bond > single bond
Consider formaldehyde, H2CO, which is used as a preservative for biological            and anatomical specimens (Figure). This molecule has regions of high electron density            that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The basic geometry is trigonal            planar with 120 bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger            angles (121), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118).
The table below summarizes the content you explored previously. It is included here for            reference and convenience.
According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in the table above) are            equivalent within the linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries            (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which X is replaced with a lone            pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal            electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in            diagram below: an axial position (if we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two            axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the model) and an equatorial            position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). The axial            position is surrounded by bond angles of 90, whereas the equatorial position has more            space available because of the 120 bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair            geometry, lone pairs always occupy equatorial positions because these more spacious            positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs. Theoretically, we can come            up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF3            molecule. The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial            locations, giving a T-shaped molecular structure.
When a central atom has two lone electron pairs and four bonding regions, we have an            octahedral electron-pair geometry. The two lone pairs are on opposite sides of the            octahedron (180 apart), giving a square planar molecular structure that minimizes lone            pair-lone pair repulsions.

60,Gases,Gas Laws,Measuring Gas Pressure,"We can measure atmospheric pressure, theforce exerted by the atmosphere on the earths surface, with a barometer. Abarometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatileliquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of thatliquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, thecolumn of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquidsurface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in thetube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.
If the liquid is water, normal atmosphericpressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is ratherinconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury (Hg) is about.6-times denser than water, a mercury barometer only needs to be .6 as tall as a water barometera more suitable size. Standardatmospheric pressure of 1 atm at sea level (101,325 Pa) corresponds to a columnof mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high.
A manometer is a device similar to abarometer that can be used to measure the pressure of a gas trapped in acontainer. An open-end manometer is a U-shaped tube with one arm open to theatmosphere, one arm that connects to the gas to be measured, and a nonvolatileliquid (usually mercury) in between. The distance between the liquid levelscorresponds to the difference in pressure between the gas in the container andthe atmosphere.
Calculate the pressure of the gas in the manometer pictured below in units ofkPa. Atmospheric pressure is determined to be 100.5 kPa.
In order to use the equation Pgas = Patm  h, the height and the atmosphericpressure need to be in the same units. Since we want our final answer inunits of kPa, we will convert 53 mmHg to kPa and then use the equation.
Now we can apply the equation:

61,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Molecular Velocities and Kinetic Energy,"The previous discussion showed that the KMTqualitatively explains the behaviors described by the various gas laws. The postulatesof this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individuallaws. To do this, we must first look at velocities and kinetic energies of gasmolecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.
In a gas sample, individual molecules have widelyvarying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules and collisionsinvolved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. Thismolecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and itdepicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a givenspeed.
The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds. Thenumber of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a maximum, which isthe most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, \xce\xbdp, is a little less than 400 m/s, while the root mean square speed, urms,is closer to 500 m/s.
The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass (m)and speed (u) is given by:
\\mathrm{KE} = \ mu^2
Expressing mass in kilograms and speed in metersper second will yield energy values in units of joules (J = kg m 2 s-2). To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages forboth speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT, the root mean square velocity of a particle,urms , is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of thevelocities with n = the number of particles:

The average kinetic energy, KE avg , isthen equal to:
\\mathrm{KE}_\\mathrm{avg} = \ mu^2_\\mathrm{rms}
Where m is the mass of an individual molecule ofgas in kg. Assuming we are dealing with one mole of molecules of a gas we can derive thefollowing equation:
u_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3\\ RT}{M}}
Where M is the molar mass of the gas in units ofkg/mol.
The KEavg of a collection of gasmolecules is also directly proportional to the temperature of the gas and may bedescribed by the equation:
\\mathrm{KE}_\\mathrm{avg} = \ RT
where R is the gas constant and T is the kelvintemperature. (*Note that in this equation only temperature affects average kineticenergy. Any gas at the same temperature will have the same average kinetic energy.) Whenused in this equation, the appropriate form of the gas constant is 8.314 J/K mol (8.314kg m2 s-2 K-1 mol-1 ). These twoseparate equations for KE avg may be combined and rearranged to yield arelation between molecular speed and temperature:
\ mu^2_\\mathrm{rms} = \ RT
u_{rms}\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}M}
If the temperature of a gas increases, its KEavg increases, more molecules have higher speeds and fewer molecules havelower speeds, and the distribution shifts toward higher speeds overall, that is, to theright. If temperature decreases, KEavg decreases, more molecules have lowerspeeds and fewer molecules have higher speeds, and the distribution shifts toward lowerspeeds overall, that is, to the left. This behavior is illustrated for nitrogen gasbelow.
At a given temperature, all gases have the same KEavg for their molecules. Gases composed of lighter molecules have morehigh-speed particles and a higher urms , with a speed distribution thatpeaks at relatively higher velocities. Gases consisting of heavier molecules have morelow-speed particles, a lower urms , and a speed distribution that peaks atrelatively lower velocities.

62,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Mole Fraction and Molality,"Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were            introduced earlier, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications.            For example, molarity (M) is a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations,            since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute species:
Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary.            When expressed as molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of            solute and solvent species will be different at different temperatures, due to the            contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving many            colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent            on temperature. Two such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous unit on            gases) and molality.
The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the                    total number of moles of all solution components:
Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of                    solute to the mass of the solvent in kilograms:
Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with            temperature and, thus, are better suited for applications requiring            temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative properties, as            will be described in this module.
The antifreeze in most automobile radiators is a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene                glycol and water, with minor amounts of other additives that prevent corrosion. What                are the (a) mole fraction and (b) molality of ethylene glycol,                    C2H4(OH)2, in a solution prepared from 2.22                     103 g of ethylene glycol and 2.00  103 g of water                (approximately 2 L of glycol and 2 L of water)?
(a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar                amounts of both solution components and then substituting these amounts into the                unit definition.
Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties                with identical units (moles).
(b) To find molality, we need to know the moles of the solute and the mass of the                solvent (in kg).
First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of                solute:
Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms:
Finally, calculate molarity per its definition:
Calculate the mole fraction of solute and solvent in a 2.80 m solution of sodium                chloride.
Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing                the two unit definitions. In this case, both units have the same numerator (moles of                solute) but different denominators. The provided molal concentration may be written                as:
The numerator for this solutions mole fraction is, therefore, 2.80 mol NaCl. The                denominator may be computed by deriving the molar amount of water corresponding to                1.00 kg
and then substituting these molar amounts into the definition for mole fraction.
Note that the sum of the mole fraction of NaCl and the mole fraction of H2O is 1 (0.952 + 0.0480 = 1.000). This is true in general - the sum of the mole fractions of the solution components always equals 1.

63,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Quantum Mechanics,"Werner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure                    properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that                    there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particles                    position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the                    momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at                    that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg                    uncertainty principle.
It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the                    momentum and the position of a particle.
For a particle of mass m moving with velocity vx in the x direction (or equivalently with momentum px), the product of the uncertainty in the                    position, \xcex, and the uncertainty in the momentum, \xcepx, must be                    greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{\\mathitf}{\}\\) (recall that                    \\(\\mathitf=\\;\\frac h{2\\pi}\\), the value of Plancks constant divided by 2).
\\Delta x \imes \\Delta p_x = (\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq                    \\frac{\\hbar}2
This equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both                    the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we                    improve our measurement of an electrons position so that the uncertainty in the                    position (\xcex) has a value of, say, 1 pm                    (10-12 m, about 1% of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our                    determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at                    least
\\left[ \\Delta p = m \\Delta v = \\frac{h}{2 \\Delta x} \ight] =                    \\frac{(1.055 \imes 10^{-34} \\mathrm{kg}\\                    \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s})}{(2\\^{-12}\\mathrm{m})} = 5 \imes                    10^{-23} \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}
The value of h is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a                    macroscopic object like a baseball is too insignificant to observe. However, the                    mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the                    uncertainty can be large and significant.
Heisenbergs principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.                    The uncertainty principle can be shown to be a consequence of waveparticle                    duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory                    from classical mechanics. Recall that the equations of motion obtained from                    classical mechanics are trajectories where, at any given instant in time, both                    the position and the momentum of a particle can be determined exactly.                    Heisenbergs uncertainty principle implies that such a view is untenable in the                    microscopic domain and that there are fundamental limitations governing the                    motion of quantum particles. This does not mean that microscopic particles do                    not move in trajectories, it is just that measurements of trajectories are                    limited in their precision. In the realm of                         quantum mechanics                                                                                    field of study that includes quantization of energy,                                    wave-particle duality, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle                                    to describe matter                                                                        , measurements introduce changes into the system that is being                    observed.

Shortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom                    could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a                    particle moving in quantized circular orbits, as Bohr had argued, Erwin                    Schrdinger extended de Broglies work by incorporating the de Broglie relation                    into a wave equation, deriving what is today known as the Schrdinger equation.                    When Schrdinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to                    reproduce Bohrs expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula                    governing hydrogen spectra, and he did so without having to invoke Bohrs                    assumptions of stationary states and quantized orbits, angular momenta, and                    energies; quantization in Schrdingers theory was a natural consequence of the                    underlying mathematics of the wave equation.
Like de Broglie, Schrdinger initially viewed the electron in hydrogen as being a                    physical wave instead of a particle, but where de Broglie thought of the                    electron in terms of circular stationary waves, Schrdinger properly thought in                    terms of three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by                    the Greek letter psi, . A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation                    of the                         wavefunction                                                                                     mathematical description of an atomic orbital that describes the                                    shape of the orbital; it can be used to calculate the                                    probability of finding the electron at any given location in the                                    orbital, as well as dynamical variables such as the energy and                                    the angular momentum                                                                         that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the                    waves represented by  are not physical waves but, instead, are complex                    probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction                     describes the probability of the quantum particle being                    present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be                    used to determine the distribution of the electrons density with respect to the                    nucleus in an atom. The general form of the Schrdinger equation is seen                    below.

Schrdingers work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists                    following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.

64,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Sigma and Pi Bonds,"In addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also            affects their overlap (other than for two s orbitals, which are spherically symmetric).            Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a            direct line between the two nuclei. The diagrams below illustrates this for two p            orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to            end rather than at an angle.
The overlap of two s orbitals (as in H2), the overlap of an s orbital and a p            orbital (as in HCl), and the end-to-end overlap of two p orbitals (as in Cl2)            all produce sigma bonds ( bonds), as illustrated below. A  bond is a covalent bond in            which the electron density is concentrated in the region along the internuclear axis;            that is, a line between the nuclei would pass through the center of the overlap region.            Single bonds in Lewis structures are described as  bonds in valence bond theory.
A pi bond ( bond) is a type of covalent bond that results from the side-by-side overlap            of two p orbitals, as illustrated below. In a  bond, the regions of orbital overlap lie            on opposite sides of the internuclear axis. Along the axis itself, there is a node, that            is, a plane with no probability of finding an electron.
While all single bonds are  bonds, multiple bonds consist of both  and  bonds. As the            Lewis structures suggest, O2 contains a double bond, and N2            contains a triple bond. The double bond consists of one  bond and one  bond, and the            triple bond consists of one  bond and two  bonds. Between any two atoms, the first            bond formed will always be a  bond, but there can only be one  bond in any one            location. In any multiple bond, there will be one  bond, and the remaining one or two            bonds will be  bonds. These bonds are described in more detail later in this            module.
As seen in the table on the previous page, an average carbon-carbon single bond is 347            kJ/mol, while in a carbon-carbon double bond, the  bond increases the bond strength by            267 kJ/mol. Adding an additional  bond causes a further increase of 225 kJ/mol. We can            see a similar pattern when we compare other  and  bonds. Thus, each individual  bond            is generally weaker than a corresponding  bond between the same two atoms. In a  bond,            there is a greater degree of orbital overlap than in a  bond.
Butadiene, C4H6, is used to make synthetic rubber. Identify the number of  and                 bonds contained in this molecule.
There are six  CH bonds and one  CC bond, for a total of seven from the single                bonds. There are two double bonds that each have a  bond in addition to the  bond.                This gives a total nine  and two  bonds overall.

65,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,The Mole,"The moleamount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12 is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It            provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of            matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of            discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a            sample of pure 12C weighing exactly 12 g. The mole provides                a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely                important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.
amount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12
The number of entities composing a mole is defined to be            6.02214179×1023, a fundamental constant named Avogadros number                (NA)defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo            Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of cper mole,d a            conveniently rounded version being 6.022×1023/mol.
defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole
Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the            same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. For example 1 mole of carbon            contains 6.022×1023 atoms of carbon and 1 mole of phosphorus contains 6.022×1023             atoms of phosphorus. The masses of 1 mole of different elements,            however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically            different. The molar massmass in grams of 1 mole of a substance of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of            that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). Because the            definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference            substance, 12C, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to            its atomic or formula weight in amu. The molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol (same value            as its atomic mass) and the molar mass of phosphorus is 30.97 g/mol (same value as its            atomic mass).
mass in grams of 1 mole of a substance
While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are            vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the            magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the            mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g. Although this represents            just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (approximately 18 g), it contains more water            molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among            the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100            billion molecules.
As we discussed, the molar mass of an element is numerically the same value as                    the atomic mass of that element listed on the periodic table. Likewise, the                    molar mass of a compound is numerically the same value as the formula mass for                    that compound. For example, the formula mass of NaCl is 58.44 amu. Therefore the                    molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g and the number of NaCl units is 6.022×1023.                         The formula mass of water H2O is 18.02 amu.                    Therefore the molar mass of water is 18.02 g and the number of water molecules                    in one mole of water is 6.022×1023.
*Note that one unit of a molecular(covalent) compound is referred to as a                    molecule. However, one unit of a ionic compound is referred to as a formula                    unit.

66,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Types of Crystalline Solids,"Crystalline solids are generally classified according the nature of the forces that hold            its particles together. These forces are primarily responsible for the physical            properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections provide descriptions of            the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and            molecular.
Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive                    and negative ions that are held together by electrostatic attractions, which can                    be quite strong. Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due                    to the very strong attractions between the ionsin ionic compounds, the                    attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the                    partial charges in polar molecular compounds. Although they are hard, they also                    tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not                    conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because                    their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a                    metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.
Metallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by                    metal atoms. The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform                    distribution of atomic nuclei within a csead of delocalized electrons. The atoms                    within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as                    metallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All                    exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and                    malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability                    (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and,                    therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting points of the metals                    vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt                    below 200 C. Several post-transition metals also have low melting points,                    whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above 1000 C. These                    differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the                    metals.
Covalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other                    nonmetals, and some covalent compounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and                    silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have                    networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a                    network of covalent bonds, as shown below. To break or to melt a covalent                    network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds are                    relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by                    hardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the                    hardest substances known and melts above 3500 C.
Molecular solids, such as ice, sucrose (table sugar), and iodine, as shown below                    , are composed of neutral molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces                    between the units present in different crystals vary widely, as indicated by the                    melting points of the crystals. Small symmetrical molecules (nonpolar                    molecules), such as H2, N2, O2, and                        F2, have weak attractive forces and form molecular solids with                    very low melting points (below  C). Substances consisting of larger,                    nonpolar molecules have larger attractive forces and melt at higher                    temperatures. Molecular solids composed of molecules with permanent dipole                    moments (polar molecules) melt at still higher temperatures. Examples include                    ice (melting point, 0 C) and table sugar (melting point, 185 C).

67,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions: Mass and Volume of Solution,"The examples on the previous page illustrate the ease with which the amounts of                      substances involved in a chemical reaction of known stoichiometry may be related.                      Directly measuring numbers of atoms and molecules is, however, not practical when                      working the the macroscopic world. A much more practical application of stoichiometry                      requires that we use the more readily measured property of mass.
What mass of sodium hydroxide, NaOH, would be required to produce 16 g of the antacid                          milk of magnesia [magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2] by the following                          reaction?
The approach used previously is likewise used here; that is, we must derive an                          appropriate stoichiometric factor from the balanced chemical equation and use it to                          relate the amounts of the two substances of interest. In this case, however, masses                          (not molar amounts) are provided and requested, so additional steps are required.                          The calculations required are outlined in this flowchart:
It is also common to encounter stoichiometric problems where you are given the volume and                     concentration of solution involved in a given reaction.
When an aqueous solution sodium hydroxide is mixed with an aqueous solution of                         copper(II) chloride, a precipitate of copper(II) hydroxide forms as seen in the                         equation below.
If 15 mL of a 0.75 M solution of NaOH is reacted with an excess amount of                         CuCl2, what mass of precipitate will form?
The approach used previously is likewise used here; that is, we must derive an                         appropriate stoichiometric factor from the balanced chemical equation and use it to                         relate the amounts of the two substances of interest. In this case, however, volume                         and concentration of solution (not molar amounts) are provided and mass is                         requested. The calculations required are outlined in this flowchart:
Our first step is to convert to moles, as it was previously. However, the amount                         given is not the mass of the substance so we will not use the molar mass to make                         this conversion. We will use the volume and concentration of solution to determine                         the moles of NaOH involved in this reaction.
Rearranging the molarity equation:
We substitute the given concentration and volume to determine the amount of moles                          NaOH.
Now that we know moles of NaOH, we can set up dimensional analysis to calculate mass of                         Cu(OH)2.
You can use the following generalized flow chart to help to determine the steps to                     calculate the amount of any substance (B) in a chemical reaction, given an amount of any                     other substance (A) in the reaction.

68,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Waves,"Electromagnetic energy travels through space in waves. So understanding wave            characteristics is important in understanding electromagnetic energy. A wave is an            oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to            another. Common examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers            energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes            waves to ripple outward along the water\'s surface, and the expansion of air that            accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward            for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter            (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place.
Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. Electromagnetic waves consist of            an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which            are perpendicular to the direction of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at            a constant speed of \\(2.998\^8\\) m/s, the speed of light (denoted by c).
All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by: a            wavelength (denoted by \xce\xbb, the lowercase Greek letter lambda); a frequency (denoted by \xce\xbd,            the lowercase Greek letter nu); and an amplitude (denoted by A). As can be seen in diagrams below, the            wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured            in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an            enormous range - wavelengths of kilometers (103 m) to picometers            (10-12 m) have been observed. The frequency (the rate of oscillation) is the number of wave cycles            that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system,            time is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit            for frequency, expressed as cycles per second (s), is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples            of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = \\(1\^6\\) Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = \\(1\^9\\)            Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave\'s            displacement and so, as shown in the figure below, this corresponds to one-half the height between the            peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for            light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness. Brighter lights have a greater amplitude than dimmer lights and louder sounds have a greater amplitude than quieter sounds.
The product of a wave\'s wavelength (\xce\xbb) and its frequency (\xce\xbd), \xce\xbb\xce\xbd, is the speed of the                    wave. For electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum:
c\\;=\\;\\lambda\u
where c is the speed at which electromagnetic energy travels (\\(2.998\^8\\)>                    m/s).
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: as the wavelength increases, the            frequency decreases. The inverse proportionality is illustrated in figure below. This            figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of            electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific            frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light            makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies            developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for            reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for            different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as            frequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified            in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms).
A sodium streetlight gives off yellow light that has a wavelength of 589 nm \\(1\\;\\mathrm{nm}\\;=\\;1\^{-9}\\;\\mathrm m\\). What is the frequency of this light?
We can rearrange the equation c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd to solve for the frequency:
\u=\\frac c\\lambda\\;
Since c is expressed in meters per second, we must also convert 589 nm to meters.
\equire{cancel}\u=\\left(\\frac{2.998\^8\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm m}\\mathrm s^{-1}}{589\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{nm}}}\ight)\\left(\\frac{1\^9\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{nm}}}{1\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm m}}\ight)\\;=\\;5.09\^{14}\\;\\mathrm s^{-1}

70,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Module Summary and Quiz,"Some substances form crystalline solids consisting of particles in a very organized                structure; others form amorphous (noncrystalline) solids with an internal structure that                is not ordered. The main types of crystalline solids are ionic solids, metallic solids,                covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of                crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the                arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them.                Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have                distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of                interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures.

71,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Diffusion and Effusion of Gases,"If you have ever been in a room when a piping hot pizza was delivered, you have been madeaware of the fact that gaseous molecules can quickly spread throughout a room, asevidenced by the pleasant aroma that soon reaches your nose. Although gaseous moleculestravel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with othergaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desiredtarget. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisionsper second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels betweencollisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the meanfree path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of themolecule.
In general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closedcontainer, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process bywhich molecules disperse in space in response to differences in concentration is calleddiffusion (shown in Figure). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware ofany concentration gradient, they simply move randomlyregions of higher concentrationhave more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement ofspecies from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment,diffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, as depictedbelow. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrationsare the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no nettransfer of molecules occurs).
We are often interested in the rate of diffusion, the amount of gas passing through somearea per unit time:
\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ diffusion} = \\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ of\\ gas\\ passing\\through\\ an\\ area}}{\\mathrm{unit\\ of\\ time}}
The diffusion rate depends on several factors: the concentration gradient (the increaseor decrease in concentration from one point to another); the amount of surface areaavailable for diffusion; and the distance the gas particles must travel. Note also thatthe time required for diffusion to occur is inversely proportional to the rate ofdiffusion, as shown in the rate of diffusion equation.
A process involving movement of gaseous species similar to diffusion is effusion, theescape of gas molecules through a tiny hole such as a pinhole in a balloon into a vacuum(Figure). Although diffusion and effusion rates both depend on the molar mass of the gasinvolved, their rates are not equal; however, the ratios of their rates are the same.
If a mixture of gases is placed in a container with porous walls, the gases effusethrough the small openings in the walls. The lighter gases pass through the smallopenings more rapidly (at a higher rate) than the heavier ones (Figure). In 1832, ThomasGraham studied the rates of effusion of different gases and formulated Grahams law ofeffusion.
The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of themass of its particles:
\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion} \\propto\{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}}}
This means that if two gases A and B are at the same temperature and pressure, theratio of their effusion rates is inversely proportional to the ratio of the squareroots of the masses of their particles:
\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ A}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\B}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{B}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{A}}}
Calculate the ratio of the rate of effusion of hydrogen to the rate of effusion ofoxygen.
\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ hydrogen}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ oxygen}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{32.0\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}}{\\sqrt{2.0\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{16}}{\\sqrt{1}} = \
Hydrogen effuses four times as rapidly as oxygen.
Heres another example, making the point about how determining times differs fromdetermining rates.
It takes 243 s for 4.46  10 mol Xe to effuse through a tiny hole. Underthe same conditions, how long will it take 4.46  10 mol Ne toeffuse?
It is important to resist the temptation to use the times directly, and to rememberhow rate relates to time as well as how it relates to mass. Recall the definition ofrate of effusion:
\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ diffusion} = \\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ of\\ gas\\ passing\\through\\ an\\ area}}{\\mathrm{unit\\ of\\ time}}
and combine it with Graham\'s law:
\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ Xe}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\Ne}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Ne}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Xe}}}
\\frac{\\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ Xe\\ transferred}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\Xe}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{amount\\ Ne\\ transferred}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne}}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Ne}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Xe}}}
Noting that amount of A = amount of B, and solving for time for Ne:
\equire{cancel} \\frac{\\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{amount\\ Xe\\transferred}}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Xe}}}{\\frac{\\cancel{\\mathrm{amount\\ Ne\\transferred}}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\Ne}}{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Xe}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Ne}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{Xe}}}
and substitute values:
\\frac{\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne}}{243 \\mathrm{s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{20.2\\\\mathrm{g/mol}}{131.3\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}}} = 0.392
Finally, solve for the desired quantity:
\\mathrm{time\\ for\\ Ne} = 0.392 \imes 243\\ \\mathrm{s} = 95.3\\ \\mathrm{s}
Note that this answer is reasonable: Since Ne is lighter than Xe, the effusion ratefor Ne will be larger than that for Xe, which means the time of effusion for Ne willbe smaller than that for Xe.
The following example demonstrates how comparing the effusion rate of an unknown gas tothat of a known gas can be used to calculate the molar mass of the unknown gas.
An unknown gas effuses 1.66 times more rapidly than CO2. What is the molar mass ofthe unknown gas? Can you make a reasonable guess as to its identity?
From Graham\'s law, we have:
\\frac{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\ effusion\\ of\\ unknown}}{\\mathrm{rate\\ of\\effusion\\ of\\ CO_2}} =\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{\\sqrt{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{unknown}}}
Plug in known data:
\\frac{1.66}1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{44.0\\mathrm{g/mol}}}{\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{unknown}}
Solve:
\\mathscr{M}_\\mathrm{unknown} = \\frac{44.0 \\mathrm{g/mol}}{(1.66)^2} = 16.0\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}
The gas could well be CH4, the only gas with this molar mass.

72,Solutions,Solubility,Electrolytes,"As discussed in an earlier unit, when some substances are dissolved in water they yield            ions in solution. These substances constitute an important class of compounds called            electrolytes. Substances that do not yield ions when dissolved are called            nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is            essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the            substance is known as a strong electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the            dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a weak            electrolyte.
Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the            electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct            electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is            the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged            entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved            ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to            electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of            dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or            qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit .
Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions. The electrostatic                    attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole                    attraction. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic                    compounds in water.
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and                    disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and                    solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This                    process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most                    conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,                    and so they are classified as strong electrolytes.
Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to                    water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water                    molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they                    attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water                    molecules penetrate between individual K+ and Cl ions and                    surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together                    and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as seen in the                    illustration below. The reduction of the electrostatic attraction permits the                    independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution, resulting in an                    increase in the disorder of the system as the ions change from their fixed and                    ordered positions in the crystal to mobile and much more disordered states in                    solution. This increased disorder is responsible for the dissolution of many                    ionic compounds, including KCl, which dissolve with absorption of heat.
In other cases, the electrostatic attractions between the ions in a crystal are                    so large, or the ion-dipole attractive forces between the ions and water                    molecules are so weak, that the increase in disorder cannot compensate for the                    energy required to separate the ions, and the crystal is insoluble. Such is the                    case for compounds such as calcium carbonate (limestone), calcium phosphate (the                    inorganic component of bone), and iron oxide (rust).
Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very                    slightly ionizedonly about two out of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25                    C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton (H+                    ion) to another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions.
In some cases, we find that solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct                    electricity because the solute molecules react chemically with the solvent to                    produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of                    covalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, when we dissolve                    hydrogen chloride in water, we find that the solution is a very good conductor.                    The water molecules play an essential part in forming ions: Solutions of                    hydrogen chloride in many other solvents, such as benzene, do not conduct                    electricity and do not contain ions.
Hydrogen chloride is an acid, and so its molecules react with water, transferring                    H+ ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) and chloride ions (Cl):
This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a strong acid                    and, consequently, a strong electrolyte). Likewise, weak acids and bases that                    only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when                    dissolved in water and are classified as weak electrolytes.

73,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Standard Enthalpy of Formation,"Standard enthalpies of formation provide a convenient means to calculate the enthalpy of            reactions. A standard enthalpy of formation,                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                , of a pure substance is the enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1            mole of that substance is formed from the elements in their most stable states under            standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or            predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to            carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have            values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the            enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hesss            law.
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is .5 kJ/mol. This is the            enthalpy change for the reaction that forms CO2(g) from the elements:
The reactants are the elements in their cstandard statesd, which is the most stable form            of the element at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 C. For the element carbon, the standard            state is graphite, because this is the most stable form of carbon under at 1 atm and 25            C. For oxygen, the standard state is O2(g). The product of the formation            reaction is one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 C. For nitrogen dioxide,                NO2(g),                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                                     is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
A reaction equation with 1/2 mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is            correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole            of product, NO2(g).
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in            this  Table of Thermodynamic Properties. These values indicate that            formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as  kJ/mol for the formation            of P4O10) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the            formation of acetylene, C2H2). Note that the standard enthalpy of            formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero.
Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic                process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction                in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the                reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation,                                                                \xce                                                    H                            f                            o                                                                                     of ozone from the following information:

74,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,The Discovery of the Electron,"In the two centuries since Dalton developed his ideas, scientists have made                    significant progress in furthering our understanding of atomic theory. Much of                    this came from the results of several seminal experiments that revealed the                    details of the internal structure of atoms. Here, we will discuss some of those                    key developments, with an emphasis on application of the scientific method, as                    well as understanding how the experimental evidence was analyzed. While the                    historical persons and dates behind these experiments can be quite interesting,                    it is most important to understand the concepts resulting from their work.
If matter were composed of atoms, what were atoms composed of? Were they the                    smallest particles, or was there something smaller? In the late 1800s, a number                    of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical                    discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most                    significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode                    ray tube. Review the slideshow below to learn about Thomson\'s cathode ray                    experiments.
Although controversial at the time, Thomsons idea was gradually accepted, and                    his cathode ray particle is what we now call an electronA negatively charged subatomic particle., a negatively charged,                    subatomic particle with a mass more than one thousand-times less that of an                    atom. The term celectrond was coined in 1891 by Irish physicist George Stoney,                    from celectric ion.d
A negatively charged subatomic particle.
In 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist                    Robert A. Millikan via his coil dropd experiments. Millikan created microscopic                    oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or                    by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their                    downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in                    the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful                    measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the                    charge on individual drops.
Looking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that                    the charge of an oil droplet is always a multiple of a specific charge, 1.6 X                        10 C. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a                    fundamental chargethe charge of a single electronwith his measured charges due                    to an excess of one electron (1 times 1.6 X 10 C), two electrons                    (2 times 1.6 X 10 C), three electrons (3 times 1.6 X                        10 C), and so on, on a given oil droplet. Since the charge of                    an electron was now known due to Millikans research, and the charge-to-mass                    ratio was already known due to Thomsons research (1.759 X 1011                    C/kg), it only required a simple calculation to determine the mass of the                    electron as well.
Scientists had now established that the atom was not indivisible as Dalton had                    believed, and due to the work of Thomson, Millikan, and others, the charge and                    mass of the negative, subatomic particlesthe electronswere known. However, the                    positively charged part of an atom was not yet well understood. In 1904, Thomson                    proposed the cplum puddingd model of atoms, which described a positively charged                    mass with an equal amount of negative charge in the form of electrons embedded                    in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral.

75,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Calculating Formal Charge,"Previously, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. However, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal chargescharge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons) to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.
charge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons)
The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.
Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:
Formal Charge
We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.

76,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Gas Density and Molar Mass,"One important application of the ideal gas law is to determine its molar mass and thereby            assist in its identification using the measured density of the gas. Review the            interactive below to see the derivation of the formula used to calculate the molar mass            of a gas from its density.
Press ""NEXT"" to advance slide show.
The molar mass of a gas can be determined given its density, temperature, and pressure            with the following equation:
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
Where d = density, R = ideal gas law            constant, T = temperature, and P = pressure.
A gas was found to have a density of 0.0847 g/L at 17.0 C and a pressure of 760                torr. What is its molar mass? What is the gas?
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
As before when using the ideal gas law constant, we need to ensure that the units in                the constant match the units used for the other variables and as before when using                the ideal gas law equation temperature must be in K. First we will convert the                pressure to units of atm. You will recall that 760 torr = 1 atm.
\equire{cancel} \equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{(0.0847                    \\mathrm{g/}\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}})( 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(290                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}}
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = 2.02 \\mathrm{g/mol}
The gas is hydrogen, H2.
This equation can also be used to determine the density of a known gas at a given            temperature and pressure.
Calculate the density of chlorine gas (Cl2) at 22 oC and 735 torr.
We can use the molar mass of a gas equation,
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
rearranging it to solve for density.
\equire{mathrsfs} d = \\frac{\\mathscr{M}P}{RT}
Because we know the identity of the gas, we can easily calculate its molar mass and                substitute it and the other given values (making the necessary conversions) into the                equation.

                   Where c                   is the specific heat of the substance,                   m                   is its mass, and \xceT                   (which is read cdelta Td) is the temperature change,                   Tfinal  Tinitial.
If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is            higher than its initial temperature, Tfinal  Tinitial has a positive value, and the value of q is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its            temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, Tfinal  Tinitial            has a negative value, and the value of q is negative.
A flask containing 8.0  102 g of water is heated, and the temperature of                the water increases from 21 C to 85 C. How much heat did the water absorb?
To answer this question, consider these factors:
The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 C requires                4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 C, we                will need 800 times as much to heat 800 g of water by 1 C. Finally, we observe that                since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 C, we will need 64 times as                much to heat it by 64 C (that is, from 21 C to 85 C).
This can be summarized using the equation:

A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g. When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat,                its temperature increases from 22.4 C to 43.6 C. Determine the specific heat of                this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity).
Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine                its specific heat using the relationship:
Substituting the known values:
Solving:
Comparing this value with the values in the table of Specific Heats of Common                    Substances, this value matches the specific heat of aluminum,                which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.",,what's the relationship between the mass of a substance and its specific heat?,44.685829162597656
78,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Hybrid Atomic Orbitals,"Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how            chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with            more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example,            let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two            hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration                1s22s22p4, with two unpaired electrons (one in each            of the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two OH bonds form            from the overlap of these two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If            this were the case, the bond angle would be 90, as shown below, because p orbitals are            perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5,            not 90. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world            observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.
Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O            differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with            the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave            function, , contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of            electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave            functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes.            This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization            and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO,            (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are            called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital            and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule            differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward            the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals            should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5). The observed angle of 104.5 is            experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful            explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate            predictions.

79,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Intermolecular Forces Introduction,"We saw on the previous page that the conditions under which phase changes occur                    for ionic compounds are determined by the strength of the ionic bond that holds                    the ions together. For molecular compounds, it is strength of intermolecular forces (IMFs) that affect the                    conditions under which phase changes occur. In the rest of this module, we will explore three types of intermolecular forces:
Under appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will                    cause them to form liquids or solids. This is due to intermolecular forces, not                    intramolecular forces. Intramolecular forces are those within the molecule that                    keep the molecule together, the covalent bonds between the atoms discussed                    previously in this course. Intermolecular forces are the attractions between                    molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance. The                    diagram below illustrates these different molecular forces. The IMFs that exist                    between molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces (covalent                    bonds) that bond atoms together within a molecule. For example, to overcome the                    IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it into gaseous HCl requires only                    about 17 kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the hydrogen                    and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl requires about 25 times more energy                    kilojoules.
The conditions under which a phase change occurs for a molecular substance is                    determined by the strength of its IMF(s). The relative strengths of the covalent                    bonds of a molecular substance have no impact on melting point or boiling                    point.
Watch the videos. For each of the processes that is occurring,                        determine which type of attractive force is being broken and the energy                        required to overcome that force.

80,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Internal Energy,"Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or            removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms            or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased            translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or            molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the amplitudes of these motions decrease and the            kinetic energy falls. The total of all energy present in a substance, including both            kinetic and potential energy, is called the internal energy (E).            As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be            transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system.            A system is defined as the substance or substances undergoing chemical or physical            change of interest. The surroundings can be defined as everything else in the            universe.
The change in internal energy or E is                           defined by the equation below.
E is negative when the system releases energy to                           the surroundings. E is positive when                               the system gains energy from the surroundings.
Chemists use graphs to depict changes in internal energy. The vertical axis of                    these graphs represents the internal energy. Use the arrows below the following                    figures to see how such graphs represent processes in which a system loses or                    gains energy from the surroundings.
When the initial state of the system is greater than the final state of the                    system, due to the system losing energy to the surroundings, E is negative.
When the initial state of the system is lower than the final state of the system,                    due to the system gaining energy to the surroundings, E is positive.
Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat (q) from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (w) on the system. For example, energy is transferred                    into a room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire                    absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth                    (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes                    increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in                    the wires temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when                    heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the                    surroundings.
The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be                           represented by the equation:
where E is internal energy, q is heat, and w                           is work.
Chemists use the following sign conventions for q and w:
A strategy that you can use to remember this is to view the world from the                    system\'s perspective.
The sign of E specifies whether the process is                    exothermic or endothermic. If E < 0 the system has                    released energy to the surroundings and the process is exothermic. If E > 0 the system has absorbed energy from the                    surroundings and the process is endothermic.
This is a mathematical representation of the first law of thermodynamics. It                    shows that there are two ways to change the internal energy of a system: heat                    flow into or out of the system (positive q is heat flow                    in; negative q is heat flow out) and work done on or by                    the system ( positive w if work is done on the system and negative w if work                    is done by the system). Remember that energy is conserved: Energy can be                    transformed from one form to another and transferred from one substance to                    another, but it is neither created nor destroyed. Therefore, any decrease in                    internal energy of a system must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in                    internal energy of the surroundings, and vice versa.
A system absorbs 55 kJ of heat from its surroundings, while doing 13 kJ of work on                the surroundings. Calculate E and determine whether the                process is exothermic or endothermic.
Using the equation:
Heat is being absorbed by the system from the surroundings, therefore the value for                    q is positive.
Work is being done by the system on the surroundings, therefore the value for w is negative.
E is positive meaning more energy has flowed from the                surroundings to the system, therefore the process is endothermic.
The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as                        E = q + w. Internal energy is a type of quantity known as a state function (or                    state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a                    state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how                    that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value                    does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is                    altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at                    an altitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter whether you hiked there or                    parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however,                    is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a                    more roundabout, circuitous path. The distances traveled would differ (distance                    is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude                    is a state function).","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.",what is the relationship between the internal energy and the surroundings?,37.98419952392578
81,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Equations for Ionic Reactions,"Given the abundance of water on earth, it stands to reason that a great many chemical            reactions take place in aqueous media. When ions are involved in these reactions, the            chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail appropriate to their            intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking            place in an aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and                AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous                Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl:
This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation            because it doesnt explicitly represent the ionic species that are present in solution.            When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate into their constituent ions,            which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a            thorough discussion of this important process is provided later in the course). Ionic            compounds dissolved in water are, therefore, more realistically represented as            dissociated ions, in this case:
Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant            extent, as signified by its physical state notation, s.
Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this            particular case, the formulas for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas            for their dissociated ions:
Examining this equation shows that two chemical species are present in identical form on            both sides of the arrow, Ca2+(aq) and NO3(aq). These                 spectator ions                                                            An ion that remains unchanged from the reactant to the products side of                            an equation.                                                 ions whose presence is required to maintain charge neutralityare neither            chemically nor physically changed by the process, and so they may be eliminated from the            equation to yield a more succinct representation called a                 net ionic equation                                                            A chemical equation written such that all dissociated ions are shown as                            such in the equation.                                                :

Following the convention of using the smallest possible integers as coefficients, this            equation is then written:
This net ionic equation indicates that solid silver chloride may be produced from            dissolved chloride and silver(I) ions, regardless of the source of these ions. These            molecular and complete ionic equations provide additional information, namely, the ionic            compounds used as sources of Cl and Ag+.

Begin by identifying formulas for the reactants and products and arranging them                properly in chemical equation form:
Balance is achieved easily in this case by changing the coefficient for NaOH to 2,                resulting in the molecular equation for this reaction:
The two dissolved ionic compounds, NaOH and Na2CO3, can be                represented as dissociated ions to yield the complete ionic equation:
Finally, identify the spectator ion(s), in this case Na+(aq), and remove                it from each side of the equation to generate the net ionic equation:

82,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Ionic Radii,"Ionic radius is the measure used to describe thesize of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the same number of protons asthe parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived, as seen in thefigure below for the aluminum atom and ion. For example, the covalent radius of analuminum atom (1s22s22p63s23p1)is 118 pm, whereas the ionic radius of an Al3+(1s22s22p6) is 68 pm. As electrons are removed fromthe outer valence shell, the remaining core electrons occupying smaller shellsexperience a greater effective nuclear charge Zeff(as discussed previously) and are drawn even closer to the nucleus.
Cations with larger charges are smaller thancations with smaller charges (e.g., V2+ has an ionic radius of 79 pm, whilethat of V3+ is 64 pm). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, wefind that cations of successive elements with the same charge generally have largerradii, corresponding to an increase in the principal quantum number, n.
An anion (negative ion) is formed by the additionof one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This results in a greaterrepulsion among the electrons and a decrease in Zeffper electron. Both effects (the increased number of electrons and the decreased Zeff) cause the radius of an anion to be larger thanthat of the parent atom, as seen in the figure above for the sulfur atom and ion. Forexample, a sulfur atom ([Ne]3s23p4) has a covalent radius of 104pm, whereas the ionic radius of the sulfide anion ([Ne]3s23p6) is pm. For consecutive elements proceeding down any group, anions have larger principalquantum numbers and, thus, larger radii.
Atoms and ions that have the same electronconfiguration are said to be isoelectronic. Examples of isoelectronic species are N, O 2, F , Ne, Na+, Mg2+,and Al3+ (1s22s22p6). Another isoelectronicseries is P3, S2, Cl, Ar, K+,+, and Sc3+ ([Ne]3s23p6). For atomsor ions that are isoelectronic, the number of protons determines the size. The greaterthe nuclear charge, the smaller the radius in a series of isoelectronic ions and atoms

83,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ions,"Atoms are electrically neutral having the same number of protons and electrons. However,            under certain circumstances atoms can become electrically charged. When an atom becomes            electrically charged it is called an ionAn atom that has gained or lost electrons and therefore is electrically charged.. As will be discussed in more detail later in            this unit, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing            electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and            is called an anionA negatively charged ion.. Positively charged atoms called cationsA positively charged ion. are formed when an atom            loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11            electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11             10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two            electrons it will become an anion with a 2 charge (8  10 = 2).
An atom that has gained or lost electrons and therefore is electrically charged.

84,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Lattice Energy,"An ionic compound is stable because of the electrostatic attraction between its positive            and negative ions. The lattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this            attraction. The lattice energy (\xceHlattice)energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its component gaseous ions of an            ionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into            its component gaseous ions. For the ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy            change of the process:
energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its component gaseous ions
Note that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so            our lattice energies will be endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the            equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the energy released when            separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus,            if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which            definition is being used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates            a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, \xceHlattice = 769 kJ. Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of            solid NaCl into gaseous Na+ and Cl ions. When one mole each of            gaseous Na+ and Cl ions form solid NaCl, 769 kJ of heat is released.
The lattice energy \xceHlattice of an ionic crystal can                    be expressed by the following equation (derived from Coulombs law, governing the forces                    between electric charges):
in which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal                    structure; Z+ and Z are the charges on the ions; and                     Ro is the                    interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions).
            The lattice energy of an ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase            and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other parameters are kept constant,            doubling the charge of both the cation and anion quadruples the lattice energy. For            example, the lattice energy of LiF (Z+ and Z = 1) is 1023 kJ/mol,            whereas that of MgO (Z+ and Z = 2) is 3900 kJ/mol (Ro is nearly the sameabout 200 pm for both            compounds).
Different interatomic distances produce different lattice energies. For example, we can            compare the lattice energy of MgF2 (2957 kJ/mol) to that of MgI2            (2327 kJ/mol) to observe the effect on lattice energy of the smaller ionic size of            F as compared to I. The difference between lattice energies            of compounds is significantly more dependent on the charges of the ions rather than the            size of the ions because the variations between the sizes of the ions is relatively            small.
Which has the larger lattice energy, Al2O3 or                Al2Se3?
In these two ionic compounds, the charges Z+ and Z are the                same, so the difference in lattice energy will depend upon Ro. The                O2 ion is smaller than the Se2 ion. Thus,                Al2O3 would have a shorter interionic distance than                Al2Se3, and Al2O3 would have the                larger lattice energy.

85,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Limiting Reactants,"The relative amounts of reactants and products represented in a balanced chemical            equation are often referred to as stoichiometric amounts. All the exercises of the            preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, when            calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was            assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or            greater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants            are not present in stoichiometric amounts.
Consider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches:
Stoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese            slices in a 2:1 ratio. Provided with 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese, one may            prepare 11 sandwiches per the provided recipe, using all the provided cheese and having            six slices of bread left over. In this scenario, the number of sandwiches prepared has            been limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been provided in            excess.
Consider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen            with chlorine to yield hydrogen chloride:
The balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric            ratio. If these reactants are provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will            nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting the amount of product that may be            generated. This substance is the limiting reactantreactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated, and the other substance is the            excess reactantreactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation            requires computing the molar amounts of each reactant provided and comparing them to the            stoichiometric amounts represented in the balanced chemical equation. For example,            imagine combining 3 moles of H2 and 2 moles of Cl2.            This represents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction,            which is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Hydrogen, therefore, is present            in excess, and chlorine is the limiting reactant. Reaction of all the provided chlorine            (2 mol) will consume 2 mol of the 3 mol of hydrogen provided, leaving 1 mol of hydrogen            unreacted.
reactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated
reactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry
An alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the            amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant            amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per            the reactions stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the            limiting reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the            hydrogen would yield
Complete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce
The chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced.            Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl, there will be unreacted            hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting            reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant.

Silicon nitride is a very hard, high-temperature-resistant ceramic used as a                component of turbine blades in jet engines. It is prepared according to the                following equation:
Which is the limiting reactant when 2.00 g of Si and 1.50 g of N2                react?
After you have determined the limiting reactant, calculate the mass of                Si3N4 that will be produced.
Compute the provided molar amounts of reactants, and then compare these amounts to                the balanced equation to identify the limiting reactant.
The provided Si:N2 molar ratio is:
The stoichiometric Si:N2 ratio is:
Comparing these ratios shows that Si is provided in a less-than-stoichiometric                amount, and so it is the limiting reactant.
Alternatively, compute the amount of product expected for complete reaction of each                of the provided reactants.
Since silicon yields the lesser amount of product, it is the limiting reactant.
Now that we know that silicon is the limiting reactant, we can determine the mass of                the product produced. The amount of product(s) produced is always determined by the                amount of the limiting reactant.
We have previously calculated that 0.02373 mol Si3N4 is                produced by the limiting reactant. Convert mol Si3N4 to g                Si3N4.

86,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Molarity,"Concentrations of solutions may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of            measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. Molarity (M)unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution is a useful            concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number            of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution.
unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution
A 355mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the                molar concentration of sucrose in the beverage?
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the                molarity can be calculated using the definition of molarity. Per this definition,                the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:
How much sugar (mol) is contained in 10 mL of the soda described in the example                above?
In this case, we can rearrange the definition of molarity to isolate the quantity                sought, moles of sugar. We then substitute the value for molarity that we derived in                the previous example, 0.375 M.
Distilled white vinegar is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H,                in water. A 0.500L vinegar solution contains 25.2 g of acetic acid. What is the                concentration of the acetic acid solution in units of molarity?
To calculate the molarity, you need mol of solute. Convert grams of acetic acid to                mol.
Substitute the values for mol and L into the definition of molarity.
How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30M solution?
The volume and molarity of the solution are specified. We can rearrange the                definition of molarity to isolate mole.
mol solute = M  L solution
Finally, this molar amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:
When performing calculations stepwise, it is important to refrain from rounding any            intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result.            In the previous example, the molar amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol,            would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be reported; however, although the            last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the            intermediate calculation. If we had not retained this guard digit, the final calculation            for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g.
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, we can also avoid            rounding errors by performing computations in a single step. This eliminates            intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.
In many situations you will be concerned with the molarity of a solution as                    described above. However, sometimes it may be useful to consider the                    concentration of individual ions in solution. Remember the equation for                    molarity:
When ionic compounds are dissolved in water they dissociate into their                    constituent ions. When sodium chloride, NaCl, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Na+ and one Cl ion per formula unit dissolved.                    However, when calcium chloride, CaCl2, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Ca2+ and two Cl ions per formula unit                    dissolved. This means that the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of Ca2+ ions when CaCl2 is                    dissolved in water. Likewise the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of the solution.
Animations developed from PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado                    Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu.
The solution of CaCl2 in the right animation has twice the                    concentration of Cl to Ca2+.
What is the concentration in molarity of a CaCl2 solution in which 4.85 g                of CaCl2 has been dissolved in water to form 850 mL of solution? What is                the concentration in molarity of the Ca2+ ions in the solution                and the Cl ions in the solution?
Calculating the molarity of the CaCl2 solution is the same process as we                have seen previously.
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
Since there is one Ca2+ ion produced per formula unit of                    CaCl2, the concentration of Ca2+ is also 0.0514                M.
Since there are two Cl ions produced per formula unit of                CaCl2, the concentration of Cl is:
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Ca2+ is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Cl is 0.103 M.

87,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Mole Conversions: Single Step,"The relationships between formula mass, the mole, and Avogadros number can be                    applied to compute various quantities that describe the composition of                    substances and compounds. For example, if we know the mass and chemical                    composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate                    number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of                    moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and                    calculate the substances mass.
According to nutritional guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture,                        the estimated average requirement for dietary potassium is 4.7 g. What is                        the estimated average requirement of potassium in moles?
The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is                        requested. Referring to the periodic table, the atomic mass of K is 39.10                        amu, and so its molar mass is 39.10 g/mol.
We can use this relationship between mol of K and g of K as a conversion                        factor and solve using dimensional analysis.
We can see when we set up the dimensional analysis that we will divide by the                        molar mass for the answer.
Vitamin C is a covalent compound with the molecular formula                            C6H8O6. The recommended daily dietary                        allowance of vitamin C for children aged 4 years is 1.42                        mol. What is the mass of this allowance in grams?

We can use this relationship between mol of                            C6H8O6 and g of                            C6H8O6 as a conversion factor and solve                        using dimensional analysis.

88,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Quantum Numbers,"The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons inatoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theoryprovides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor tochemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energylevels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in anatom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values andcan jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or staybetween these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n =, 2, 3, . Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greaterfor greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum numberquantum number specifying the shell an electron occupies in an atom. The principlequantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially thesame concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for theprincipal quantum number is the shell number. The shellsset of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n of an atom can bethought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons thatbelong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the correspondingcircular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shellnumber, and so the higher the energy level. The positively charged protons inthe nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attractionbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of theelectrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater theenergy it has.

set of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n
The principal quantum number, n, is one of three quantumnumbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbitalmathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables, which is distinctfrom an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is mostprobable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability offinding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and isbased on solutions of the Schrdinger equation. In addition, the principlequantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-likeatom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general regionin which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ionsare located. The values for n can be positive wholenumbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...

Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantumquantum number distinguishing the different shapes of orbitals; it is also a measure of the orbital angular momentumnumber. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on thevalues, l = 0, 1, 2, , n  1.This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only onevalue of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number definesthe general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape ofthe orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshellset of orbitals in an atom with the same values of n and l. In addition, thegreater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentumof an electron at this orbital.

Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitalsspherical region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 0. An electron in this orbital is called an s electron (or the ssubshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitalsdumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a p electron. The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitalsregion of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2. An electron in this orbital is called a d electron, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitalsmultilobed region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 3. An electron in this orbital is called an f electron for l =, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider.

The subshell which exist within the shells exhibit different shapes of electron densitya measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function . The value of the Magnetic Quantum Number, ml, indicates the region that an electron occupieswithin a subshell based on the shape of the subshell.
a measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function 
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical, as seen in the diagrambelow.
For the s subshell there is only one region, the sphere, in which an electroncan reside. Therefore in the s subshell there is only one value for ml, which is designated 0. Each region ofelectron density of a subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. Since the ssubshell only has one region of electron density the maximum number of electronsfor any s subshell is 2.
The shape of the p sublevel is more complex than the s sublevel, consisting of 3dumbbell-shaped orbitals originating from a center origin and along the x, y, and z axis as seen in the diagram below.
Within a p subshell electrons may reside in one of the three dumbbell-shapedregions. Therefore, within the p subshell there are three possible values forml, which are -1, 0, 1. Because there are three regions ofelectron density in a p subshell, a maximum of 6 electrons can occupy any psubshell.
The shape of the d subshell is even more complex as seen in the diagram below.Describing the exact shape of the regions of electron density is not importantfor our purposes, but you do need to recognize there are a total of five regionsof electron density within this subshell. Therefore for the d subshell, thereare five possible values for ml which are designated -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.The five regions of electron density, indicate that any d subshell can hold 10electrons.
As you might expect, the shapes of the regions of electron density are even morecomplex within the f subshell. Again, knowing the specific of the shapes is notimportant for our purposes, however you should recognize that there are sevenregions of electron density. Therefore there are seven possible values forml within the f subshell, which are designated -3, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A maximum of 14 electrons can occupy the seven regions ofelectron density in a f subshell.

89,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure,"The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and            the molecular structures:
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for CO2.
We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:
This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atomeach double                bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using                VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves                on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180. The electron-pair                geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are                linear.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for BCl3.
We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:
Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of                electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives                a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The BCl bonds lie in a plane with 120                angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular structure.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a water molecule.
The Lewis structure of H2O indicates that there are four regions of high                electron density around the oxygen atom: two lone pairs and two chemical bonds:
We predict that these four regions are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion. Thus, the                electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular structure is bent with an                angle slightly less than 109.5. In fact, the bond angle is 104.5.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of SF4.
The Lewis structure of SF4 indicates five regions of electron density                around the sulfur atom: one lone pair and four bonding pairs:
We predict that these five regions of electron density are arranged to give a                trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry. The one lone-pair on the sulfur will                occupy a position in the equitorial plane, giving a seesaw molecular geometry.
When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular                    structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do                    not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms                    that each possess a clocald geometry. The way these local structures are                    oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but                    such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory                    discussion. For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local                    structures.
The Lewis structure for the simplest amino acid, glycine,                            H2NCH2CO2H, is shown here. Predict the                        local geometry for the nitrogen atom, the two carbon atoms, and the oxygen                        atom with a hydrogen atom attached:
Consider each central atom independently.
The electron-pair geometries:
The local structures:
We can use the wedge and dash notation when drawing the Lewis structure to                        better represent the local shapes within the molecule.

90,Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter,Physical and Chemical Properties,"The characteristics that enable us to distinguish one substance from another                     are called properties. A physical propertyA characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. is a characteristic of matter that                     is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples                     of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling                     points, and electrical conductivity. We can observe some physical properties,                     such as density and color, without changing the physical state of the matter                     observed. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron                     or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes                     a physical change. A physical changeA change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition. is a change in the state or properties                     of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition (the                     identities of the substances contained in the matter). We observe a physical                     change when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses                     into liquid water. Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and                     demagnetizing metals (as is done with common anti-theft security tags) and                     grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes                     in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state,                     form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.
A characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition.
A change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition.
                    The change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change) is                     a chemical propertyThe change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change).. Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity,                    acidity, reactivity (many types), and heat of combustion. Iron, for example, combines                     with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize.                     Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no                     hazard because it is very unreactive.

To identify a chemical property, we look for a chemical change. A chemical changeA change in matter that always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change. always                     produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change.                     The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than                     the iron, oxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin                     is a chemical change because the gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the                     original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions that are performed                     in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and                     food being cooked, digested, or rotting.

91,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Pressure and Temperature,"During the seventeenth and especiallyeighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a questto make balloons in which they could fly, a number of scientists established therelationships between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is,pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although their measurementswere not precise by todays standards, they were able to determine themathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure andtemperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gasa hypotheticalconstruct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually,these individual laws were combined into a single equationthe ideal gaslawthat relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for lowpressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments inindividual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historicalorder), then put them together in the ideal gas law.
Imagine filling a rigid container attachedto a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas mayescape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and itspressure is observed to decrease. Since the container is rigid and tightlysealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we heatthe sphere, the gas inside gets hotter and the pressure increases.
This relationship between temperature andpressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume. Anexample of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of airunder these conditions in the figure below. We find that temperature and pressure arelinearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then P and Tare directly proportional (again, when volume and moles of gas are heldconstant); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor,the gas pressure increases by the same factor.

Guillaume Amontons was the first toempirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperatureof a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship moreprecisely (~1800). The P-T relationship for gases is more commonly known asGay-Lussac's lawpressure of a given number of moles of gas is directly proportional to its kelvin temperature when the volume is held constant.
pressure of a given number of moles of gas is directly proportional to its kelvin temperature when the volume is held constant
Under either name, it states that thepressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature onthe kelvin scale when the volume is held constant. Mathematically, this can bewritten:
The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to itstemperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant.Mathematically, this can be written:
The gas in a sealed can is initially at C and 360 kPa, and the can has a volume of 350 mL. If the can is left ina car that reaches 50 C on a hot day, assuming no change in the volume ofthe can, what is the new pressure in the can?
First let's think about theproblem. Will the pressure increase or decrease? Because the temperature isincreasing the pressure will increase as well.
We are looking for a pressure changedue to a temperature change at constant volume, so we will use Gay-Lussacslaw.
Identify the variables from theproblem.
P = 360 kPa
T = 24 C
P = ?
T = 50 C
Next we need to convert the temperaturevalues to kelvin.
P = 360 kPa
T = 24 C  297 K
P = ?
T = 50 C  323 K
Now we can plug the values into theequation and solve for P .
Rearranging the variables to solve forP gives:
This value matches our originalassumption that an increase in the temperature will result in an increase inthe pressure.

92,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Quantized Energy and the Photoelectric Effect,"One observation that could not be adequately explained by viewing light as waves                    is the light emitted as objects are heated. The wavelengths and intensities of the                     objects energy distribution can be measured by a spectrometer, and each distribution                     depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. As shown in the figure below,                     the maxima in these spectral distribution curves, \xce\xbbmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as                     the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that as a metal is heated it glows                     red, then orange, yellow, and eventually white (as the intensities of all of the visible                     wavelengths become appreciable at very high temperatures). This common observation was                          at the heart of the first paradox showing the fundamental limitations of classical physics                     that we will examine.
Using the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism, which held that electromagnetic waves                     could have any frequency within a continuously varying range, late 19th century scientists derived                     mathematical expressions for these energy distributions. These expressions fit the observed experimental                     blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths but diverged more and more as the wavelength became shorter,                    with the absurd consequence of infinitely large energies as the wavelength approached zero. This became                     known as the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"", since it implied that everyday objects at room temperature should                     be emitting large amounts of UV light and no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment                     that led to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.
Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for this phenomenon that                    fit the experimental observations. Planck treated the vibrating atoms as the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation                    (a premise from previous work), but instead of allowing the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a                    continuous set of energies (as allowed by classical physics, and as previously thought) Planck proposed that the vibrational                     energies were restricted to a discrete set of values for each frequency (i.e. that energy was quantized).
E\\;=\\;nh\u\\;,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;n\\;=\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;...
The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck\'s constant, in his honor.                    Although it appears that energy is emitted and absorbed continuously and not in                    discrete quantities, notice that the value of Planck\'s constant is very small,                    6.626 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy                    quantization is not observed in macroscopic phenomena.
The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the                    photoelectric effect. It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from                    the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than a                    threshold frequency, unique to the type of metal, was shone on it. Since the electrons in the metal had a                    certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed                    to have more energy - and therefore a higher frequency - to free the electrons. This is illustrated in the animation                    below.
According to classical wave theory, a wave\'s energy depends on its intensity                     (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. However, the frequency at which                     electrons start to be emitted from the metal (known as the threshold frequency)                     does not change when the intensity of the light changes. This is illustrated by comparing                     the animation below with the animation above.
Although the threshold frequency doesn\'t change with changes in intensity (brightness) of the light,                     once the threshold is met the number of electrons emitted within a given time period (i.e. the electric                     current) increases with increasing intensity of the light. This is shown in the following two animations.
Along with the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons also does not depend                     on the intensity of the light. However, if the frequency of the light is increased the kinetic energy of                     the electrons increases as well. This is shown in the graph below.
Different metals have different threshold frequencies. As we have seen in the                    previous animations the wavelength of the frequency threshold for sodium is                    approximately 500 nm. As seen in the animation below the wavelength of the                    threshold frequency for calcium is approximately 400 nm.
In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck\'s quantization                     findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work,                     and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).                     Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated could be                    applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the                    metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of                    particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency,                    according to Planck\'s formula, E = h\xce\xbd (or, in terms of wavelength using c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd,                    E = hc/\xce\xbb).
Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency                    greater than the threshold). Einstein also argued that the light intensity did                    not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to                    the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This                    explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing                    brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the                    likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.
With Einstein\'s findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Some                    phenomena could be explained by viewing light as a wave and other phenomena,                    such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by viewing light as a                    particle. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light                    is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality.
When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon                atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the                photon being emitted?
We use the part of Planck\'s equation that includes the wavelength, h\xce\xbd\xce\xbb, and convert                units of nanometers to meters so that the units of \xce\xbb correspond to the length units of c.

93,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Significant Figures,"Counting is a type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number             of objects being counted does not change while the counting process is underway.             The result of such a counting measurement is an example of an exact number. If we             count eggs in a carton, we know exactly how many eggs the carton contains. The             numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12             inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram.             Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain             to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.
The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities,                 are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should                 make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface                 of the liquid.
Refer to the illustration in Figure above. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly                 lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21                 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the                 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquids volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number                 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate                 the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place                 digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit                 to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place,                 given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on                 this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division.                 The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL.
This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you                 place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits                 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71                 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement                 of  0.01 gram. If we weigh the quarter on a more sensitive balance, we may find that its mass is                 6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram.                 Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the users ability).                 All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant                     figures(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you                 stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows ,d then the 1 (hundreds),                 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.
(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit
All digits that are part of a measurement are significant digits. However, in some measurements                 we must include zeros as place holders, it is these zeros that are not significant digits.                 Let\'s look at an example.
Say that you wanted to record the volume of liquid in the flask pictured above. You can say with                 certainty that the volume is between 200 and 300 ml and you can make an estimate that the volume                 is closer to 200 than to 300. Your estimated digit would be in the tens place. Let\'s say you                 estimate that a 2 should be in the tens place. The 2 in the hundreds place is a certain digit                 and the 2 in the tens place is your estimated digit. However, you cannot record the volume as                 22 ml. You would add a zero in the ones place to show the place values of the twos and record                 the volume as 220 ml. In this example the 0 is not part of the measurement, as it is neither                 a certain nor estimated digit, it is a placeholder and therefore not a significant digit.
Here we will look at some guidelines to follow in determining whether or not digits in a measurement                 are significant. All nonzero digits are always significant. The zeros are a little more complex. We                 will use the terms cleading,d ctrailing,d and ccaptived for the zeros and will consider how to deal                 with them.
Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This                 is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the                 left of where the decimal point would be located.
Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never                 significantthey merely tell us where the decimal point is located.
The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation and express the                 number as 8.32407×10-3; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures,                 and 10-3 locates the decimal point.
The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal                 point location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate                 where the decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation:                 1.3×103 (two significant figures), 1.30×103 (three significant figures, if the                 tens place was measured), or 1.300×103 (four significant figures, if the ones place was                 also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is available, it is prudent to assume                 that all trailing zeros are not significant.

94,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Simple Cubic Unit Cells,"Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids            are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of their particles because            the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total            intermolecular energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient            manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level is often reflected at a macroscopic            level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of            metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined            experimentally.
We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids             by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple because each contains only             one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely             together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as             their malleability and ductility, are largely due to having identical atoms arranged in             a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to another partially             depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We             will explore the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal             geometries in the sections that follow.
The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a            metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is            referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent            the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell            repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in the figure below.
A unit cell shows the locations of                lattice points repeating in all directions.
Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice            structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit            cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as            tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this            would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in            the layer below, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called simple            cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive            cubic unit cell.
When metal atoms are arranged with                spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the                lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in                contact.
In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not            packed as closely as they could be, and they only cfilld about 52% of the volume of the            container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium,            Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in the figure below a solid with            this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only            the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above;            and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that            each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a            polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.
An atom in a simple cubic lattice                structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of                six.
In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that            repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms, as shown            below. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge            length of this cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit            cell contains only the parts of these atoms that are within it. Since an atom at a            corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only            one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit            cell has one atom at each of its eight ccorners,d there is \\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom            within one simple cubic unit cell.
A simple cubic lattice unit cell                contains one-eighth of an atom at each of its eight corners, so it contains one                atom total.
The edge length of the unit cell of alpha                polonium is 336 pm.
(a) Determine the radius of a polonium atom.
(b) Determine the density of alpha polonium.
Alpha polonium crystallizes in a simple cubic                unit cell:
(a) Two adjacent Po atoms contact each other,                so the edge length of this cell is equal to two Po atomic radii: l = 2r. Therefore,                the radius of Po is:
r\\;=\\;\\frac                l2=\\frac{336\\;\\mathrm{pm}}2=168\\;\\mathrm{pm}
(b) Density is given by \\(                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) The density of polonium can be found by                determining the density of its unit cell (the mass contained within a unit cell                divided by the volume of the unit cell). Since a Po unit cell contains one-eighth of                a Po atom at each of its eight corners, a unit cell contains one Po atom.
The mass of a Po unit cell can be found by:

95,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Vapor Pressure,"We witness and utilize changes of physical state, or phase transitions, in a great number            of ways. As one example of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation,            freezing, and melting of water. These changes of state are essential aspects of our            earths water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and technological processes            of central importance to our lives.
When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas            phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of            the condensed phase, and in some cases, these collisions will result in the molecules            re-entering the condensed phase. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate            of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the            container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the            liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually            exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a dynamic            equilibrium, the status of a system in which reciprocal processes (for example,            vaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by the vapor            in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the            liquids vapor pressure (or equilibrium vapor pressure). We can measure the vapor            pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated            below, and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the            vapor in equilibrium with the condensed phase.
The chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths)            of intermolecular attractions possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit            different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong intermolecular attractive            forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring crecaptured of gas-phase            molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor            pressure. Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and            a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The            following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular            attractive forces.
Given the shown structural formulas for these four compounds, explain their relative                vapor pressures in terms of types and extents of IMFs:
As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to                    the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature,                    the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic energies, with a                    certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and                    escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of                    molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid. The escape of more                    molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that                    escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.
When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric                    pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid is                    the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure                    exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open                    containers, this pressure is that due to the earths atmosphere. The normal                    boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding                    pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). Figure shows the variation in vapor                    pressure with temperature for several different substances. Considering the                    definition of boiling point, these curves may be seen as depicting the                    dependence of a liquids boiling point on surrounding pressure.

96,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Vapor Pressure Lowering,"As described in the unit on liquids and solids, the equilibrium vapor pressure of a            liquid is the pressure exerted by its gaseous phase when vaporization and condensation            are occurring at equal rates:
Dissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in a lowering of the            liquids vapor pressure. This phenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect            of added solute molecules on the liquid\'s vaporization and condensation processes. To            vaporize, solvent molecules must be present at the surface of the solution. The presence            of solute decreases the surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces            the rate of solvent vaporization. Since the rate of condensation is unaffected by the            presence of solute, the net result is that the vaporization-condensation equilibrium is            achieved with fewer solvent molecules in the vapor phase (i.e., at a lower vapor            pressure).
The relationship between the vapor pressures of solution components and the            concentrations of those components is described by Raoults law.
The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to                    the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the                    solution.
where PA is the partial pressure exerted by                    component A in the solution, PoA                    is the vapor pressure of pure A, and XA is                    the mole fraction of A in the solution.
In solutions containing nonvolatile solutes (which will always be the case for                    our purposes)
Compute the vapor pressure of an ideal solution containing 92.1 g of glycerin,                C3H5(OH)3, and 184.4 g of ethanol,                C2H5OH, at 40 C. The vapor pressure of pure ethanol is                0.178 atm at 40 C. Glycerin is essentially nonvolatile at this temperature.
Since the solvent is the only volatile component of this solution, its vapor pressure                may be computed per Raoults law as:
First, calculate the molar amounts of each solution component using the provided mass                data.
Next, calculate the mole fraction of the solvent (ethanol) and use Raoults law to                compute the solutions vapor pressure.

98,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,BCC and FCC Unit Cells,"Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of            unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells: simple cubic (which we have            already seen), body-centered cubic unit cell, and face-centered cubic unit cellall of which are            illustrated in the figure below. (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems,            some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit            cells. We leave the more complicated geometries for later in this module.)
Cubic unit cells of metals show (in the upper                figures) the locations of lattice points and (in the lower figures) metal atoms located in the                unit cell.
Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a            cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the center, as shown in the            figure below. This is called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corners of a BCC            unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains            two atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom from            the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom in this structure touches four atoms in the            layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC structure has a            coordination number of eight.
In a body-centered cubic structure, atoms in a                specific layer do not touch each other. Each atom touches four atoms in the layer above it and                four atoms in the layer below it.
Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently            packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68% of the total volume. Isomorphous            metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature. (Elements or            compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous.)
Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead,            crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and at            the centers of each face, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called a            face-centered cubic (FCC) solid. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at            each of the eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom            on each of the six faces (\\(6\imes\\\;=3\\) atoms from the faces). The atoms at the corners            touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of the cube.            Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.
A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the                corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the faces of its unit cells.
Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely            together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume. This structure is also called cubic            closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms.            Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer            below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination            number of 12. The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately            obvious, but why they are actually the same structure is illustrated below.
A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating                layers (ABCABC) of hexagonally arranged atoms. Atoms in a CCP structure have a coordination                number of 12 because they contact six atoms in their layer, plus three atoms in the layer above                and three atoms in the layer below. By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP                structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from                layer B across a diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from                layer C at the remaining corner. This is the same as a face-centered cubic                arrangement.
Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions            between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in            this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP,            which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in the following            figure. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second            layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact            with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP,            atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is            also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers            (i.e., ABABABb\xaf). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two            layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type            B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABCb\xaf). About twothirds of all metals crystallize            in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of 12. Metals that crystallize in an HCP            structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a CCP structure            include Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt.
In both types of closest packing, atoms are                packed as compactly as possible. Hexagonal closest packing consists of two alternating layers                (ABABAB). Cubic closest packing consists of three alternating layers                (ABCABCABC).
Calcium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure.                The edge length of its unit cell is 558.8 pm.
(a) What is the atomic radius of Ca in this structure?
(b) Calculate the density of Ca.
(a) In an FCC structure, Ca atoms contact each other                across the diagonal of the face, so the length of the diagonal is equal to four Ca atomic radii                (d = 4r).
Two adjacent edges and the diagonal of the face form a                right triangle, with the length of each side equal to 558.8 pm and the length of the hypotenuse                equal to four Ca atomic radii:
\\mathrm a^2+\\mathrm a^2=\\mathrm                d^2\\longrightarrow{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2+{(558.5\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2=(4\\mathrm r)^2\\;

(b) Density is given by \\(                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) . The density of calcium can be found by determining the                density of its unit cell: for example, the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the                volume of the unit cell. A face-centered Ca unit cell has one-eighth of an atom at each of the                eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces                \\(6\imes\\\;=3\\) atoms), for a total of four atoms in the unit cell.

(Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm                to get the usual volume units for density.)
Then, the density of Ca is:

In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of            three axes (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between them, as illustrated below. The            axes are defined as being the lengths between points in the space lattice. Consequently, unit            cell axes join points with identical environments.
A cube is shown where each corner has a black dot drawn            on it. A circle in the bottom of the cube is composed of three double-ended arrows. The left top            of this circle is labeled calpha,d the top right is labeled cbetad and the bottom is labeled            cgamma.d The bottom left corner of the cube is labeled cad while the bottom of the back face is            labeled cbd and the top, back, left corner is labeled cc.d
A unit cell is defined by the lengths of its three axes            (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between the axes. There are seven different lattice            systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of fourteen different unit            cells, which have the shapes shown below.

99,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Boiling Point Elevation and Freezing Point Depression,"As described previously, the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its            vapor pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a            solution is lowered due to the presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that            the solutions boiling point will subsequently be increased. Compared to pure solvent, a            solution, therefore, will require a higher temperature to achieve any given vapor            pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere. The increase            in boiling point observed when nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, \xceTb, is called boiling point elevation.
Boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the molal concentration of                    solute species:
where Kb is the boiling point elevation                    constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute species.
Boiling point elevation constants are characteristic properties that depend on the            identity of the solvent. Values of Kb for several            solvents are listed in the table below.
Solutions freeze at lower temperatures than pure liquids. This phenomenon is exploited in            cde-icingd schemes that use salt, calcium chloride, or urea to melt ice on roads and            sidewalks, and in the use of ethylene glycol as an cantifreezed in automobile radiators.            Seawater freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water, and so the Arctic and            Antarctic oceans remain unfrozen even at temperatures below 0 C (as do the body fluids            of fish and other cold-blooded sea animals that live in these oceans).
The decrease in freezing point of a dilute solution compared to that of the pure solvent,                \xceTf, is called the freezing point depression.
Freezing point depression is directly proportional to the molal concentration of                    solute species:
where Kf is the freezing point depression                    constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute                    species.
Just as for boiling point elevation constants, these are characteristic properties whose            values depend on the chemical identity of the solvent. Values of Kf for several solvents are listed below.
The extent to which boiling point is increased and freezing point decrease for a solvent            depends on the total number of solute particles present in a given amount of solvent,            not on the mass or size or chemical identities of the particles. A 1 m aqueous solution            of sucrose (342 g/mol) and a 1 m aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (62 g/mol) will            exhibit the same boiling point because each solution has one mole of solute particles            (molecules) per kilogram of solvent.
What is the boiling point of a 0.33 m solution of a                nonvolatile solute in benzene?
First, calculate the change in boiling point.
Since we know that boiling point increases with the addition of a solute, add the                boiling point elevation to the pure solvents boiling point.
Find the boiling point and freezing point of a solution of 92.1 g of iodine,                    I2, in 800.0 g of chloroform, CHCl3, assuming that the                iodine is nonvolatile and that the solution is ideal. The boiling point of pure                chloroform is 61.2 oC.
First we will need to convert mass of I2 to moles in order to determine                the molality of the solution.
Calculate the molality of the solution.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in boiling point and molal                concentration to determine how much the boiling point changes.
Determine the new boiling point from the boiling point of the pure solvent and the                change.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.
Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the                change.
The colligative effects on vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point                    described in the previous section are conveniently summarized by comparing the                    phase diagrams for a pure liquid and a solution derived from that liquid. Phase                    diagrams for water and an aqueous solution are shown in the diagram below.
The liquid-vapor curve for the solution is located beneath the corresponding                    curve for the solvent, depicting the vapor pressure lowering, \xceP, that results                    from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute. Consequently, at any given pressure,                    the solutions boiling point is observed at a higher temperature than that for                    the pure solvent, reflecting the boiling point elevation, \xceTb, associated with                    the presence of nonvolatile solute. The solid-liquid curve for the solution is                    displaced left of that for the pure solvent, representing the freezing point                    depression, \xceTf, that accompanies solution formation. Finally, notice that the                    solid-gas curves for the solvent and its solution are identical. This is the                    case for many solutions comprising liquid solvents and nonvolatile solutes. Just                    as for vaporization, when a solution of this sort is frozen, it is actually just                    the solvent molecules that undergo the liquid-to-solid transition, forming pure                    solid solvent that excludes solute species. The solid and gaseous phases,                    therefore, are composed of solvent only, and so transitions between these phases                    are not subject to colligative effects.

100,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Physical Processes,"One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical            process is known as calorimetryprocess of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat            transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated            object (calorimeterdevice used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter            is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to            establish the calorimeters heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach            requires the definition of a systemportion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical            or physical change) and its surroundingsall matter other than the system being studied (the other components of the measurement            apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the            system). Knowledge of the heat capacity of the surroundings, and careful measurements of            the masses of the system and surroundings and their temperatures before and after the            process allows one to calculate the heat transferred as described in this section.

A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or            physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a            calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which            increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is            absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature. The            temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be            used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.
Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat            between the calorimeter and its environment. This enables the accurate determination of            the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General            chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups.            These easy-to-use ccoffee cupd calorimeters allow more heat exchange with their            surroundings, and therefore produce less accurate energy values, but for the purposes of            a general chemistry student are accurate enough.
Before we practice calorimetry problems involving chemical reactions, consider a simpler            example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry.
Click through the slide show below that describes the general concepts of calorimetry.
If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two            substances (in this example the water and the metal), with no heat gained or lost by            either the calorimeter or the calorimeters surroundings. Under these ideal            circumstances, the net heat change is zero:
This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by the metal is equal to            the heat lost the water:
The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the            negative sign merely shows that qmetal and qwater are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain            or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic sign of either q            value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per            definition). In the specific situation described, qmetal is a negative value and qwater is positive, since heat is transferred from the metal to the            water.
A 248 g piece of copper is dropped into 392 mL of water at 22.6 C in a coffee cup                calorimeter. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 C. Calculate                the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs                between the copper and the water. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g C.
The temperature of the water increases from 22.6 C to 39.9 C, so the water absorbs                heat. That heat came from the piece of copper, which initially was at a higher                temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the copper and the water,                with no heat clostd to the surroundings, then heat given off by the copper = heat                taken in by water, or:
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:
Letting f = final and i = initial, in                expanded form, this becomes:
The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 392 mL of water = 392 g. Noting that the final                temperature of both the copper and water is 39.9 C, substituting known values                yields:
Rearranging to solve for Ti,copper:
Solving this gives Ti,copper = 337 C, so the initial temperature of the                copper was 337 C.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of            an unknown metal.
A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly                transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 C in a calorimeter. The final                temperature is 28.5 C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal.                Use this result to identify the metal.
Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,                or:
                qmetal = qwater
In expanded form, this is:
Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was            100.0 C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:
Rearranging the equation to solve for cmetal:
Comparing this with values in the table on page ""Heat Capacity and Specific Heat"" , our            experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g C), so we identify the metal as copper.","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to see the example progress.",what is calorimetry?,41.984596252441406

102,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Covalent Bond Formation,"In ionic compounds, electrons are transferred between atoms of different elements to form            ions. But this is not the only way that compounds can be formed. Atoms can also make            chemical bonds by sharing electrons  between each other. Such bonds are called            covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar            tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or            fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen            atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the            H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same            number of valence electrons as the noble gas He
Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic            compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is            weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have            much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent            compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are            typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good            conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble            in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity            in any state.
Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the            hydrogen molecule, H2, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen            atoms. The diagram illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we            have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the            red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms            approach each other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to            overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic            nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared            electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the            bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive            charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases.            The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is            achieved.
Similar to hydrogen, an oxygen atom will form a covalent bond with another oxygen                atom to form and oxygen molecule, O2. In this interactive you will                explore the energy associated with the formation of this bond.

1. Click on the radio button for two oxygen atoms.
2. Zoom out on the graph so that the full potential energy graph can be viewed. The                graph should look like the image below.
3. Drag the oxygen atom on the right to the right so that it lines up with the right                side of the graph.
4. When you let go of the oxygen atom you see that it very slowly begins to move                towards the stationary oxygen atom. Continue watching as the two oxygen atoms get                closer together.
5. Now drag the oxygen atom on the right that has formed the covalent bond with the                oxygen atom of the left further to the left. Observe the graph.
It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an            endothermic process), whereas forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic            process). In the case of H2, the covalent bond is very strong; a large amount            of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules            and cause the atoms to separate:
Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2            molecules forms from two moles of H atoms:
Repeat steps 1-4 above. Click on the oxygen atom. Drag the atom on the right to the                right and observe as the two atoms are drawn together to form a covalent bond and an                oxygen molecule.

103,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Dilution of Solution,"Dilutionprocess of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes is the process whereby the concentration of a solution is lessened by the            addition of solvent. For example, we might say that a glass of iced tea becomes            increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the            volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby            reducing the relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its            taste.
process of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes
Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By            adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can            achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically            sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is            appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must            be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of            common laboratory reagents.
A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations            of a solution before and after the dilution process. According to the definition of            molarity, the molar amount of solute in a solution is equal to the product of the            solutions molarity and its volume in liters:
Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:
where the subscripts d and d refer to the solution before and after the dilution,            respectively. Since the dilution process does not change the amount of solute in the            solution, n1 = n2. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to            one another.
Although we derived this equation using molarity as the unit of concentration and                    liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be                    used, so long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method.                    Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more                    general form:
where C and V are concentration                    and volume, respectively.
If 0.850 L of a 5.00M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is                diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the                diluted solution?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and                    C1, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, V2.                We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, C2. We thus                rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate C2:
Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased                from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), we would expect the diluted solutions concentration to be                less than one-half 5 M. We will compare this ballpark estimate to the calculated                result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, an improper                substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms                on the right side of this equation yields:
This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (its a bit less than one-half the                stock concentration, 5 M).
What volume of 0.12 M HBr can be prepared from 11 mL (0.011 L) of 0.45 M HBr?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and                    C1, and the concentration of the resultant diluted solution,                    C2. We need to find the volume of the diluted solution,                V2. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate                    V2:
Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the                original concentration (0.45 M), we would expect the volume of the diluted solution                to be roughly four times the original volume, or around 44 mL. Substituting the                given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
The volume of the 0.12 M solution is 0.041 L (41 mL). The result is reasonable and                compares well with our rough estimate.
What volume of 1.59 M KOH is required to prepare 5.00 L of 0.100 M KOH?
We are given the concentration of a stock solution, C1, and the volume and                concentration of the resultant diluted solution, V2 and C2. We                need to find the volume of the stock solution, V1. We thus rearrange the                dilution equation in order to isolate V1:
Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that                of the stock solution (1.59 M), we would expect the volume of the stock solution to                be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters.                Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
Thus, we would need 0.314 L of the 1.59 M solution to prepare the desired solution.                This result is consistent with our rough estimate.

104,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment,"As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing            electronegativities, leaving one atom with a partial positive charge (\xce+) and the other            atom with a partial negative charge (\xce), as the electrons are pulled toward the more            electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole momentseparation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector. The            magnitude of a bond dipole momentproperty of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure is represented by the Greek letter mu () and is given            by the formula shown here, where Q is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined            by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between the charges:
separation of charge in a bond that depends on the difference in electronegativity and the bond distance represented by partial charges or a vector
property of a molecule that describes the separation of charge determined by the sum of the individual bond moments based on the molecular structure
This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and            magnitude. Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less            electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on            the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end of the bond. The            length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference            between the two atoms.
A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular            structure and the polarity of each of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the            molecule is said to be a polar molecule(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment (or dipole); otherwise the molecule is said to            be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the            molecule as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in            three-dimensional space, taking into account the molecular structure.
(also, dipole) molecule with an overall dipole moment
For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the            molecular polarity. Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and                N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment is            zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF,            there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in            electronegativity.
When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If            the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum            equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in CO2.            Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis            structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is            linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments            cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water            molecule, the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom,            and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero            bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone            pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net            dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).
The OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO2, but a sulfur atom has            replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the            molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:
The C-O bond is considerably polar. Although C and S have very similar electronegativity            values, S is slightly more electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly            polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, the oxygen end of the            molecule is the negative end. The OCS molecule is polar.
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, is another example of a polar molecule. Although the            polar CCl and CH bonds are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry, the CCl bonds have a            larger bond moment than the CH bond, and the bond moments do not completely cancel each            other. All of the dipoles have a downward component in the orientation shown, since            carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen and less electronegative than chlorine. The                CH3Cl molecule is polar.
When we examine the highly symmetrical molecules BF3 (trigonal planar), CH4            (tetrahedral), PF5 (trigonal bipyramidal), and SF6 (octahedral), in which all            the polar bonds are identical, the molecules are nonpolar. The bonds in these molecules            are arranged such that their dipoles cancel. However, just because a molecule contains            identical bonds does not mean that the dipoles will always cancel. Many molecules that            have identical bonds and lone pairs on the central atoms have bond dipoles that do not            cancel because their molecular shape is not symmetrical. Examples include H2S and NH3. A            hydrogen atom is at the positive end and a nitrogen or sulfur atom is at the negative            end of the polar bonds in these molecules:
To summarize, to be polar, a molecule must:
Polar molecules tend to align when placed in an electric field with the positive                    end of the molecule oriented toward the negative plate and the negative end                    toward the positive plate. We can use an electrically charged object to attract                    polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents                    are better at dissolving polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at                    dissolving nonpolar substances.

This attractive force is also called the London dispersion force in honor of            German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. Because the electrons of an atom or            molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electrons location is subject            to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can            develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed            asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a            neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly            fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction            between the speciesa dispersion force like that illustrated below.
Dispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two            molecules to each other. The forces are relatively weak, however, can become significant            only when the molecules are very close. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules exhibit            stronger dispersion forces than do smaller and lighter atoms and molecules.                F2 and Cl2 are gases at room temperature (reflecting weaker            attractive forces); Br2 is a liquid, and I2 is a solid (reflecting            stronger attractive forces). Trends in observed melting and boiling points for the            halogens clearly demonstrate this effect, as seen in the table below.
The increase in melting and boiling points with increasing atomic/molecular size may be            rationalized by considering how the strength of dispersion forces is affected by the            electronic structure of the atoms or molecules in the substance. In a larger atom, the            valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei than in a smaller atom. Thus,            they are less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that produce            the attraction. The measure of how easy or difficult it is for another electrostatic            charge (for example, a nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecules charge            distribution (its electron cloud) is known as polarizability. A molecule that has a            charge cloud that is easily distorted is said to be very polarizable and will have large            dispersion forces; one with a large cloud that is difficult to distort is not very            polarizable and will have small dispersion forces.
Order the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to                highest boiling point: CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and                    SnH4. Explain your reasoning.
All of these compounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may                experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the molecule, the less polarizable                and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the                dispersion forces. The molar masses of CH4, SiH4,                    GeH4, and SnH4 are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol, 77 g/mol, and                123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH4 is expected to have the lowest                boiling point and SnH4 the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to                highest boiling point is expected to be CH4 < SiH4 <                    GeH4 < SnH4.
A graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the                group 14 element shows this prediction to be correct:
The shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces                    between them. For example, boiling points for the isomers n-pentane, isopentane,                    and neopentane (shown below) are 36 C, 27 C, and 9.5 C, respectively. Even                    though these compounds are composed of molecules with the same chemical formula,                        C5H12, the difference in boiling points suggests that                    dispersion forces in the liquid phase are different, being greatest for                    n-pentane and least for neopentane. The elongated shape of n-pentane provides a                    greater surface area available for contact between molecules, resulting in                    correspondingly stronger dispersion forces. The more compact shape of isopentane                    offers a smaller surface area available for intermolecular contact and,                    therefore, weaker dispersion forces. Neopentane molecules are the most compact                    of the three, offering the least available surface area for intermolecular                    contact and, hence, the weakest dispersion forces. This behavior is analogous to                    the connections that may be formed between strips of VELCRO brand fasteners: the                    greater the area of the strips contact, the stronger the connection.

106,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,The Nuclear Atom,"The next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a            physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and            England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively            charged alpha particlespositively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons (\xce particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of            radium; \xce particles consist of two protons and two neutrons. Rutherford and his            colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a            beam of \xce particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of            the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering            of the \xce particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an \xce            particle.
positively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons
What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being            deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were            deflected almost straight back toward the source.
Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving \xce particles passed            through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty            space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when            they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like            charges repel one another, the few positively charged \xce particles that changed paths            abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly            concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the            time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing            a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:
This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very            small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is            concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the atom is            electrically neutral. He named this fundamental particle the protonPositively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom., the positively            charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will            learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used            today.

The image in the activity below represents a close-up diagram of Rutherford\'s gold                foil experiment. Drag the description of the observation that Rutherford made to the                place on the diagram that represents that observation.
One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom,            with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different            proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the            existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged            particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found            evidence of neutronsuncharged, subatomic particle located in the nucleus, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same            as that of protons.

107,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Formal Charge and Molecular Structure,"On the previous page, we looked at three different ways to write the Lewis structure for            the thiocyanate ion (SCN-).
All three structures follow the general rules that we discussed previously. So which            structure is correct? Here we will look at how to use the formal charges that we            calculated for each structure to decide which structure is most correct.
The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many            cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one            possible molecular structuredifferent multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements            or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal            charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a            particular molecule or ion:
Let\'s apply these guidelines to our three structures for thiocyanate.
Note that the sum of the formal charges in each case is equal to the charge of the ion            (). However, the first arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest            number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline 2). Also, it places the least            electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative            element (Guideline 3).
Let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know from our            previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central            position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three            possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the            center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:
Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the            left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).
Nitrous oxide, N2O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor                surgeries, such as the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely                structure for nitrous oxide?
Determining formal charge yields the following:
The structure with a terminal oxygen atom best satisfies the criteria for the most                stable distribution of formal charge:
The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no                formal charge larger than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the                preference for having the less electronegative atom in the central position.

108,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Hess\'s Law,"There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure            it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy            changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make            accurate measurements difficult to carry out experimentally. And even when a reaction is            not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat            involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.
Hesss law allows us to relate the enthalpies of different reactions.
If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the                    enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of                    the various steps.
Hesss law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only            on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to            finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon            dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is            written:
We can also consider a two-step process, where first carbon monoxide is formed in the            first step:
In the second step, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical            changes:
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:
According to Hesss law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the            enthalpy changes of the steps. Because, in this case, the first two steps are combustion            reactions, we can use the enthalpies of combustion found on the table on page:                Enthalpies of                Combustion to find the enthalpy change of the entire reaction from            its two steps:
The result is shown in the diagram below. We see that \xceH of the            overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall                \xceH for the reaction = sum of \xceH            values for reaction cstepsd in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and            physical processes.
Before we further practice using Hesss law, let us recall two important features of \xceH.
\xceH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or            products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of                NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ :
When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the \xceH            will be twice as large:
In general, if we multiply (or divide) an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change            should also be multiplied (or divided) by the same number.
\xceH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and            opposite in sign to \xceH for the reaction in the reverse            direction. For example, given that:
Then, for the creversed reaction, the enthalpy change is also creversedd:
Determine the enthalpy of formation, \xceHf of                    FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process                that occurs under standard state conditions:
We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s),                which is equal to \xceH for the reaction:
Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find \xceH is the sum of the two reactions with known \xceH values, so we must sum their \xceHs:
The enthalpy of formation, \xceHf, of                    FeCl3(s) is .5 kJ/mol.
Many times the given steps do not add up to the equation in question and some            manipulation of the equations is required. Here we will look at some such examples.
Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:
Use the reactions here to determine the \xceH for reaction (i):
Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they                add up to reaction (i). Going from left to right in (i), we first see that ClF(g) is                needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (iii) by 1/2,                which means that the \xceH change is also multiplied by 1/2:
Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse                and halve reaction (ii), which means that the \xceH changes sign and is halved:
To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of \xceH:
Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

109,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Introduction to the Periodic Table,"As early chemists worked to purify ores and discovered more elements, they realized that            various elements could be grouped together by their similar chemical behaviors. One such            grouping includes:
These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar            chemical properties.
A second grouping includes:
which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical            properties in common.
However, the specific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each            other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li,            Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen            atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen            atom.
Other elements that exhibit similar properties to each other are:
but the properties of this group of elements are drastically different from those of any            of the groups of elements above.
Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently            recognized that there was a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements            known at that time. Both published tables with the elements arranged according to            increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his            table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to            aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and            germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleevs work. Although Mendeleev and            Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleevs contributions to the development of            the periodic table are now more widely recognized.
By the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved            atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the            periodic law, is as follows: the properties of the elements are periodic functions of            their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the elements in increasing order            of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical            column. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called periods or series,            and 18 vertical columns, called groups. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In            the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However,            IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more            common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14            columns, are usually written below the main body of the table.
You will be using the periodic table frequently throughout this course. For your                    convenience a link to the periodic table will be at the beginning of every                    module, starting with the next one. The periodic table from this link will open                    in a separate tab. It may be a good idea to open it at the beginning of the                    module, as you will likely need it throughout any given module. All calculations                    within this course that use atomic masses as they appear on this periodic table, most of which are rounded                    to the hundredths place. There are many sources of periodic tables online or you                    may want to have a paper copy with which to work. Use whatever works best for                    you.
Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some            elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are            malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires),            and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or            ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into            large classes with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good            conductors of heat and electricityshaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull,            poor conductors of heat and electricityshaded green); and metalloids (elements that            conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and            some properties of nonmetalsshaded purple).
The elements can also be classified into the main-group elements (or representative            elements) in the columns labeled 1, 2, and 13; the transition metals in the columns            labeled 3; and inner transition metals in the two rows at the bottom of the table            (the top-row elements are called lanthanides and the bottom-row elements are actinides.            The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the            composition of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first            column) form compounds that consist of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen.            These elements (except hydrogen) are known as alkali metals, and they all have similar            chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds            consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called            alkaline earth metals, with similar properties among members of that group. Other groups            with specific names are the pnictogens (group 15), chalcogens (group 16), halogens            (group 17), and the noble gases (group 18, also known as inert gases). The groups can            also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can            be called the oxygen group or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element            with properties similar to both group 1 and group 17 elements. For that reason, hydrogen            may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.

110,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Ionization Energies,"The amount of energy required to remove the mostloosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state is called its firstionization energy (IE1 ). The first ionization energy for an element, X, isthe energy required to form a cation with +1 charge:
X(g) \ightarrow X^{+} + e^{-} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{IE}_1
The energy required to remove the second mostloosely bound electron is called the second ionization energy (IE 2 ).
X^{+}(g) \ightarrow X^{2+}(g) + e^{-} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{IE}_2
The energy required to remove the third electron isthe third ionization energy, and so on. Energy is always required to remove electronsfrom atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are alwayspositive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from thenucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, theionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learnedabout radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and toincrease across a period.
The graph below shows the relationship between thefirst ionization energy and the atomic number of several elements. The values of firstionization energy for the elements are given in periodic table below the graph. Within aperiod, the IE1 generally increases with increasing Z. Down a group, the IE value generally decreases with increasing Z. There are some systematicdeviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomicnumber 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclearcharge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy ofthe subshells increases as oneincreases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussedpreviously). Within any one shell, the s electrons are lower in energy than the pelectrons. This means that an s electron is harder to remove from an atom than a pelectron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium([He]2s2 ) is an s electron, whereas the electron removed during theionization of boron ([He]2s22p 1) is a p electron; this resultsin a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greaterby one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring eachtime a new subshell begins.
Another deviation occurs as orbitals become morethan one-half filled. The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than thatfor nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing IE1 values across a period.Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron willeliminate the electronelectron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the 2porbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable).Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods.
Removing an electron from a cation is moredifficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greaterelectrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from acation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electronfrom an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for oneelement always increase. As seen in Table below, there is a large increase in theionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds toremoval of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valenceelectrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so therapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.

111,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Line Spectra,"Another paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late            nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules.            When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of            the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies,            and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is            present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this            fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a            prism to separate them. As can be seen in figure below, sunlight also contains UV light            (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using            instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such            as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all            wavelengths of visible light.
In contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra            having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as            those shown in the figure below. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an            electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs            and neon signs operate in this way. Each element displays its own characteristic set of            lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.
Each emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light            emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric            discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the                H2 molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a            blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating            that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in the            figure below.
Every element has a unique line spectrum, which can be used to identify the element. The            image below shows the line spectra of several elements. Compounds also produce unique            line spectra, but are more complex than the spectra produced by individual elements.
This video shows the line            spectra of several different substances. Note that the diffraction grating used works            like a prism to bend and separate the light so that each individual frequencies can be            seen.
The origin of discrete spectra in atoms and molecules was extremely puzzling to            scientists in the late nineteenth century, since according to classical electromagnetic            theory, only continuous spectra should be observed. Even more puzzling, in 1885, Johann            Balmer was able to derive an empirical equation that related the four visible            wavelengths of light emitted by hydrogen atoms to whole integers. That equation is the            following one, in which k is a constant:
Other discrete lines for the hydrogen atom were found in the UV and IR regions. Johannes            Rydberg generalized Balmer\'s work and developed an empirical formula that predicted all            of hydrogen\'s emission lines, not just those restricted to the visible range, where            n1 and n2 are integers, n1 < n2 and            RH is the Rydberg constant (1.097 m-1).
Even in the late nineteenth century, spectroscopy was a very precise science, and so the            wavelengths of hydrogen were measured to very high accuracy, which implied that the            Rydberg constant could be determined very precisely as well. That such a simple formula            as the Rydberg formula could account for such precise measurements seemed astounding at            the time, but it was the eventual explanation for emission spectra by Neils Bohr in 1913            that ultimately convinced scientists to abandon classical physics and spurred the            development of modern quantum mechanics.

112,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Non-Ideal Gas Behavior,"Thus far, the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, has beenapplied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from reaction stoichiometryand empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar massof a gas. As mentioned previously, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal,meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperatureare not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for thesedeviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.
The KMT assumes that the volume of gas particles iszero. This assumption can be made because the volume of the individual gas particles isnegligible compared to the volume of the container that the gas is in. Observe in theanimation below that as the pressure of the gas increases the volume of the gasparticles will take up a larger percentage of the container. Therefore as pressureincreases, gases become less ideal. Gas volumes predicted by the ideal gas equation willbe slightly larger than the actual volume. As pressure increases this difference willbecome greater. The difference becomes very significant at 10 atm.
Animation developed from PhET InteractiveSimulations, University of Colorado Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu
The graph below shows the measured values of PV/RTfor 1 mole of several different gases at 300 K and varying pressures. Note that thehorizontal line at 1.0 represents the value that would be calculated for PV/RT for eachof the given gases. As the pressure increases, generally speaking, the differencebetween the measured value and the value calculated by the ideal gas law increases.
A graph of the compressibility factor (Z)vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from thebehavior predicted by the ideal gas law.
The KMT also assumes that there are no attractiveforces between particles. Like the assumption about volume, under certain conditionsthis is for practical purposes true. At higher temperatures the attractive forcesbetween the gas particles is negligible and can be ignored. However, when a gas iscooled the particles begin to move more slowly. As the particles are moving more slowly,these attractive forces become more significant. Eventually at some temperature(depending on the gas) the attractive forces will become so significant that the gaswill condense to a liquid.
As temperature decreases the gas particlesmove more slowly. As the particles move more slowly, attractive forces betweenthe particles become more significant. Eventually, if the gas is cooled enoughthe attractive forces will become so significant and cause the gas to condenseinto a liquid.

(a) Attractions between gas moleculesserve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure compared to an ideal gaswhose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forceswill decrease the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls,therefore reducing the pressure exerted compared to an ideal gas.

113,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Partial Pressure of Gases,"Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases            do not affect each others pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same            pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container. The pressure            exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressurepressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture. This            observation is summarized by Daltons law of partial pressures.
pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture
The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial                pressures of the component gases:
P_{Total} = P_A + P_B + P_C + ... = \\Sigma_iP_i 
In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases,                    PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial                pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its            mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component            of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:
P_A = X_A \imes P_{Total} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{where}\\ X_A =                \\frac{n_A}{n_{Total}}
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole            fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the            number of moles of all components in the mixture.
A 10.0L vessel contains 2.50 -3 mol of H2, 1.00 -3 mol                of He, and 3.00 -4 mol of Ne at 35 C.
(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?
(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?
The gases behave independently, so the partial pressure of each gas can be determined                from the ideal gas equation, using:
P = \\frac{nRT}V.
\equire{cancel} P_{H_2} = \\frac{(2.50 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 6.32 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\mathrm{atm}
\equire{cancel} P_{H_e} = \\frac{(1.00 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 2.53 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\mathrm{atm}
\equire{cancel} P_{N_e} = \\frac{(3.00 \imes 10^{-4}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 7.58 \imes 10^{-4}                    \\mathrm{atm}
The total pressure is given by the sum of the partial pressures:
P_T = P_{H_2} + P_{H_e} + P_{N_e} = (0.00632 + 0.00253 + 0.00076)                    \\mathrm{atm} = 9.61 \imes 10^{-3} \\mathrm{atm}
Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.
A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41                mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.
(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?
(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?
The mole fraction is given by XA = nA/nTotal and the                partial pressure is PA = XA  PTotal.
For O2,
X_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{2.83 \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41)                    \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.252
and
P_{O_2} = X_{O_2} \imes P_{Total} = 0.252 \imes 192 \\mathrm{kPa} = 48.4                    \\mathrm{kPa}
For N2O,
X_{N_2O} = \\frac{n_{N_2O}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{8.41                    \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41) \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.748
and
P_{N_2O} = X_{N_2O} \imes P_{Total} = 0.748 \imes 192 \\mathrm{kPa} =                    143.6 \\mathrm{kPa}

114,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Percent Yield,"The amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as            calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriately balanced chemical equation, is            called the theoretical yieldamount of product that may be produced from a given amount of reactant(s) according to the reaction stoichiometry of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product            obtained is called the actual yieldamount of product formed in a reaction, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for            a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by            side reactions that generate other products. Some products are difficult to collect            without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The            extent to which a reactions theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its            percent yieldmeasure of the efficiency of a reaction, expressed as a percentage of the theoretical yield.

115,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Phase Diagrams,"On the previous page, the variation of a liquids equilibrium vapor pressure with            temperature was described. Considering the definition of boiling point, plots of vapor            pressure versus temperature represent how the boiling point of the liquid varies with            pressure. Also described was the use of heating and cooling curves to determine a            substances melting (or freezing) point. Making such measurements over a wide range of            pressures yields data that may be presented graphically as a phase diagram. A phase            diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the liquid-gas, solid-liquid,            and solid-gas phase-transition equilibria of a substance. These diagrams indicate the            physical states that exist under specific conditions of pressure and temperature, and            also provide the pressure dependence of the phase-transition temperatures (melting            points, sublimation points, boiling points). A typical phase diagram for a pure            substance is shown below.
To illustrate the utility of these plots, consider the phase diagram for water shown            below. Click through each of the green dots to get more information.
We can use the phase diagram to identify the physical state of a sample of water under            specified conditions of pressure and temperature. For example, a pressure of 50 kPa and            a temperature of  C correspond to the region of the diagram labeled cice.d Under            these conditions, water exists only as a solid (ice). A pressure of 50 kPa and a            temperature of 50 C correspond to the cwaterd regionhere, water exists only as a            liquid. At 25 kPa and 200 C, water exists only in the gaseous state. Note that on the                H2O phase diagram, the pressure and temperature axes are not drawn to a            constant scale in order to permit the illustration of several important features as            described here.
Consider the phase diagram for carbon dioxide shown below as another example. The            solid-liquid curve exhibits a positive slope, indicating that the melting point for CO2            increases with pressure as it does for most substances. Notice that the triple point is well above 1 atm, indicating            that carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid under ambient pressure conditions. Instead,            cooling gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm results in its deposition into the solid state.            Likewise, solid carbon dioxide does not melt at 1 atm pressure but instead sublimes to            yield gaseous CO2. Finally, notice that the critical point for carbon dioxide is            observed at a relatively modest temperature and pressure in comparison to water.
If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 C, remove the air, and let the                    vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of                    liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the                    more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the                    temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas                    curve in the phase diagram for water, and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and                    gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218                    atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the                    boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now                    present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of                    the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and                    the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point                    . Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much                    pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature                    is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of                    some common substances are given in the table below.

116,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules,"Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these            interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange            information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or            feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between            chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to            classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module            will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions:            precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.
A precipitation reactionreaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more)            solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic            compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement,            double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and            are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in            animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and            specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical            analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric            methods for determining the composition of matter. Watch the video below to see an example of a precipitation reaction.
reaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is            quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a            substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively            large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution            conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with            relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that            readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is            provided later in this course. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids            formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that            have been observed for many ionic compounds. Note that these guidelines are not            comprehensive, they do not cover every possible combination of cations and anions. It is            a good idea to memorize these guidelines.
Determine the solubility of the following compounds:
a) AgNO3
b) BaSO4
c) CaCO3
a) Nitrates are always soluble.
b) While sulfate compounds are often soluble, exceptions include: Ag+,                    Hg22+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Sr2+,                    Ba2+
c) Carbonate compounds are insoluble unless combined with a cation that is always                soluble.
We use these solubility rules to predict whether or not a precipitation reaction will            occur between two ionic compounds. A vivid example of precipitation is observed when            solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of            solid lead(II) iodide:
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble            compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general            solubility of iodide salts.
The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:
Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artists pigment known            as iodine yellow. The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for            fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
In order to determine whether or not a precipitation reaction will occur one needs to            identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion            pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver            nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing Ag+,                NO3, Na+, and F ions. Aside from the            two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two            additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3            and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgF            is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation            reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
potassium sulfate and barium nitrate
K+, SO42, Ba2+,                        NO3
KNO3 and BaSO4
If any of the possible products are insoluble a precipitate will form.
This reaction will form a precipitate of BaSO4. Therefore, the net ionic                equation is:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
sodium carbonate and ammonium nitrate
Na+, CO32, NH4+,                        NO3
NaNO3 and (NH4)2CO3
If all possible products are soluble, no reaction occurs.
The ions present in the reactants will remain unchanged when these two aqueous                solutions are combined. No reaction will occur.

117,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Pressure-Volume Work,"A type of work called pressure-volume work occurs when a system pushes back the            surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the            system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine.            The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as            heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder.
The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of            the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing            work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep            the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine            is running.)
The work done on the surroundings by the system or on the system by the surroundings can            be calculated with the following equation:
Where                                     Δ                    V                                         =                                                                 V                        final                                                             −                                                                 V                        initial                                                
The negative sign in the above equation is present because when the gas expands (when                    \xceV                is positive), the system does work on the surroundings (w                is negative).
Since we know we can calculate E                    using
If the work done on the system or by the system in a given process is pressure-volume                    work then:",,what's the relationship between the surroundings and the system?,40.28852081298828
118,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Significant Figures in Calculations,"A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement            are at least as uncertain as the measurement itself. We must take the uncertainty in our            measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated            results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct            number of significant figures, which is determined by the following four rules for            rounding numbers:
When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same                            number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal                            places (i.e., the least certain value in terms of addition and                            subtraction).
Add 1.0023 g and 4.383 g.
The answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is 5.385 g (round to                the thousandths place; three decimal places)
Subtract 421.23 g from 486 g.
The answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is is 65 g (round to                the ones place; no decimal places)
When we multiply or divide numbers, we should round the result to the                            same number of digits as the number with the least number of significant                            figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and                            division).
Multiply 0.6238 cm and 6.60 cm.
When these values are multiplied, we get 4.11708 cm2. The least certain                measurement has 3 significant figures. The final answer should be rounded to three                significant figures. The final answer rounded to the correct number of significant                figures is 4.12 cm2.
Divide 421.23 g by 48 mL.
When these values are divided we get 8.775625 g/mL. The least certain measurement has                2 significant figures. The final answer should be rounded to two significant                figures. The final answer rounded to the correct number of significant figures is                8.8 g/mL.
In the midst of all these technicalities, it is important to keep in mind the reason why            we use significant figures and rounding rulesto correctly represent the uncertainty of            the values we report and to ensure that a calculated result is not represented as being            more certain than the least certain value used in the calculation.

119,Solutions,Solubility,Solubility,"Imagine adding a small amount of salt to a glass of water, stirring until all the salt            has dissolved, and then adding a bit more. You can repeat this process until the salt            concentration of the solution reaches its natural limit, a limit determined primarily by            the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent            attractive forces. You can be certain that you have reached this limit because, no            matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved salt remains. The concentration of            salt in the solution at this point is known as its solubility.
The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may            be achieved under given conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium.            Referring to the example of salt in water:
When a solutes concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be            saturated with that solute. If the solutes concentration is less than its solubility,            the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that contains a relatively low            concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration            is called concentrated.
If we add more salt to a saturated solution of salt, we see it fall to the bottom and no            more seems to dissolve. In fact, the added salt does dissolve, as represented by the            forward direction of the dissolution equation. Accompanying this process, dissolved salt            will precipitate, as depicted by the reverse direction of the equation. The system is            said to be at equilibrium when these two reciprocal processes are occurring at equal            rates, and so the amount of undissolved and dissolved salt remains constant.
Solutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such            solutions are said to be supersaturated, and they are interesting examples of            nonequilibrium states. For example, the carbonated beverage in an open container that            has not yet cgone flatd is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO2            concentration will decrease until it reaches its equilibrium value. A video showing the crystallization of             two supersaturated solutions of sodium acetate is shown below.

120,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,The Spin Quantum Number,"The other three quantum numbers, n, l,            and ml, are properties of specific atomic orbitals            that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located.            Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrdinger equation for electrons in atoms. The            electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon            with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving            the Schrdinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as            the Cartesian x, y, and z). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron crotationd or            cspinning.d Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an            angular momentum, even though this rotation cannot be observed in terms of the spatial            coordinates.
The magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can            only cspind in one of two quantized states. One is termed the \xce state, with the z            component of the spin being in the positive direction of the z axis. This corresponds to            the spin quantum number ms = \\(\\\). The other is called            the \xce state, with the z component of the spin being negative and ms = \\(\\\). Any electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is            located in, can only have one of those two values of the spin quantum number. The            energies of electrons having ms = \\(\\\) and ms = \\(\\\) are different if an external magnetic field            is applied.
The image below illustrates this phenomenon. An electron acts like a tiny magnet. Its            moment is directed up (in the positive direction of the z axis)            for the \\(\\\) spin quantum number and down (in the negative z            direction) for the spin quantum number of \\(\\\). A magnet has a lower energy if its            magnetic moment is aligned with the external magnetic field (the left electron on the            image below) and a higher energy for the magnetic moment being opposite to the applied            field. This is why an electron with ms = \\(\\\) has a            slightly lower energy in an external field in the positive z direction, and an electron            with ms = \\(\\\) has a slightly higher energy in the            same field. This is true even for an electron occupying the same orbital in an atom. A            spectral line corresponding to a transition for electrons from the same orbital but with            z different spin quantum numbers has two possible values of energy; thus, the line in            the spectrum will show a fine structure splitting.
An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l,                        ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the                    orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property                    called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle                    that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general                    behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated                    as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of                    all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the                    same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but                    only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values. Since                    the spin quantum number can only have two values (\\(\\\)), no more than two                    electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the                    same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can                    be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.

121,Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter,Module Summary and Quiz,"Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building                     block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter                     into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances,                     atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three                     states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but                     fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature                     conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is                     composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts                     and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in composition                     from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to                     point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be                     an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by                     a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms.
                                        All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo                     physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point,                     and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the                     composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and                     chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from                     that present beforehand.

122,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded                    Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram. These diagrams represent each                    orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an                    arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow                    to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate                    two electrons of opposite spin.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created                    orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets                    one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired                    electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap                    during the formation of the BeCl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a                    molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom                    in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in                        Zn(CH3)2, which contains a linear CZnC arrangement,                    and the carbon atom in CO2.
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron                    density consist of a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one                    unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2                    hybridization, the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three                    identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry.
Although quantum mechanics yields the cplumpd orbital lobes as depicted,                    sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor                    lobes, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use                    these cthinnerd representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily                    visualize.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests                        sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is                    trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen                    atoms. We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in                    an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH3 as shown in the                    orbital energy level diagram. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the                    boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron                    pairs with a hydrogen electron when BH bonds form.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit                        sp2 hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on                    the central atom, such as ClNO, or molecules with two single bonds and a double                    bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O.
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of                    bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four sp3 hybrid                    orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p                    orbitals that produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each of                    these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by                    four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane                    exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron                    distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in                    CH4. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed                    equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen                    electron when the CH bonds form.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps                    with one of the four sp3 orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma                    () bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent                    bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the                    methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of                    methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the                    corners of a tetrahedronthree hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. However, in                    ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an                        sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form a  bond between the                    two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps                    with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen  bonds. The                    structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane. The orientation                    of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other.                    Experimental evidence shows that rotation around  bonds occurs easily.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The                    nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by                    the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen                    atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5, but the                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3) and water (104.5) are slightly smaller.                    Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,                        PCl3, and NCl3.
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid                    orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six                    valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of                    the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not                    those in the first or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five PCl                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the PCl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and                    the chlorine atoms in ClF3 and in ClF4+. (The                    electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2                    hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of                    electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no                    lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s                    orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals form six equivalent                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a                    different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in                        PCl6, the iodine atom in the interhalogens                        IF6+, IF5, ICl4,                        IF4 and the xenon atom in XeF4.

123,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Volume and Temperature,"If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount                    of air at atmospheric pressure, lets say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a                    refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both                    the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very                    cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.
These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a                    confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as                    the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.                    Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed                    and graphed.
The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at                    constant pressure is known as Charless law in recognition of the French                    scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre Csar Charles.
Charless law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly                            proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is                            held constant.
Mathematically, this can be written as:
*Note that temperatures must be in units of kelvin for any gas law                            calculation.
A sample of carbon dioxide, CO2, occupies 0.300 L at 10.0 C and 750 torr.                What volume will the gas have at 30.0 C and 750 torr?
Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at                constant pressure, this is a job for Charless law.

124,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Clausius-Clapeyron Equation,"The quantitative relation between a substances            vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
P\\;=\\;Ae^{-\\Delta H_{vap}/RT}
where \xceHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization for the            liquid, R is the gas constant, and A is a constant whose value depends on the chemical            identity of the substance. Temperature T must be in Kelvin in this equation. This            equation is often rearranged into logarithmic form to yield the linear equation:
\\ln\\;P\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT}+\\;\\ln\\;A
This linear equation may be expressed in a            two-point format that is convenient for use in various computations, as demonstrated in            the example exercises that follow. If at temperature T1, the vapor pressure            is P1, and at temperature T2, the vapor pressure is P2,            the corresponding linear equations are:
\\ln\\;P_1\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT_1}+\\;\\ln\\;A\\; \ext{and} \\;\\ln\\;P_2\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT_2}+\\;\\ln\\;A
Since the constant, A, is the same, these two            equations may be rearranged to isolate ln A and then set them equal to one another:

Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) has an                octane rating of 100. It is used as one of the standards for the octane-rating                system for gasoline. At 34.0 C, the vapor pressure of isooctane is 10.0 kPa, and at                98.8 C, its vapor pressure is 100.0 kPa. Use this information to estimate the                enthalpy of vaporization for isooctane.
The enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap,                can be determined by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta                H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\ight)
Since we have two vapor pressure-temperature                values (T1 = 34.0 C = 307.2 K, P1 = 10.0 kPa and                T2 = 98.8 C = 372.0 K, P2 = 100 kPa), we can substitute                them into this equation and solve for \xceHvap. Rearranging the                Clausius-Clapeyron equation and solving for \xceHvap yields:
\\Delta                H_{vap}=\\frac{R\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}\ight)}{\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\ight)}=\\;\\frac{(8.314\\;\\mathrm                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm                K)\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{100.\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}{10.0\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}}\ight)}{\\left(\{307.2\\;\\mathrm                K}-\{372.0\\;\\mathrm K}\ight)}\\;=33,800\\;\\mathrm                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\;=\\;33.8\\;\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{mol}
Note that the pressure can be in any units, so                long as they agree for both P values, but the temperature must be in kelvin for the                Clausius-Clapeyron equation to be valid.
For benzene (C6H6), the                normal boiling point is 80.1 C and the enthalpy of vaporization is 30.8 kJ/mol.                What is the boiling point of benzene in Denver, where atmospheric pressure = 83.4                kPa?
Solution
If the temperature and vapor pressure are known                at one point, along with the enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap, then the temperature                that corresponds to a different vapor pressure (or the vapor pressure that                corresponds to a different temperature) can be determined by using the                Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta                H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\ight)
Since the normal boiling point is the                temperature at which the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure at sea level, we                know one vapor pressure-temperature value (T1 = 80.1 C = 353.3 K,                P1 = 101.3 kPa, \xceHvap = 30.8 kJ/mol) and want to find the                temperature (T2) that corresponds to vapor pressure P2 = 83.4                kPa. We can substitute these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and then                solve for T2. Rearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and solving for                T2 yields:

125,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Gravimetric Analysis,"A gravimetric analysis is a process in which a sample is subjected to some treatment that            causes a change in the physical state of the analyte that permits its separation from            the other components of the sample. Mass measurements of the sample, the isolated            analyte, or some other component of the analysis system, used along with the known            stoichiometry of the compounds involved, permit calculation of the analyte            concentration. Gravimetric methods were the first techniques used for quantitative            chemical analysis, and they remain important tools in the modern chemistry            laboratory.
The required change of state in a gravimetric analysis may be achieved by various            physical and chemical processes. A common gravimetric technique is one in which the            analyte is subjected to a precipitation reaction. The precipitate is typically isolated            from the reaction mixture by filtration, carefully dried, and then weighed. The mass of            the precipitate may then be used, along with relevant stoichiometric relationships, to            calculate analyte amount and/or concentration. Watch the video below to see the            gravimetric analysis process involving the precipitation of analyte in detail.

126,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Combustion Analysis,"The elemental composition of hydrocarbons and            related compounds may be determined via a gravimetric method known as combustion            analysis. In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high            temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield            gaseous products of known identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for            example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only products. The gaseous            combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing            compounds that selectively absorb each product, as shown in the figure below. The mass            increase of each device corresponds to the mass of the absorbed product and may be used            in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the relevant            element.
This schematic diagram illustrates the                basic components of a combustion analysis device for determining the carbon and                hydrogen content of a sample.
Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to                produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic items. A combustion                analysis of a 0.00126 g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2                and 0.00161 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?
The primary assumption in this exercise is that                all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon dioxide, and all the                hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:
{\\mathrm C}_x{\\mathrm                H}_y\\mathit(s\\mathit)+excess\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)\\longrightarrow                x\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)+\\frac y2\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O(g)\\;\\;
Note that a balanced equation is not necessary                for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the compound, only the                subscripts x and y are needed.
First, calculate the molar amounts of carbon                and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the carbon dioxide and                water, respectively. With these molar amounts, the empirical formula for the                compound may be written as described in an earlier unit. An outline of this                approach is given in the following flow chart:

127,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Accuracy and Precision,"Scientists typically make repeated measurements ofa quantity to ensure the quality of their findings and to know both the precisionhow closely a measurement matches the same measurement when repeated and the accuracyhow closely a measurement aligns with a correct value of their results. Measurements are said to be precise if they yield verysimilar results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurateif it yields a result that is very close to the true or accepted value. Precise valuesagree with each other; accurate values agree with a true value. These characterizationscan be extended to other contexts, such as the results of an archery competition.

Suppose a quality control chemist at apharmaceutical company is tasked with checking the accuracy and precision of threedifferent machines that are meant to dispense 10 ounces (296 mL) of cough syrup intostorage bottles.

Considering these results, she will report thatdispenser #1 is precise (values all close to one another, within a few tenths of amilliliter) but not accurate (none of the values are close to the target value of 296mL, each being more than 10 mL too low). Results for dispenser #2 represent improvedaccuracy (each volume is less than 3 mL away from 296 mL) but worse precision (volumesvary by more than 4 mL). Finally, she can report that dispenser #3 is working well,dispensing cough syrup both accurately (all volumes within 0.1 mL of the target volume)and precisely (volumes differing from each other by no more than 0.2 mL).
Let's take another look at the table in theexercise above. The results of Anita's measurements, which are neither accurate norprecise, represent random error. Random errorError produced from a series of measurement where there is no observablepattern in the results. occurs when the results of a series of measurements produce no observablepattern. Notice that in Anita's measurements some of the values are below theaccepted value and some are above.
Error produced from a series of measurement where there is no observablepattern in the results.
If we consider Lynette's measured values, wesee that they are precise, but not accurate. This type of data represents systematicerror. Systematic errorError in a series of data in which there is an observable pattern. occurs when the results of a series of measurements produces an observablepattern. Each of Lynette's measurements is less than the accepted value byapproximately the same amount.
Error in a series of data in which there is an observable pattern.
When systematic error is present, it is oftenpossible to pinpoint the source of the error. In Lynette's measurements, it may bepossible that the balance she used to measure the mass of the copper is off byapproximately 1.7 g. This would be something that would be prudent for Lynette to checkto see if she could determine the source of her error. With random error on the otherhand, it is difficult if not impossible to determine the source of the error. Whileideally data that is collected in an investigation is both accurate and precise, datawhich shows systematic error is preferable to that which shows random error.

In this                    context, an                         acid                                                                                    substance that produces H3O+ when dissolved                                    in water                                                                         is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions,                        H3O+. As an example, consider the equation shown                    here:
substance that produces H3O+ when dissolved                                    in water
The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an                    acid. When dissolved in water, H3O+ ions are produced by a                    chemical reaction in which H+ ions are transferred from HCl molecules                    to H2O molecules.
The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is                    essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water                    will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are                    called                         strong acids                                                                                    acids that reacts completely when dissolved in water to yield                                    hydronium ions                                                                        , and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are                    classified as strong, as seen in the table below. A far greater number of                    compounds behave as                         weak acids                                                                                    acids that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved in water                                    to yield hydronium ions                                                                         and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of                    dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small                    amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being                    the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the                    stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with                    body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient                    in food vinegars:
acids that reacts completely when dissolved in water to yield                                    hydronium ions
acids that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved in water                                    to yield hydronium ions
When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid                    molecules are present in the ionized form,                        CH3CO2 . (The use of a double-arrow in the                    equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept                    addressed fully later in this course).
A                                 base                                                                                                            substance that produces OH when dissolved in                                            water                                                                                                 is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide                            ions, OH. The most common bases are ionic compounds composed                            of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with                            the hydroxide ionfor example, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. When these                            compounds dissolve in water, hydroxide ions are released directly into                            the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)2 dissolve in water                            and dissociate completely to produce cations (K+ and                                Ba2+, respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH.                            These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in                            water, are considered                                 strong bases                                                                                                            bases that reacts completely when dissolved in water to                                            yield hydroxide ions                                                                                                .

bases that reacts completely when dissolved in water to                                            yield hydroxide ions
Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in                            water:
This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in                            water, NaOH dissociates to yield Na+ and OH ions.                            This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide                            ions. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic                            compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other                            ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.
Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when                            dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases,                            these compounds react only partially and so are classified as                                 weak bases                                                                                                            bases that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved                                            in water to yield hydroxide ions                                                                                                . These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and                            important commodities in various technologies. For example, global                            production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric                            tons annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw                            material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active                            ingredient in household cleaners. When dissolved in water, ammonia                            reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here:
bases that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved                                            in water to yield hydroxide ions
This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the                            transfer of H+ ions from water molecules to ammonia                            molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved                            ammonia is present as NH4+ ions.
The chemical reactions described in which acids and bases dissolved in                            water produce hydronium and hydroxide ions, respectively, are, by                            definition, acid-base reactions. In these reactions, water serves as                            both a solvent and a reactant. A neutralization reaction is a specific                            type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a                            base, the products are often a salt and water, and neither reactant is                            the water itself:
To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a                            typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an aqueous suspension of solid                                Mg(OH)2 is ingested to ease symptoms associated with                            excess stomach acid (HCl):
Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium                            chloride.
Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the                                following reaction:
The weak acid hydrogen hypochlorite reacts with water.
The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H2O. Since the                                substance is reported to be an acid, its reaction with water will                                involve the transfer of H+ from HOCl to H2O to                                generate hydronium ions, H3O+ and hypochlorite                                ions, OCl.
A double-arrow is appropriate in this equation because it indicates                                the HOCl is a weak acid that has not reacted completely.
Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the                                following reaction:
A solution of barium hydroxide is neutralized with a solution of                                nitric acid.
The two reactants are provided, Ba(OH)2 and                                    HNO3. Since this is a neutralization reaction, the                                two products will be water and a salt composed of the cation of the                                ionic hydroxide (Ba2+) and the anion generated when the                                acid transfers its hydrogen ion (NO3).

129,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,The Bohr Model of the Atom,"Following the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth            century, the picture of atoms consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and            even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus was well established. This            picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature csolar            systemd with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. This            classical mechanics description of the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron            moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing direction) and,            according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic            radiation. This loss in orbital energy should result in the electrons orbit getting            continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus, implying that atoms are            inherently unstable.
In 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical            electromagnetisms prediction that the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously            emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics description of the            atom Plancks ideas of quantization and Einsteins finding that light consists of            photons whose energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron            orbiting the nucleus would not normally emit any radiation (the stationary state            hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different orbit. The            energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies.
Bohr assumed that only discrete values for these could occur. Bohr was able to calculate            the energies of each orbital and he found that they fit the following equation:
In this expression, k is a constant comprising fundamental constants of Ryberg\'s contant,            Plancks constant and the speed of light ( k = (hcRH) =            2.18-18 J ). The energies of the orbitals calculated are seen in the            image below. Notice that as the more negative the calculated value, the lower the energy            with n = 1 having the most negative value, which means it has the lowest energy.
One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is most stable with the lowest            possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit,            the orbit in which it has the lowest energy.             When the electron is in this lowest energy            orbit, the atom is said to be in its ground electronic statestate in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible (or simply ground state). If the            atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for the electron to move to            an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic statestate having an energy greater than the ground-state energy (or            simply an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an            excited state (higher energy orbit) to a less excited state, or ground state, the            difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed by an            atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more            excited one.
state in which the electrons in an atom, ion, or molecule have the lowest energy possible
state having an energy greater than the ground-state energy
We can relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about            energy. The law of conservation of energy says that we can neither create nor destroy            energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite an electron            from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the            electron returns to its initial state. In effect, an atom can cstored energy by using it            to promote an electron to a state with a higher energy and release it when the electron            returns to a lower state. The energy can be released as one quantum of energy, as the            electron returns to its ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 1), or it can be released            as two or more smaller quanta as the electron falls to an intermediate state, then to            the ground state (say, from n = 5 to n = 4, emitting one quantum, then to n = 1,            emitting a second quantum).

130,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Chemical Reactions,"When we use calorimetry to determine the heat involved in a chemical reaction, the same            principles we have been discussing apply. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter            is often small enough that we can neglect it (though not for highly accurate            measurements, as discussed later), and the calorimeter minimizes energy exchange with            the surroundings. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical            reaction, there is no overall energy change during the reaction. The heat produced or            consumed in the reaction (the csystemd), qreaction, plus the heat absorbed or lost by            the solution (the csurroundingsd), qsolution, must add up to zero:
This means that the amount of heat produced or consumed in the reaction equals the amount            of heat absorbed or lost by the solution:
This concept lies at the heart of all calorimetry problems and calculations.
When 50.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl(aq) and 50.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH(aq), both at 22.0 C, are                added to a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum                of 28.9 C. What is the approximate amount of heat produced by this reaction?
To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so                quickly that no reaction took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the                reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have 100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl                and NaOH at 22.0 C. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution temperature                reaches 28.9 C.
The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution.                Therefore:
(It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter                does not absorb any heat from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between                the calorimeter and its surroundings.)
Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat,                mass, and temperature change:
To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions                or approximations. Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water                in terms of its specific heat and mass values. The density of water is approximately                1.0 g/mL, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about 1.0  g (two significant                figures). The specific heat of water is approximately 4.184 J/g C, so we use that                for the specific heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives:
Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have:
The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic. It produces 2.89 kJ of                heat.
If the amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is too large to neglect or if we                    require more accurate results, then we must take into account the heat absorbed                    both by the solution and by the calorimeter.
The calorimeters described above are designed to operate at constant (atmospheric)                    pressure and are convenient to measure heat flow accompanying processes that                    occur in solution. A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant                    volume, colloquially known as a bomb calorimeterdevice designed to measure the energy change for processes occurring under conditions of constant volume; commonly used for reactions involving solid and gaseous reactants or products, is used to measure the energy                    produced by reactions that yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products,                    such as combustion reactions. (The term cbombd comes from the observation that                    these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage                    other calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel                    container (the cbombd) that contains the reactants and is itself submerged in                    water, as seen in the image below. The sample is placed in the bomb, which is                    then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to                    ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is trapped in the steel                    bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along                    with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy                    produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the                    heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. Once the heat                    capacity of the bomb calorimeter is determined, this is taken into consideration                    in the calculation for qreaction.

qbomb is calculated by multiplying the                            heat capacity of the bomb, as determined by calibration, and the observed                            change in temperature caused by the reaction.
When 3.12 g of glucose, C6H12O6, is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the                        temperature of the calorimeter increases from 23.8 C to 35.6 C. The                        calorimeter contains 775 g of water, and the bomb itself has a heat capacity                        of 893 J/C. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the glucose                        sample?
The combustion produces heat that is primarily absorbed by the water and the                        bomb. (The amounts of heat absorbed by the reaction products and the                        unreacted excess oxygen are relatively small and dealing with them is beyond                        the scope of this online course. We will neglect them in our calculations.)
The heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the water and the bomb:
= [(4.184 J/g C)(775g)  (35.6 C.8 C)] + [893 J/C  (35.6 C.8 C)]
= (38,300 J + 10,500 J)
,800 J = .8 kJ
This reaction released 48.7 kJ of heat when 3.12 g of glucose was burned.",,what is the correct amount of heat to be produced in a reaction?,31.12246322631836
131,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Chemical Formulas,"A molecular formulaA representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule. is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to            indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each            type in the molecule. (A subscript is used only when more than one atom of a given type            is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of            compounds.

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the            atoms.

Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular            formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine                (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent            distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the            element titanium.
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the            molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
If we know a compounds formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives            vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

132,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Units of Solution Concentration: Mass and Volume Percentage,"In the previous section, we introduced molarity, a very useful measurement unit for            evaluating the concentration of solutions. However, molarity is only one measure of            concentration. In this section, we will introduce some other units of concentration that            are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention.
Earlier, we introduced percent composition as a measure of the relative amount of                    a given element in a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the                    composition of mixtures, including solutions. The mass percentageratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage                       of a solution                    component is defined as the ratio of the components mass to the solutions                    mass, expressed as a percentage.
ratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage
We are generally most interested in the mass percentages of solutes, but it is                    also possible to compute the mass percentage of solvent.
Mass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass,                    percent weight, weight/weight percent, and other variations on this theme. The                    most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the percent sign, %, although                    more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use                    of these more detailed symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with                    other types of percentages, such as volume percentages (to be discussed later in                    this section).
Mass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label                    of a typical liquid bleach bottle cites the concentration of its active                    ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being 7.4%. A 100.0g sample of                    bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.
A 5.0g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What                        is the percent by mass of glucose in spinal fluid?
Substituting the given masses into the equation defining mass percentage                        yields:
Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg,                        g, kg, oz, and so on), the same unit must be used for both the solute and                        the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio.                        In this case, we converted the units of solute in the numerator from mg to g                        to match the units in the denominator. We could just as easily have                        converted the denominator from g to mg instead. As long as identical mass                        units are used for both solute and solution, the computed mass percentage                        will be correct.
cConcentratedd hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is                        commonly used as a laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19                        g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution?
In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage,                        we need to know the corresponding mass of the solution. Using the solution                        density given, we can convert the solutions volume to mass, and then use                        the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical                        approach is outlined in this flowchart:
For proper unit cancellation, the 0.500 L volume is converted into 500 mL,                        and the mass percentage is expressed as a ratio, 37.2g HCl/g solution:
Liquid volumes over a wide range of magnitudes are conveniently measured                            using common and relatively inexpensive laboratory equipment. The                            concentration of a solution formed by dissolving a liquid solute in a                            liquid solvent is therefore often expressed as a volume percentageratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage, %vol                            or (v/v)%.
ratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage
Rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) is usually sold as a 70% vol aqueous                                solution. If the density of isopropyl alcohol is 0.785 g/mL, how                                many grams of isopropyl alcohol are present in a 355 mL bottle of                                rubbing alcohol?
Per the definition of volume percentage, the isopropanol volume is                                70% of the total solution volume. Multiplying the isopropanol volume                                by its density yields the requested mass:

133,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Dipole-Dipole Attractions,"Recall from the unit on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that polar molecules have            a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of            the moleculea separation of charge called a dipole. Consider a polar molecule such as            hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl atom bears the            partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial            positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction            between the positive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This            attractive force is called a dipole-dipole attractionthe electrostatic force between            the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of            another, as illustrated below.
The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of            HCl molecules to nonpolar F2 molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of            the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass. At a            temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE.            However, the dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause            them to cstick togetherd to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion            forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are not, and so this substance is            gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to                F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole            attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar                F2 molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing            points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths            of IMFs of attraction present within different substances.
Predict which will have the higher boiling point: N2 or CO. Explain your                reasoning.
CO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience                similar London dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences                dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit                dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO molecules are                comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO                is expected to have the higher boiling point.

134,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Electron Affinities,"The electron affinity [EA] is the energy change forthe process of adding an electron to a gaseous atom to form an anion (negative ion).
X(g) + e^- \ightarrow X^-(g) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{EA}_1
This process can be either endothermic orexothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is given inperiodic table below. You can see that many of these elements have negative values ofEA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron.However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively chargedand the value of their EA is positive. (It is important to note that the more negative avalue for EA the greater its EA. The values indicate the magnitude of energy change, thesign indicates the direction.) Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values areassociated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associatedwith adding an electron to an anion to form a  ion, and so on.
As we might predict, it becomes easier to add anelectron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atomsincreases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become morenegative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), andgroup 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. Thenoble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electronmust be added to a higher n level, which is more difficult to do. Group 2 (2A) has afilled ns subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy np, so,again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A)has a half-filled np subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing npelectron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electronconfiguration disrupts the trend in EA.
We also might expect the atom at the top of eachgroup to have the largest EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atomshave the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we seethat the second element in the group most often has the greatest EA. The reduction ofthe EA of the first member can be attributed to the small size of the n = 2 shell andthe resulting large electronelectron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EAvalue of  kJ/mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EAof fluorine is  kJ/mol. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form afluoride anion (F  ), we add an electron to the n = 2 shell. The electron isattracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the otherelectrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the sameelectron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is goinginto the n = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and theelectronelectron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience asmuch repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily.
The properties discussed in this module (size ofatoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities)are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has anenergetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is mucheasier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivityand malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons thatcan be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group anddecreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it iseasier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.

135,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Module Summary and Quiz,"Energy is the capacity to do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE)        is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position,        composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy        is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of        thermodynamics).
The total of all energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (E). As a            system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred            from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. The change            in internal energy of a system can be determined from the equation \xceE = q + w. When the work done            by or on the system is pressure-volume work, the change in internal energy is calculated            using the equation: \xceE = q  P\xceV.

136,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Gases in Liquids,"The chemical structures of the solute and solvent dictate the types of forces possible            and, consequently, are important factors in determining solubility. For example, under            similar conditions, the water solubility of oxygen is approximately three times greater            than that of helium, but 100 times less than the solubility of chloromethane,                CHCl3. Considering the role of the solvents chemical structure, note            that the solubility of oxygen in the liquid hydrocarbon hexane,                C6H14, is approximately 20 times greater than it is in            water.
Other factors also affect the solubility of a given substance in a given solvent.            Temperature is one such factor, with gas solubility typically decreasing as temperature            increases, as seen in the graph below. This is one of the major impacts resulting from            the thermal pollution of natural bodies of water.
When the temperature of a river, lake, or stream is raised abnormally high, usually due            to the discharge of hot water from some industrial process, the solubility of oxygen in            the water is decreased. Decreased levels of dissolved oxygen may have serious            consequences for the health of the waters ecosystems and, in severe cases, can result            in large-scale fish kills.
The solubility of a gaseous solute is also affected by the partial pressure of solute in            the gas to which the solution is exposed. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of            the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration of this            relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively            high pressure of carbon dioxide gas and then sealing the beverage container, thus            saturating the beverage with CO2 at this pressure. When the beverage            container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is            released, and some of the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in            the form of small bubbles. At this point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon            dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration will decrease to its            equilibrium value and the beverage will become cflat.d
For many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility and partial pressure is a            proportional one and can be determined using Henry\'s law.
The quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is                    directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.
where Cg is solubility, Pg is partial pressure, and k                    is a proportionality constant that depends on the identities of the gaseous                    solute and solvent, and on the solution temperature.
At 20 C, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water exposed to gaseous oxygen at                a partial pressure of 101.3 kPa is 1.38  10 mol L. Use                Henrys law to determine the solubility of oxygen when its partial pressure is 20.7                kPa, the approximate pressure of oxygen in earths atmosphere.
According to Henrys law, for an ideal solution the solubility, Cg, of a gas (1.38  10 mol L, in                this case) is directly proportional to the pressure, Pg, of the undissolved gas above the solution (101.3 kPa in                this case). Because we know both Cg and Pg, we can rearrange this expression to solve for                    k.
Now we can use k to find the solubility at the lower pressure.
Notice that as the pressure decreased from 101.3 kPa to 20.7 kPa the concentration also decreased,                 illustrating the direct proportionality of pressure and concentration of a gas in a liquid.

137,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Collection of Gas over Water,"A simple way to collect gases that do not reactwith water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with water and invertedinto a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be madeequal to the air pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the waterlevel is the same both inside and outside the bottle, the pressure of the gas is equalto the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer.
When a reaction produces a gas that iscollected above water, the trapped gas is a mixture of the gas produced by thereaction and water vapor. If the collection flask is appropriately positioned toequalize the water levels both within and outside the flask, the pressure of thetrapped gas mixture will equal the atmospheric pressure outside the flask (seethe earlier discussion of manometers).
However, there is another factor we must considerwhen we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water evaporates and there isalways gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collectedover water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixtureequals the partial pressure of the gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. Thepressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure minus the pressure ofthe water vaporthis is referred to as the cdryd gas pressure, that is, the pressure ofthe gas only, without water vapor. The vapor pressure of water, which is the pressureexerted by water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water in a closed container, dependson the temperature; more detailed information on the temperature dependence of watervapor can be found in the table below, and vapor pressure will be discussed in moredetail later in the course.
This graph shows the vapor pressure ofwater at sea level as a function of temperature.
Video Demonstration: This video shows the collection of gas over water.
If 0.200 L of argon is collected over water ata temperature of 26 C and a pressure of 750 torr in a system like that shown indiagram above, what is the partial pressure of argon?
According to Daltons law, the total pressurein the bottle (750 torr) is the sum of the partial pressure of argon and the partialpressure of gaseous water:
P_T = P_{Ar} + P_{H_2O}
Rearranging this equation to solve for thepressure of argon gives:
P_{Ar} = P_T - P_{H_2O}
The pressure of water vapor above a sample ofliquid water at 26 C is 25.2 torr, so:
P_{Ar} = 750\\ \\mathrm{torr} - 25.2\\\\mathrm{torr} = 725\\ \\mathrm{torr}
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas and an aqueous solution of ametal anion. The reaction of hydrochloric acid and zinc is one such reaction.
The gas is collected as seen in the image below.
The reaction takes place at room temperature of 23.0 oC and an atmospheric pressure of 750.0 torr.

139,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,The Structures of Ionic Crystals,"Ionic crystals consist of two or more different            kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these ions into a            crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same            size.
Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and            their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction.            Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge            are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the            cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two            principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of            positive and negative ions in the compound.
In simple ionic structures, we usually find the            anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array.            (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions            larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when            compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy            one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of            the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane.            The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so            the hole is called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of            six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at the corners of            an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. The figure below illustrates both of            these types of holes.
Cations may occupy two types of holes                between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes.
Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and            anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or octahedral holes, as            illustrated in the figure below. Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and            larger cations occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the            octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open structure, such as a simple cubic            array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the            more open spacing.
A cations size and the shape of the                hole occupied by the compound are directly related.
There are two tetrahedral holes for each anion in            either an HCP or CCP array of anions. A compound that crystallizes in a closest-packed            array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes can have a maximum cation:anion            ratio of 2:1; all of the tetrahedral holes are filled at this ratio. Examples include            Li2O, Na2O, Li2S, and Na2S. Compounds            with a ratio of less than 2:1 may also crystallize in a closest-packed array of anions            with cations in the tetrahedral holes, if the ionic sizes fit. In these compounds,            however, some of the tetrahedral holes remain vacant.
The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either            an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1. Thus, compounds with cations in octahedral holes in a            closest-packed array of anions can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 1:1. In NiO,            MnS, NaCl, and KH, for example, all of the octahedral holes are filled. Ratios of less            than 1:1 are observed when some of the octahedral holes remain empty.
In a simple cubic array of anions, there is one            cubic hole that can be occupied by a cation for each anion in the array. In CsCl, and in            other compounds with the same structure, all of the cubic holes are occupied. Half of            the cubic holes are occupied in SrH2, UO2, SrCl2, and            CaF2.
Different types of ionic compounds often            crystallize in the same structure when the relative sizes of their ions and their            stoichiometries (the two principal features that determine structure) are similar. Many            ionic compounds crystallize with cubic unit cells, and we will use these compounds to            describe the general features of ionic structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of cations and            anions of similar size in a 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple cubic structure.            Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated below) is an example of this, with Cs+ and Cl            having radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions            forming a simple cubic unit cell, with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions            forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple cubic unit cells            formed by Cs+ ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cl ions.            Cesium ions and chloride ions touch along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One            cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry            required by the formula for cesium chloride. Note that there is no lattice point in the            center of the cell, and CsCl is not a BCC structure because a cesium ion is not            identical to a chloride ion.
Ionic compounds with similar-sized                cations and anions, such as CsCl, usually form a simple cubic structure. They                can be described by unit cells with either cations at the corners or anions at                the corners.
We have said that the location of lattice points is            arbitrary. This is illustrated by an alternate description of the CsCl structure in            which the lattice points are located in the centers of the cesium ions. In this            description, the cesium ions are located on the lattice points at the corners of the            cell, and the chloride ion is located at the center of the cell. The two unit cells are            different, but they describe identical structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio            of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically crystallizes with            an FCC unit cell, like that shown below. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this,            with Na+ and Cl having radii of 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively.            We can think of this as chloride ions forming an FCC cell, with sodium ions located in            the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell. The            sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains            four sodium ions and four chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the            formula, NaCl.
Ionic compounds with anions that are                much larger than cations, such as NaCl, usually form an FCC structure. They can                be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral                holes.
The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also            crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated below. This structure contains sulfide            ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is            identical to the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc            ion is only about 40% of the radius of a sulfide ion, so these small Zn2+            ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the            tetrahedral holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell,            giving the empirical formula ZnS.
ZnS, zinc sulfide (or zinc blende)                forms an FCC unit cell with sulfide ions at the lattice points and much smaller                zinc ions occupying half of the tetrahedral holes in the                structure.
A calcium fluoride unit cell, like that shown in            the following figure, is also an FCC unit cell, but in this case, the cations are            located on the lattice points; equivalent calcium ions are located on the lattice points            of an FCC lattice. All of the tetrahedral sites in the FCC array of calcium ions are            occupied by fluoride ions. There are four calcium ions and eight fluoride ions in a unit            cell, giving a calcium:fluorine ratio of 1:2, as required by the chemical formula,            CaF2. Close examination of the figure will reveal a simple cubic array of            fluoride ions with calcium ions in one half of the cubic holes. The structure cannot be            described in terms of a space lattice of points on the fluoride ions because the            fluoride ions do not all have identical environments. The orientation of the four            calcium ions about the fluoride ions differs.
Calcium fluoride, CaF2,                forms an FCC unit cell with calcium ions (green) at the lattice points and                fluoride ions (red) occupying all of the tetrahedral sites between                them.",,what is the relationship between anions and anions?,43.69745635986328
140,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Modern Atomic Theory,"The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms.            It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleusmassive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons composed of positively charged            protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing            negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atoms mass            because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy            almost all of an atoms volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of                10 m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10-15            mabout 100,000 times smaller.
massive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons
For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size            of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium.
Atomsand the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose themare extremely small. For            example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2  10 g. When describing the            properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure.            The atomic mass unit (amu) is the unit of mass that is used for masses of atoms,            molecules, and subatomic particles. The amu is defined with regard to the most abundant            isotope of carbon, carbon. An atom of carbon contains 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6            electrons. (Isotopes will be discussed in more detail in the next module). The mass of a            carbon atom is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. Thus, one amu is exactly 1/12 of the            mass of one carbon atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 x 10 g.
The charge of subatomic particles is also extremely small. Like the amu, an appropriately            small unit of charge has been developed to describe the charge of subatomic particles.            An electron has a charge of less than 2  C (coulomb). The fundamental            unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of            an electron (e) with e = 1.602 x 10 C.
A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier            particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is            neutral. The electron has a charge of 1 and is a much lighter particle with a mass of            about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton).            The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in table below.
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number (Z). This is the            defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For            example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic            number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must            contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons            equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number            of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called            its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass            number and the atomic number: A  Z = number of neutrons.

141,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Multiple Bonds,"The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving            single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and            triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of  and  bonds.            Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid            orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C2H4, shows us that each            carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.
The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect            the  bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of sp2 hybrid            orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p orbitals and the 2s orbital.            These orbitals form the CH single bonds and the  bond in the C=C double bond. The             bond in the C=C double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2p orbital            on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital            (lobes shown in red and blue in diagrams below) is perpendicular to the plane of the                sp2 hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a            side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis and form a  bond.
In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the            same plane. If the two planes of sp2 hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each            other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the  bond.            The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable            bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between  and  bonds; rotation            around single () bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not            depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other            words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the             bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the            axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds;            however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the  bonding orbitals,            essentially breaking the  bond.
In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom. We            find this situation in acetylene, HCCH, which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid            orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a  bond between the carbon            atoms. The remaining sp orbitals form  bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized            p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence,            form two  bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one             bond and two  bonds, giving a triple bond.

142,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Energy of Orbitals,"Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and quantum mechanics, we can use our            understanding of quantum numbers to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another.            This allows us to determine which orbitals are occupied by electrons in each atom. The            specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of the chemical            properties of that atom.
The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, n, increases. In            any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies            of subshells with different values of l differ so that the energy of the orbitals            increases within a shell in the order s < p < d < f. The diagram below, which            we saw previously, depicts how these two trends in increasing energy relate. The 1s            orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy. The            energy increases as we move up to the 2s and then 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, showing that            the increasing n value has more influence on energy than the increasing l value for            small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The 3d orbital is            higher in energy than the 4s orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we            move up the chart.
In their ground state, electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill            low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the            5p orbitals fill immediately after the 4d, and immediately before the 6s. The filling            order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical            calculations. As the principal quantum number, n, increases, the size of the orbital            increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the            attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher            (less stabilized). This order of orbitals from lowest energy to highest energy is            important, but you do not need to memorize it. We will see shortly that this order is            represented in the structure of the periodic table.

143,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions,"A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that            only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are            capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide            elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove            metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of            how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable            membranes.
Consider the apparatus illustrated in the diagram below, in which samples of pure solvent            and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate.            Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the            concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these            molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a            faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of            solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of            solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.
When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown above, the volume of the            solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the            level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of            the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent            molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a            reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent            ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (\xce) of the solution.
The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T,                    according to the equation
where R is the universal gas constant.
If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in Figure, applying pressure            greater than the osmotic pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes            solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent. This technique of reverse            osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to            produce high-purity tap water for drinking.
What is the osmotic pressure (atm) of a 0.30 M solution of glucose in water that is                used for intravenous infusion at body temperature, 37 C?
We can find the osmotic pressure, \xce, using the formula \xce = MRT, where T is on the                Kelvin scale (310 K) and the value of R is expressed in appropriate units (0.08206 L                atm/mol K).
Examples of osmosis are evident in many biological systems because cells are surrounded            by semipermeable membranes. Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have            lost water can be made crisp again by placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot            or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated salt solution loses            water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect            animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are            injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions            an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body must have            the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood            serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient            quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood            cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called            hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the            cells lose water to the more concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a            process called crenation. These effects are illustrated below.

144,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Percent Composition,"In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between the bulk mass of a            substance and the number of atoms or molecules it contains (moles). Given the chemical            formula of the substance, we were able to determine the amount of the substance (moles)            from its mass, and vice versa. But what if the chemical formula of a substance is            unknown? In this section, we will explore how to apply these very same principles in            order to derive the chemical formulas of unknown substances from experimental mass            measurements.
The elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas            are the most succinct way of representing this elemental makeup. When a compounds            formula is unknown, measuring the mass of each of its constituent elements is often the            first step in the process of determining the formula experimentally. The results of            these measurements permit the calculation of the compounds                 percent composition                                                            percentage by mass of the various elements in a compound                                                , defined as the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. For            example, consider a gaseous compound composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. The percent            composition of this compound could be represented as follows:
percentage by mass of the various elements in a compound
If analysis of a 10.0-g sample of this gas showed it to contain 2.5 g H and 7.5 g C, the            percent composition would be calculated to be 25% H and 75% C:
Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and                nitrogen showed it to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent                composition of this compound?
To calculate percent composition, we divide the experimentally derived mass of each                element by the overall mass of the compound, and then convert to a percentage:
The analysis results indicate that the compound is 61.0% C, 15.4% H, and 23.7% N by                mass.
Percent composition is also useful for evaluating the relative abundance of a                    given element in different compounds of known formulas. As one example, consider                    the common nitrogen-containing fertilizers ammonia (NH3), ammonium                    nitrate (NH4NO3), and urea (CH4N2O).                    The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the                    mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern                    for consumers choosing among these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications,                    the percent composition of a compound is easily derived from its formula mass                    and the atomic masses of its constituent elements. A molecule of NH3 contains                    one N atom weighing 14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3  1.008                    amu) = 3.024 amu. The formula mass of ammonia is therefore (14.01 amu + 3.024                    amu) = 17.03 amu, and its percent composition is:
This same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen                    molecules, or a mole of molecules, etc. The latter amount is most convenient and                    would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic and formula                    masses, as demonstrated in the example. As long as we know the chemical formula of                    the substance in question, we can easily derive percent composition from the                    formula mass or molar mass.
Aspirin is a compound with the molecular formula                            C9H8O4. What is its percent                        composition?
To calculate the percent composition, we need to know the masses of C, H, and                        O in a known mass of C9H8O4. It is                        convenient to consider 1 mol of C9H8O4 and                        use its molar mass (180.159 g/mole, determined from the chemical formula) to                        calculate the percentages of each of its elements:

145,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Polarity,"If the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in H2,            Cl2, and other diatomic molecules, then the electrons in the bond must be            shared equally. We refer to this as a pure, or nonpolar, covalent bond. Electrons shared in pure            covalent bonds have an equal probability of being near each nucleus. In the case of                Cl2, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl            shares one electron with the other, forming one covalent bond:
The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding            electrons and two shared (i.e., bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching            the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since the bonding atoms are            identical, Cl2 also features a pure covalent bond.
When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared,            but no longer equally. Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom            than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density toward that atom. This            unequal distribution of electrons is known as a polar covalent bondcovalent bond between atoms of different electronegativities; a covalent bond with a positive end and a negative end, characterized by a            partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom            that attracts the electrons more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice            versa. For example, the electrons in the HCl bond of a hydrogen chloride molecule spend            more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl molecule,            the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial            positive charge. Figure shows the distribution of electrons in the HCl bond. Note that            the shaded area around Cl is much larger than it is around H. Compare this to the                H2 nonpolar bond which shares electrons equally and there is an even            distribution of electrons between the two atoms.
covalent bond between atoms of different electronegativities; a covalent bond with a positive end and a negative end
We sometimes designate the positive and negative atoms in a polar covalent bond using a            lowercase Greek letter cdelta,d \xce, with a plus sign or minus sign to indicate whether            the atom has a partial positive charge (\xce+) or a partial negative charge (\xce). This            symbolism is shown for the HCl molecule.

146,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Module Summary and Quiz,"VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that                    minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone                    pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a                    molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only                    when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment                    measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is                    determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a                    molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond                    moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar                    molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric                    fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.

147,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Resonance,"Some molecules can have two possible structures with the atoms in the same positions and            have identical formal charges such as the nitrite ion seen below. The electrons involved            in the NO double bond, however, are in different positions:
If nitrite ions do indeed contain a single and a double bond, we would expect for the two            bond lengths to be different. A double bond between two atoms is shorter (and stronger)            than a single bond between the same two atoms. Experiments show, however, that both NO            bonds in NO2 have the same strength and length, and are identical            in all other properties.
It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for NO2 in            which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are equivalent. Instead, we use the concept            of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement of atoms can be            written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of            that shown by the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each            of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in NO2 is the average of a double            bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance formstwo or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons. The            actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is            called a resonance hybridaverage of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow            between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. Thus, the electronic            structure of the NO2 ion is shown as:
two or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons
average of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures
We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an            electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between            resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that            shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory,            used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and            resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described            it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with            both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a            resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros,            it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some            characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves            are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).
The carbonate anion, CO32, provides a second example of            resonance:
One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central            atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any            one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion.            Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual            arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures.            Again, experiments show that all three CO bonds are exactly the same.

148,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Titration,"In the 18th century, the concentration of vinegarsamples was determined by noting the amount of potassium carbonate, K2CO3 , which had to be added, a little at a time, before bubbling ceased.The greater the weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where thebubbling ended, the more concentrated the vinegar.
We now know that the effervescence that occurredduring this process was due to reaction with acetic acid, CH3CO2H, the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste ofvinegar. Acetic acid reacts with potassium carbonate according to the followingequation:
The bubbling was due to the production of CO2 gas.
The test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is onetype of quantitative analysisthe determination of the amount or concentration of asubstance in a sample. In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute(acetic acid) was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solutepresent in a known volume of the solution. In other types of chemical analyses, theamount of a substance present in a sample is determined by measuring the amount ofproduct that results.
The described approach to measuring vinegarstrength was an early version of the analytical technique known as titrationanalysisquantitative chemical analysis method that involves measuring the volume of a reactant solution required to completely react with the analyte in a sample. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buretdevice used for the precise delivery of variable liquid volumes, such as in a titration analysis to makeincremental additions of a solution containing a known concentration of somesubstance (the titrantsolution containing a known concentration of substance that will react with the analyte in a titration analysis) to a sample solution containing the substance whoseconcentration is to be measured (the analytechemical species of interest). The titrant and analyte undergo achemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrantsolution required for complete reaction with the analyte (the equivalence pointvolume of titrant solution required to react completely with the analyte in a titration analysis; provides a stoichiometric amount of titrant for the samples analyte according to the titration reactionof the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration.

The equivalence point of a titration may bedetected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solutionaccompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in theclassic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, specialdyes called indicatorssubstances added to the sample in a titration analysis to permit visual detection of the end point are added to the sample solutions to impart a change incolor at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence pointsmay also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in apredictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approachtaken to detect a titrations equivalence point, the volume of titrant actuallymeasured is called the end point. Properly designed titration methods typicallyensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible.Though any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titrationanalysis, the three described in this unit (precipitation, acid-base, and redox)are most common.

149,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The van der Waals Equation,"The ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas            molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable            part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure            and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and            deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregardedthis is,            however, is not always the case.
In 1879, the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals developed an equation which corrects            for the attraction between gas particles and their volume. Under certain conditions of            high pressure and low temperatures the deviations from ideal gas law are significant and            the van der Waals equation should be used to accurately determine characteristics of a            sample of gas.
The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one                to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces                between them.
The constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a            particular gas, and the constant b corresponds to the volume of the molecules of a            particular gas. The ccorrectiond to the pressure term in the ideal gas law is                (n2a)/v2, and the ccorrectiond to the volume is nb. Note that            when V is relatively large and n is relatively small, both of these correction terms            become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV =            nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules            is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure.            Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some common gases are given in            table below.
At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than            the one for molecular volume, b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for            the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are            incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some            intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears            to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This            behavior is reflected by the cdipsd in the graph seen below that we looked at earlier.            The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an            ideal gas, as pressure is raised. At very high pressures, the gas becomes less            compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly            significant fraction of the total gas volume.
Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions            between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an            appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of            low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave            ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be            disregardedthis is, however, very often not the case.
A 4.25-L flask contains 3.46 mol CO2 at 229 C. Calculate the pressure of                this sample of CO2:

P = \\frac{3.46 \\mathrm{mol} \imes 0.08206 \\mathrm{L\\ atm\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}} \imes 502 \\mathrm{K}}{                (4.25 \\mathrm{L} - 3.46 \\mathrm{mol} \imes 0.0427 \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}})} -                 \\frac{(3.46 \\mathrm{mol})^2 \imes 3.59 \\mathrm{L^2\\ atm\\ mol^2}}{(4.25 \\mathrm{L})^2}
P = 32.4 \\mathrm{atm}
(c) Explain the reason(s) for the difference.
This is not very different from the value from the ideal gas law because the                pressure is not very high and the temperature is not very low. The value is somewhat                different because CO2 molecules do have some volume and attractions                between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or                attractions.

150,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Volume and Pressure,"If we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a                    specific amount of air at constant temperature, say 25 C. If we slowly push in                    the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is                    compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the                    plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the                    effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in                    general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure,                    and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume                    increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and                    vice versa.

Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed below.
Unlike the PT and VT relationships, pressure and volume are not directly                    proportional to each other. Instead, P and V exhibit inverse proportionality.
The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at                    constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher                    Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now known as                    Boyles lawvolume of a given number of moles of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured: The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is                    inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured.
volume of a given number of moles of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured
Boyle\'s law states that the volume of a given amount of gas held at                            constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under                            which it is measured. Mathematically this can be represented as:
Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when                    plotting the inverse of the pressure (1/P) versus the volume (V), or the inverse                    of volume (1/V) versus the pressure (P). Graphs with curved lines are                    difficult to read accurately at low or high values of the variables, and they                    are more difficult to use in fitting theoretical equations and parameters to                    experimental data. For those reasons, scientists often try to find a way to                    clinearized their data. If we plot P versus V, we obtain a hyperbola as seen                    below.
The sample of gas has a volume of 15.0 mL at a pressure of 0.884 atm.                        Determine the pressure of the gas at a volume of 7.5 mL.
Because we are looking for the pressure change caused by a volume change at                        constant temperature, we will use Boyle\'s law equation.
Identify the variables in the problem.

151,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Paramagnetism,"For almost every covalent molecule that exists, we can now draw the Lewis structure,            predict the electron-pair geometry, predict the molecular geometry, and come close to            predicting bond angles. However, one of the most important molecules we know, the oxygen            molecule O2, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We would            write the following Lewis structure for O2:
This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an            O=O double bond, and each oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this            picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen. By itself, O2 is not            magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past            a strong magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as seen            in the image below. Such attraction to a magnetic field is called paramagnetism, and it            arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure of O2            indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?
Magnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic            field. When we compare the weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field            (seen in the diagram below), paramagnetic samples that are attracted to the magnet will            appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the            number of unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.
Experiments show that each O2 molecule has two unpaired electrons. The            Lewis-structure model does not predict the presence of these two unpaired electrons.            Unlike oxygen, the apparent weight of most molecules decreases slightly in the presence            of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Materials in which all of the electrons are paired            are diamagnetic and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic            materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in the presence of an applied magnetic            field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion.
Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that            accounts for the paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a            number of other molecules, such as violations of the octet rule and more molecules with            more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are difficult to describe            with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of            electrons in a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence            bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that are assigned to one specific atom, MO            theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that are            delocalized over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent            atoms. MO theory also helps us understand why some substances are electrical conductors,            others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators. The table below summarizes            the main points of the two complementary bonding theories. Both theories provide            different, useful ways of describing molecular structure.

152,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Theory,"Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the            same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals.            Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by            a wave function, \xce, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around            isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized)            energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be            found is called a molecular orbital (\xce). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular            orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.
We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms                (H2 or Cl2, for example). Such molecules are called            homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular            orbitals occur.
The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is            called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the            wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic            orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which            peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with            troughs, as seen below. In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine            with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and            out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.
There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s            orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated below. The in-phase            combination produces a lower energy s molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s"") in which            most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition            (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher            energy s molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s-star"") molecular orbital in which there            is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding            orbital. Electrons in a s orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are            more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons            to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these            orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the s orbitals are located well away from the            region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these            electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding            orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy            antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill            higher-energy atomic orbitals.
In p orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous            to how a two-dimensional wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate            the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same            phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When            regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron            density and creates nodes. When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create  and *            orbitals. If two atoms are located along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system,            the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form px (bonding) and px (antibonding)            (read as ""sigma-p-x"" and ""sigma-p-x star,"" respectively). Just as with s-orbital            overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a            higher-energy, antibonding orbital.
The side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi () bonding molecular            orbital and a * antibonding molecular orbital, as shown below. In valence bond theory,            we describe  bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and            perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either side of            the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the  orbital by this same shape, and            a  bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact            with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For            the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the            internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.
In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of p            orbitals oriented side by side (py and pz), so these four atomic            orbitals combine pairwise to create two  orbitals and two * orbitals. The py and                py orbitals are oriented at right angles to the pz and pz            orbitals. Except for their orientation, the py and pz orbitals            are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals. The                py and pz antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and            identical except for their orientation. A total of six molecular orbitals results from            the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms: px and                px, py and py, pz and                pz.
Predict what type (if any) of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave                functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap. The orbitals are all similar in                energy.
(a) is an in-phase combination, resulting in a p orbital
(b) will not result in a new orbital because the in-phase component (bottom) and                out-of-phase component (top) cancel out. Only orbitals with the correct alignment                can combine.
(c) is an out-of-phase combination, resulting in a p orbital.

153,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams,"The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a            molecular orbital diagram, as seen below. For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of            one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each            horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular            orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center.            Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals.            For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular            orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that            combining the six 2p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one  and two )            and three antibonding orbitals (one * and two *).
We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the            orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle.            Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before            pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins            as seen in the diagram below. Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the            molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating            the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular            orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so            parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion            containing seven electrons (such as Be2+) would have the molecular electron            configuration (s)2(s)2(s)2(s)1. It is common to omit the core electrons from            molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence            electrons.
The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both                    bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The net contribution of the                    electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the                    bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by                    electrons.
When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in                    molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons                    between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a                    bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order                    differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of                    electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is                    more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but                    both methods describe the same phenomenon.
In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction                    if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding                    interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated                    by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing                    (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to                    get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:
The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given                    atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases, as seen in the table below. If the                    distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such                    that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not                    form. We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.

154,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Bonding in Diatomic Molecules,"A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the                    atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular                    orbital of lowest energy, the s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,                        H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule                    is lower than that of two H atoms. The s orbital that contains both                    electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.
A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the                        H2 molecule are in the s bonding orbital; the electron                    configuration is (s)2. We represent this configuration                    by a molecular orbital energy diagram seen below in which a single upward arrow                    indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows                    indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons                    so we have
Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single                    bond.
A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium                    atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule, He2, with four                    electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the                    lower-energy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the                    two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital. We would write                    the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as                        (s)2(s)2 as seen in the                    diagram below The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force                    for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as                    discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a                    hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero.
A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.
Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the                    second period of the periodic table: Li2, Be2,                        B2, C2, N2, O2, F2,                    and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the                        Ne2 molecule would not be stable. We can see this by a                    consideration of the molecular electron configurations in the table below.
We predict ground state valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict                    electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence                    molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hunds                    rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons                    fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes                    place.
As we saw in valence bond theory,  bonds are generally more stable than  bonds                    formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory,                     orbitals are usually more stable than  orbitals. However, this is not always                    the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in                    below. Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is                    consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for                    atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe                    a different pattern, in which the p orbital is higher in energy than                    the p set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear                    diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral                    molecule.
This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing.                    s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of                    the existing molecular orbitals. The s wavefunction mathematically combines                    with the p wavefunction, with the result that the s orbital becomes                    more stable, and the p orbital becomes less stable, as seen int the                    energy diagram below. Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p                    mixing, with the \\(\\sigma_s^\\ast\\) becoming more stable and the \\(\\sigma_p^\\ast\\)                    becoming less stable.
s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. The energy                    difference between 2s and 2p orbitals in O, F, and Ne is greater than that in                    Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and                        Ne2 exhibit negligible s-p mixing (not sufficient to change the                    energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown                    above. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which                    leads to the pattern where the p orbital is raised above the                        p set.
Using the MO diagrams shown, we can add in the electrons and determine the                    molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic                    molecules. As shown in the table above, Be2 and Ne2                    molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.
The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li2,                    is analogous to the formation of H2, but the atomic orbitals involved                    are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence                    electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the s                    bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding                    orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule                    is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at                    temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules                    in the table above with a bond order greater than zero are also known.
The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the                        (py,pz) level. We expect the two electrons that                    occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular                    electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the fact that the                    oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons, as seen in the energy diagram in the                    example below. The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult                    to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it                    quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a                    strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.
Draw the molecular orbital diagram for the oxygen molecule, O2.                        From this diagram, calculate the bond order for O2. How does this                        diagram account for the paramagnetism of O2?
We draw a molecular orbital energy diagram. Each oxygen atom contributes six                        electrons, so the diagram appears as shown below.
We calculate the bond order as
Oxygen\'s paramagnetism is explained by the presence of two unpaired electrons                        in the (py, pz)* molecular orbitals.
Give the molecular orbital configuration for the valence electrons in                            C22. Will this ion be stable?
Looking at the appropriate MO diagram, we see that the  orbitals are lower                        in energy than the p orbital. The valence electron configuration                        for C2 is                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4.                        Adding two more electrons to generate the C22 anion will give a                        valence electron configuration of                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4(px)2.                        Since this has six more bonding electrons than antibonding, the bond order                        will be 3, and the ion should be stable.

155,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two                    separate atomic orbitals on different atoms that creates a region with one pair                    of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along an                    axis containing the nuclei, they form a  bond. When they overlap in a fashion                    that creates a node along this axis, they form a  bond.
We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of                    the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently                    bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma () bonds directed toward                    other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine                    the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions                    of electron density about it. Two such regions imply sp hybridization; three,                        sp2 hybridization; four, sp3 hybridization; five, sp3d                    hybridization; and six, sp3d2 hybridization. Pi () bonds                    are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals).
Multiple bonds consist of a  bond located along the axis between two atoms and                    one or two  bonds. The  bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized                    atomic orbitals, while the  bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of                    unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized                    orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of  bonds                    can vary.

156,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles                    called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of                    atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms                    of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form                    compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental                    proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of                    one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small,                    whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor                    destroyed.
Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have                    demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomsons cathode ray tube showed that                    atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan                    discovered that there is a fundamental electric chargethe charge of an                    electron. Rutherfords gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small,                    dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the                    nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains                    neutral particles called neutrons.
An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons.                    The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times                    smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in                    atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is                    defined as exactly 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 ×                        10 g.
Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073                    amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087                    amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1 and a mass of 0.00055                    amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is                    the property that defines an atoms elemental identity. The sum of the numbers                    of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed                    in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when                    it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.

157,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Bohr Model of the Atom Calculations,"Bohr postulated that the energy absorbed or emitted when an electron transitioned fromone orbital to another would reflect differences in the orbital energies according tothis equation:
\\mid\\Delta E\\mid=\\mid E_f\\;-\\;E_i\\mid
Where E i is the energy of the electron in its initial orbital and Ef is the energy of the electron in its final orbital. Knowing that theenergies of the orbitals can be calculated with the equation:
E\\;=\\;k\\left(\{n^2}\ight)
These equations can be combined to calculate the change in energy as an electrontransitions from one orbital to another.
iangle E\\;=\\;k\\;\\left(\{n_f^2}\\;-\\;\{n_i^2}\ight)
The wavelength and frequency of the energy absorbed or emitted during thistransition can also be calculated using the equation:

Calculate the change in energy from the transition of an electron from n = 3 to n = 2.What is the wavelength of this emission?
Using the following equation, we can calculate the energy of the transition:

Note that the negative value of \xceE indicates an emission of energy.
Using the following equation we can calculate the wavelength of the energyemitted:

Notice that this falls within the wavelength range corresponding to red light. It is this transition fromn = 3 to n = 2 that produces the red line on the line spectra of hydrogen.
With the puzzling paradoxes of the photoelectric effect and the hydrogen atom now solvedand all involving Plancks constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to mostphysicists at that time that the classical theories that worked so well in themacroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not be extended down into themicroscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohrs remarkableachievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unableto extend his theory to the next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohrsmodel was severely flawed, since it was still based on the classical mechanics notion ofprecise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopicdomain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classicalmechanics.

158,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Module Summary and Quiz,"Matter has thermal energy due to the KE of its molecules and temperature that corresponds            to the average KE of its molecules. Heat is energy that is transferred between objects            at different temperatures; it flows from a high to a low temperature. Chemical and            physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI            unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).
Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the            temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a            substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature            change it undergoes.
Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or            physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that            occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured            quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the            process using known mathematical relations.
Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between the system being studied            and its surroundings. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by            introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the            energy content of food.

160,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Single-step Conversions,"Sometimes it is necessary to convert a measurement from one unit to another. For            instance, if a measurement is given in miles it may be convenient or necessary to            convert it to km or m. Dimensional analysisMethod used to convert from one unit of measure to another. (or factor-label method) is a method used to            convert from one unit of measure to another. Dimensional analysis is based on this            premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations            as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from            simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several            different quantities.
Method used to convert from one unit of measure to another.
A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be            used as a unit conversion factorratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are            equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the            ratio,
ratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit
Several other commonly used equalities are given in table below.
*Note in the table above, that the English units ounces (oz) and fluid ounces (fl oz) are            often both referred to as ounces in everyday use. However, they are distinctly different            as oz is a unit of mass and fl oz is a unit of volume.
When we multiply a quantity (such as distance given in inches) by an appropriate unit            conversion factor, we convert the quantity to an equivalent value with different units            (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball players vertical jump of            34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:
When we multiply by the unit factor                \\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.} we do not change            the value of the measurement because 2.54 cm is equivalent to 1 in.
The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit                conversion factor derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g.
We can form two conversion factors from the relationship between ounces and                grams.
To determine which conversion factor to use to make the conversion, we need to look                carefully at the units. Since we are converting from g to oz, we want the unit of g                to cancel out. The unit factor that causes the unit of g to cancel is:
Notice that the unit of g cancels, leaving the unit of ounces. Also, notice that the                final answer has 3 significant figures because the original measurement has 3                significant figures. In this context, the 1 in 1 oz is an exact number and has an                infinite number of significant figures.

161,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Electronegativity,"Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding            atoms called electronegativitytendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond to itself. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an            atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the            shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an            atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in            a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more            electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the            difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the            larger the partial charges of the atoms.
tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond to itself
The periodic table shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one            of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling. In general,            electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and            decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have            the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all            (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have            the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure            because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a            full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO2 do exist, they can only be            formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model            of electronegativity.)
We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The                    electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the                    energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an                    electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes                    how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity                    that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity                    values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of                    bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4.
The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (\xceEN) of two bonded                    atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and,                    thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is                    covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic.                    The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in                    the bonds HH, HCl, and NaCl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1                    (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms                    varies from completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic                    bonding). The diagrams below show the relationship between electronegativity                    difference and bond type.
A rough approximation of the electronegativity differences associated with                    covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds is shown in Figure. This table is just                    a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example, the H and F atoms                    in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3                    a difference of 0.9, yet both of these compounds form bonds that are considered                    polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl atoms in NaCl have an electronegativity                    difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI2 have a difference                    of 1.0, yet both of these substances form ionic compounds.
The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the                    types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table.                    Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and                    a nonmetal is often ionic.
Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds. The atoms in polyatomic                    ions, such as OH, NO3, and                    NH4+, are held together by polar covalent bonds.                    However, these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of                    opposite charge. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO3, contains the                    K+ cation and the polyatomic NO3 anion.                    Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic                    attraction between the ions K+ and NO3, as                    well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in                    NO3.
Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of                        proteins. Using the electronegativity values in Figure, arrange the                        following covalent bondsall commonly found in amino acidsin order of                        increasing polarity. Then designate the positive and negative atoms using                        the symbols \xce+ and \xce:
The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the                    electronegativity difference increases. The atom with the \xce designation is the                    more electronegative of the two. Table shows these bonds in order of increasing                    polarity.

162,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Electron Configurations,"The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configurationelectronic structure of an atom in its ground state given as a listing ofthe orbitals occupied by the electrons of the atom. We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that containsthree pieces of information:

For example, the notation 2p4 (read ""twopfour"") indicates four electrons ina p subshelldumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describesorbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a pelectron (l = 1) with a principal quantum number (n) of 2. The notation 3d8(read ""threedeight"") indicates eight electrons in the d subshell (i.e., l = 2) of theprincipal shell for which n = 3.

To determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can cbuilddthe structures in the order of atomic numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, andcontinuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a timeto the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have describedthe electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principleprocedure in which the electron configuration of the elements isdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, addingone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the propersubshell at a time, from the German word Aufbau (cto build upd). Each added electronoccupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in thediagram below), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantumnumbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enterhigher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled tocapacity.
procedure in which the electron configuration of the elements isdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, addingone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the propersubshell at a time
Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electronconfigurations, the figure below provides an alternative method for determiningthe electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen andincludes each subshell as you proceed in increasing Z order. For example, afterfilling the 3p block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followedby the 3d orbitals.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the electron configurationof an element from the periodic table.
The alkali metal sodium (atomic number 11) has one more electron than the neonatom. This electron must go into the lowest-energy subshell available, the 3sorbital, giving a 1s22s22p63s1configuration. The electrons occupying the inner shell orbitals are called core electronselectron in an atom that occupies the orbitals of the innershells. Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electronconfigurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noblegas that matches the core electron configuration, and then writing the rest ofthe electron configuration that represents the outer-shell electrons. Theouter-shell electrons are very significant in that they contain the valence electronselectrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts of the atom. The valence electrons are those electrons in the outermostshell orbitals of the atom. It is these electrons that heavily contribute to anelement\'s properties and they are the electrons involved in chemical bonding.Valance electrons will be discussed in more detail later in this course. For oursodium example, the symbol [Ne] represents core electrons,(1s22s22p6) and our abbreviated orcondensed configuration is [Ne]3s1.

electrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts
Similarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as[He]2s1, where [He] represents the configuration of the heliumatom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writingthe configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurationsof lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which are in the alkali metal family, haveonly one electron in a valence s subshell outside a filled set of innershells.
Li: [He]2s1
Na: [Ne]3s1
The alkaline earth metal magnesium (atomic number 12), with its 12 electrons in a[Ne]3s2 configuration, is analogous to its family memberberyllium, [He]2s2. Both atoms have a filled s subshell outside theirfilled inner shells. Aluminum (atomic number 13), with 13 electrons and theelectron configuration [Ne]3s23p1, is analogous to itsfamily member boron, [He]2s22p1.
The electron configurations of silicon (14 electrons), phosphorus (15 electrons),sulfur (16 electrons), chlorine (17 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) areanalogous in the electron configurations of their outer shells to theircorresponding family members carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon,respectively, except that the principal quantum number of the outer shell of theheavier elements has increased by one to n = 3. Figure shows the lowest energy,or ground-state, electron configuration for these elements as well as that foratoms of each of the known elements.
When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metalpotassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to addelectrons to the 3d subshell. However, all available chemical and physicalevidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the nextelectron is not added to the 3d level but is, instead, added to the 4s level.The 3d orbital with no radial nodes and is higher in energy because it is lesspenetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s, which has threeradial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of[Ar]4s1. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valenceshell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s subshell andcalcium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s2. This gives calciuman outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium andmagnesium.
Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additionalelectrons are added successively to the 3d subshell. This subshell is filled toits capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for l = 2 [d orbitals], there arel + 1 = 5 values of ml, meaning that there are five d orbitals thathave a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4p subshell fills next. Note thatfor three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y)through silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 delectrons are successively added to the (n  1) shell next to the n shell tobring that (n  1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La)through lutetium (Lu) and actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr), 14 f electrons(l = 3, 2l + 1 = 7 mlvalues; thus, seven orbitals with a combinedcapacity of 14 electrons) are successively added to the (n  2) shell to bringthat shell from 18 electrons to a total of 32 electrons.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the abbreviated electronconfiguration from the periodic table.
Thus far, we have looked at electron configurations for ground state atoms.Electron configurations for excited atoms can also be represented. If theelectron configuration represents an excited atom, it will not follow thesequence we have looked at for ground state atoms.

163,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Determination of Empirical Formulas,"As previously mentioned, the most common approachto determining a compounds chemical formula is to first measure the masses of itsconstituent elements. However, we must keep in mind that chemical formulas represent therelative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentallyderived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms inthe compound. To accomplish this, we can use molar masses to convert the mass of eachelement to a number of moles. We then consider the moles of each element relative toeach other, converting these numbers into a whole-number ratio that can be used toderive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determinedto contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H. The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles)are:
Thus, we can accurately represent this compoundwith the formula C 0.142 H 0.248 . Of course, per acceptedconvention, formulas contain whole-number subscripts, which can be achieved by dividingeach mol amount by the smaller of the two.
This gives us the whole number ratio of C:Hatoms in the compound as 1:2 or CH2
The empirical formula for this compound is thus CH2. This may or not be the compounds molecular formula as well; however,we would need additional information to make that determination (as discussed later inthis section).
The process for determining the formula for anempirical formula are summarized in the steps below.
Convert the given amount of eachelement into moles.
Divide each mole amount by thesmallest of the mole values.
If step 2 does not produce wholenumbers (or very close to it), find a multiple of all of the values thatproduces all whole numbers.
Write the chemical formula basedon the whole number ratio of atoms in the compound.
Consider as another example a sample ofcompound determined to contain 5.31 g Cl and 8.40 g O. What isthe empirical formula for this compound?
Convert to moles.
Divide each mole value by the smallest of thevalues.
Notice this step of the process inthis example did not yield a whole number ratio.
Find a multiple of the values that yields awhole number ratio.
Multiplying both mole values by 2 yields thewhole number ratio 2:7.
Write the chemical formula.
Finally, with regard to deriving empiricalformulas, consider instances in which a compounds percent composition isavailable rather than the absolute masses of the compounds constituentelements. In such cases, the percent composition can be used to calculate themasses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these masses canthen be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.
The bacterial fermentation of grain to produceethanol forms a gas with a percent composition of 27.29% C and 72.71% O. What is theempirical formula for this gas?
Since the scale for percentages is 100, it ismost convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100g. The calculation is cmost convenientd because, per the definition for percentcomposition, the mass of a given element in grams is numerically equivalent to theelements mass percentage. This numerical equivalence results from the definition ofthe cpercentaged unit, whose name is derived from the Latin phrase per centummeaning cby the hundred.d Considering this definition, the mass percentages providedmay be more conveniently expressed as fractions:
The molar amounts of carbon and hydrogen in ag sample are calculated by dividing each elements mass by its molar mass:
Coefficients for the tentative empiricalformula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of the two:
Since the resulting ratio is one carbon to twooxygen atoms, the empirical formula is:

164,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Module Summary and Quiz,"If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused                    by expansion or contraction, q for the change is called the enthalpy change with the                    symbol \xceH, or \xceH for reactions occurring under standard state                    conditions. The value of \xceH for a reaction in one direction is                    equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to \xceH for the reaction                    in the opposite direction, and \xceH is directly proportional to                    the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation,\xceHf is the enthalpy change accompanying                    the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at                    1 bar (standard state). If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise                    processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy                    changes of the various steps. A particularly useful form of Hesss laws is predicting                    the enthalpy of a reaction from the enthalpies of formation of the reactants and                    products.

165,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Exceptions to the Octet Rule,"While most central atoms of molecules and polyatomic ions have eight electrons, some have            central atoms that do not have an octet of electrons in their Lewis structures. These            molecules fall into three categories:
First we will consider hypervalent molecules. These are the most common of the exceptions            and will be important to understand for our discussion in the next module.
Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n =                    2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because                    they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three                        2p orbitals).
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 2nd period, C, N, O, and F do NOT exceed                    an octet.
Elements in the third and higher periods (n  3) have                    their valence electrons in the 3rd period or higher. These shells include a d                    subshell and allow atoms in the 3rd period or higher to accommodate more than an                    octet of electrons.
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 3rd period or higher, while they usually                    form an octet, can exceed an octet of electrons. Molecules formed from these                    elements are called hypervalent molecules. The Lewis structures below show two                    hypervalent molecules, SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, which is used as an                    insulating gas in the electrical industry, but is a potent greenhouse gas.
In some hypervalent molecules, such as XeF4, xenon tetrafluoride which                     was the first binary compound of a noble gas, some of the electrons in                    the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs:
When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have                    electrons left over after filling the valence shells of the outer atoms with                    eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central                    atom.
Determine the Lewis structure for phosphorus pentachloride,                        PCl5, which is an important chlorinating agent in organic and inorganic synthesis. .
As before, we need to calculate the number of valence electrons that will be                        represented in the Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central P atom to the terminal Cl atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The Lewis structure now shows all 40 valence electrons in the molecule and is                        therefore complete.
Determine the Lewis structure for iodine pentafluoride, IF5, a fluorinating agent.
Calculate the number of valence electrons that will be represented in the                        Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central I atom to the terminal F atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The structure with the octets of the terminal atoms complete shows 40                        electrons. There are still 2 electrons to incorporate into the structure.                        These additional electrons are added to the central atom.
Now the structure shows all 42 electrons. Note that no additional electrons                        can be added to the F atoms because F is in the 2nd period and cannot exceed                        an octet of electrons.
We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not                    have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms                    from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not                    form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium                    dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium                    and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is                    possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a                    fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental                    evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for BF single                    bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three BF single bonds and an                    electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with                    an electron deficient boron. However, the BF bonds are slightly shorter than                    what is actually expected for BF single bonds, indicating that some double bond                    character is found in the actual molecule.
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight                    electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with                        BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the                    boron atom:
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals.                            Nitric oxide, NO a biological signaling molecule, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is                            produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react                            at high temperatures. Odd electron molecules are very rare and cannot                            achieve full octets of electrons around atoms because of the odd number                            of electrons. The two possible Lewis structures for NO are seen                            below. Based on formal charge, the left structure is more plausible than the right structure.

166,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Hydrogen Bonding,"Nitrosyl fluoride (ONF, molecular mass 49 amu) is a gas at room temperature. Water                (H2O, molecular mass 18 amu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower            molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between the two compounds to            dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and            larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion            forces. Additionally, we cannot attribute this difference in boiling points to            differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are polar and exhibit            comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a            particularly strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a            hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most            electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity between the H            atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or            3.0 for a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively            small sizes of F, O, or N atoms, leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these            atoms. Molecules with F-H, O-H, or N-H moieties are very strongly attracted to similar            moieties in nearby molecules, a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole attraction            called hydrogen bonding. Examples of hydrogen bonds include HFb\xafHF, H2Ob\xafHOH,            and H3Nb, in which the hydrogen bonds are denoted by dots.            The video below illustrates hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
Despite use of the word cbond,d keep in mind that hydrogen bonds are intermolecular            attractive forces, not intramolecular attractive forces (covalent bonds). Hydrogen bonds            are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about 5 to 10% as strong, but are generally            much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.
Hydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids            and solids). For example, consider the trends in boiling points for the binary hydrides            of group 15 (NH3, PH3, AsH3, and SbH3),            group 16 hydrides (H2O, H2S, H2Se, and            H2Te), and group 17 hydrides (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI), as discussed in the            slide show below.
Consider the compounds dimethylether (CH3OCH3), ethanol                    (CH3CH2OH), and propane                    (CH3CH2CH3). Their boiling points, not                necessarily in order, are .1 C, .8 C, and 78.4 C. Match each compound with                its boiling point. Explain your reasoning.
The VSEPR-predicted shapes of CH3OCH3,                    CH3CH2OH, and CH3CH2CH3                are similar, as are their molar masses (46 g/mol, 46 g/mol, and 44 g/mol,                respectively), so they will exhibit similar dispersion forces. Since CH3CH2CH3 is                nonpolar, it may exhibit only dispersion forces. Because                    CH3OCH3 is polar, it will also experience dipole-dipole                attractions. Finally, CH3CH2OH has an OH group, and so it                will experience the uniquely strong dipole-dipole attraction known as hydrogen                bonding. So the ordering in terms of strength of IMFs, and thus boiling points, is                    CH3CH2CH3 < CH3OCH3                < CH3CH2OH. The boiling point of propane is .1 C, the                boiling point of dimethylether is .8 C, and the boiling point of ethanol is 78.5                C.

167,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ion Formation,"In ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the            element) remains unchanged. Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from            other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer            and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the            formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged            particles called ions.

When atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give            them the same number of electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic            table.

Note the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge.            Moving from the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to            form cations with a charge equal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form 1+            ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on            the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the            number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one            group left of the noble gases) form 1 ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2            ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive            value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition            metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by            their location in the table. For example, copper can form ions with a 1+ or 2+ charge,            and iron can form ions with a 2+ or 3+ charge.
In many situations an atom will gain or lose electrons so that it has the same number of            electrons as the noble gas to which it is nearest. As we saw in the examples, magnesium            lost 2 electrons to obtain the same number of electrons as neon and fluorine gained 1            electron so that it had the same number of electrons as neon.

168,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"The kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very effective model that                    effectively explains ideal gas behavior. The theory assumes that gases consist                    of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion,                    colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with                    average velocities determined by their absolute temperatures. The individual                    molecules of a gas exhibit a range of velocities, the distribution of these                    velocities being dependent on the temperature of the gas and the mass of its                    molecules.
Gaseous atoms and molecules move freely and randomly through space. Diffusion is                    the process whereby gaseous atoms and molecules are transferred from regions of                    relatively high concentration to regions of relatively low concentration.                    Effusion is a similar process in which gaseous species pass from a container to                    a vacuum through very small orifices. The rates of effusion of gases are                    inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities or to the square                    roots of their atoms/molecules masses (Grahams law).
Gas molecules possess a finite volume and experience forces of attraction for one                    another. Consequently, gas behavior is not necessarily described well by the                    ideal gas law. Under conditions of low pressure and high temperature, these                    factors are negligible, the ideal gas equation is an accurate description of gas                    behavior, and the gas is said to exhibit ideal behavior. However, at lower                    temperatures and higher pressures, corrections for molecular volume and                    molecular attractions are required to account for finite molecular size and                    attractive forces. The van der Waals equation is a modified version of the ideal                    gas law that can be used to account for the non-ideal behavior of gases under                    these conditions.

169,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Liquids in Liquids,"We know that some liquids mix with each other in all proportions; in other words, they            have infinite mutual solubility and are said to be miscible. Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and            ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze) are examples of liquids that are            completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline.
Liquids that mix with water in all proportions are usually polar substances or substances            that form hydrogen bonds. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen            bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as            those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds            of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because            there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent,            and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in            polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration            of the chemical axiom clike dissolves like.d
Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible.                    Layers are formed when we pour immiscible liquids into the same container.                    Gasoline, oil, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other                    nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. The attraction between the molecules                    of such nonpolar liquids and polar water molecules is ineffectively weak. The                    only strong attractions in such a mixture are between the water molecules, so                    they effectively squeeze out the molecules of the nonpolar liquid. The                    distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of degrees, so                    that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to                    be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility.
Two liquids, such as bromine and water, that are of moderate mutual solubility are said            to be partially miscible. Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when            mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated            with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is            nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly            discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water            in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine            layer.

170,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Moles of Gas and Volume,"The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to accountfor the behavior of gases, stating that equal volumes of all gases, measuredunder the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same numberof molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimentalobservations.
Avogadros lawvolume of a gas at constant temperature and pressure is proportional to the number of gas molecules states: for a confined gas, the volume (V) and number ofmoles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure and temperature bothremain constant.
volume of a gas at constant temperature and pressure is proportional to the number of gas molecules

171,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Oxidation-Reduction: Oxidation States,"Earths atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O2, a chemically            reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in            many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidationprocess in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons             was originally            used to describe chemical reactions involving O2, but its meaning has evolved            to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox)            reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of            this classification.
process in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield            ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium            chloride:
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to            represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a            half-reaction:
These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl2            molecule) gain electrons, the csd subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are            present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the            loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:
In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes reductionprocess in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons        . Viewed from            a more active perspective, sodium functions as a reducing agent(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized (reductant), since it            provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an            oxidizing agent(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes)            sodium.
process in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons
(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized
(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for            example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the            explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the            previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called            oxidation number has been defined. The oxidation numberthe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic (or oxidation statethe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic) of an            element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic.            The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a            molecule or ion.
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals                    the charge on the molecule or ion.
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first,                    followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the                    reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to                    emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.
Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all                the elements in the following species:
a) H2S
b) SO32
c) SO42-
The oxidation number for H is +1.
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the                charge on the molecule or ion.
Since the oxidation state of H is +1 and there are 2 hydrogen atoms in this compound,                in order to obtain an overall charge of zero, we assign  for the oxidation state                of the sulfur.
The oxidation number for each oxygen in this situation, as it is in most, is .
The overall charge of the monatomic ion is .

172,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Units of Solution Concentration: Parts per Million and Parts per Billion,"Very low solute concentrations are often expressed using appropriately small units such            as parts per million (ppm)ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 106 or parts per billion (ppb)ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 109. Like percentage (cpart per            hundredd) units, ppm and ppb may be defined in terms of masses, volumes, or mixed            mass-volume units. There are also ppm and ppb units defined with respect to numbers of            atoms and molecules.
ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 106
ratio of solute-to-solution mass multiplied by 109
The mass-based definitions of ppm and ppb are given here:
Both ppm and ppb are convenient units for reporting the concentrations of pollutants and            other trace contaminants in water. Concentrations of these contaminants are typically            very low in treated and natural waters, and their levels cannot exceed relatively low            concentration thresholds without causing adverse effects on health and wildlife. For            example, the EPA has identified the maximum safe level of fluoride ion in tap water to            be 4 ppm. Inline water filters are designed to reduce the concentration of fluoride and            several other trace-level contaminants in tap water.
According to the EPA, when the concentration of lead in tap water reaches 15 ppb,                certain remedial actions must be taken. What is this concentration in ppm? At this                concentration, what mass of lead (\xce\xbcg) would be contained in a typical glass of water                (300 mL)?
The definitions of the ppm and ppb units may be used to convert the given                concentration from ppb to ppm. Comparing these two unit definitions shows that ppm                is 1000 times greater than ppb (1 ppm = 103 ppb). Thus:
The definition of the ppb unit may be used to calculate the requested mass if the                mass of the solution is provided. However, only the volume of solution (300 mL) is                given, so we must use the density to derive the corresponding mass. We can assume                the density of tap water to be roughly the same as that of pure water (~1.00 g/mL),                since the concentrations of any dissolved substances should not be very large.                Rearranging the equation defining the ppb unit and substituting the given quantities                yields:
Finally, convert this mass to the requested unit of micrograms:

173,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Module Summary and Quiz,"Electron configurations allow us to understand many periodic trends. Covalent                    radius increases as we move down a group because the n level (orbital size)                    increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across a                    period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons                    increases, and the electrons are pulled in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii                    are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the                    number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained                    constant. Ionization energy (the energy associated with forming a cation)                    decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it is easier                    to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity                    (the energy associated with forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic)                    when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the nucleus.                    Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to                    right across the periodic table and decreases as we move down a group. For both                    IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends when dealing                    with completely filled or half-filled subshells.

174,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Module Summary and Quiz,"Phase transitions are processes that convert matter from one physical state into another.            There are six phase transitions between the three phases of matter. Melting,            vaporization, and sublimation are all endothermic processes, requiring an input of heat            to overcome intermolecular attractions. The reciprocal transitions of freezing,            condensation, and deposition are all exothermic processes, involving heat as            intermolecular attractive forces are established or strengthened. The temperatures at            which phase transitions occur are determined by the relative strengths of intermolecular            attractions and are, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of the substance.
The temperature and pressure conditions at which a substance exists in solid, liquid, and            gaseous states are summarized in a phase diagram for that substance. Phase diagrams are            combined plots of three pressure-temperature equilibrium curves: solid-liquid,            liquid-gas, and solid-gas. These curves represent the relationships between            phase-transition temperatures and pressures. The point of intersection of all three            curves represents the substances triple pointthe temperature and pressure at which all            three phases are in equilibrium. At pressures below the triple point, a substance cannot            exist in the liquid state, regardless of its temperature. The terminus of the liquid-gas            curve represents the substances critical point, the pressure and temperature above            which a liquid phase cannot exist.

175,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,X-Ray Crystallography,"The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of            atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by            the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of            travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier            whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are            electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between            neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few angstroms (1  = 1             10 m)).
When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a            crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When            scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo            interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a            decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining            waves maxima are separated as shown below.
Light waves occupying the same space                experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b)                intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and                minima.
When X-rays of a certain wavelength, \xce\xbb, are            scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, d, they may            undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by            the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength.            This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, \xce, is related to the            wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:
n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta
This relation is known as the Bragg equation in            honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. The            illustration below shows two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal            planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in            constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different            angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive            interference.
The diffraction of X-rays scattered by                the atoms within a crystal permits the determination of the distance between the                atoms. The top image depicts constructive interference between two scattered                waves and a resultant diffracted wave of high intensity. The bottom image                depicts destructive interference and a low intensity diffracted                wave.
An X-ray diffractometer, such as the one            illustrated below, may be used to measure the angles at which X-rays are diffracted when            interacting with a crystal as described earlier. From such measurements, the Bragg            equation may be used to compute distances between atoms as demonstrated in the following            example exercise.
(a) In a diffractometer, a beam of                X-rays strikes a crystalline material, producing (b) an X-ray diffraction                pattern that can be analyzed to determine the crystal structure.
In a diffractometer, X-rays with a wavelength                of 0.1315 nm were used to produce a diffraction pattern for copper. The first order                diffraction (n = 1) occurred at an angle \xce = 25.25. Determine the spacing between                the diffracting planes in copper.
The distance between the planes is found by                solving the Bragg equation, \\(n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta\\), for d.

176,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Redox Equations in Acidic Solutions,"In this section, we will concentrate on the half-reaction method for balancing            oxidation-reduction reactions. The use of half-reactions is important for balancing more            complicated reactions and partly because many aspects of electrochemistry, which will be            discussed later in the course, are easier to discuss in terms of half-reactions. The            half-reaction method splits oxidation-reduction reactions into their oxidation chalfd            and reduction chalfd to make finding the overall equation easier.
Electrochemical reactions frequently occur in solutions, which could be acidic, basic, or            neutral. When balancing oxidation-reduction reactions, the nature of the solution may be            important. On this page, we will look at how to balance an oxidation-reduction reaction            in acidic solution.
Consider the following unbalanced oxidation-reduction reaction in acidic solution:
Each half-reaction contains the same element in two different oxidation states. The                Fe2+ has lost an electron to become Fe3+; therefore, the iron            underwent oxidation. The reduction is not as obvious; however, the manganese gained five            electrons to change from Mn7+ (in MnO4-) to                Mn2+.
The iron atoms in the oxidation half-reaction are balanced (mass balance); however, the            charge is unbalanced, since the charges on the ions are not equal. Adding a single            electron on the right side gives a balanced oxidation half-reaction:
The elements of the reduction half-reaction are not balanced. We must add 4 H2O to the            right side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms and we then add 8 H+ ions to the            left side of the equation to balance the hydrogen.
The atoms are balanced (mass balance), so it is now necessary to check for charge            balance. The total charge on the left of the reaction arrow is [()  (1) + (8)             (+1)], or +7, while the total charge on the right side is [(1)  (+2) + (4)  (0)], or            +2. The difference between +7 and +2 is five; therefore, it is necessary to add five            electrons to the left side to achieve charge balance.
We now have two balanced half-reactions.
The number of electrons transferred from the oxidation half-reaction to the reduction            half-reaction must be equal. In this example, it is necessary to multiply every term in            the oxidation half-reaction by five. The multiplication of the two half-reactions by the            appropriate factor followed by addition of the two halves gives
The electrons do not appear in the final answer because the oxidation electrons are the            same electrons as the reduction electrons and they ccancel.d
Balance the following reaction equation in acidic solution:
In acidic solution, we can use or generate hydrogen ions (H+).                                Adding seven water molecules to the left side provides the necessary                                oxygen; the cleft overd hydrogen appears as 14 H+ on the right:
The left side of the equation                                has a total charge of [2  (+3) = +6], and the right side a total                                charge of [ + 14  (+1) = +12]. The difference is six; adding six                                electrons to the right side produces a mass- and charge-balanced                                oxidation half-reaction (in acidic solution):
It is necessary to convert the four oxygen atoms in the                                permanganate into four water molecules. To do this, add eight H+ to                                convert the oxygen into four water molecules:
Add five electrons to the left                                side to balance the charge.
The least common multiple for the electrons is 30, so multiply the oxidation                half-reaction by five, the reduction half-reaction by six.

177,Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:
\\mathrm{Au}^{3+}+3\\mathrm            e^-\\longrightarrow\\mathrm{Au}
Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems",what's the relationship between a solid substance and a suspended substance?,35.5880126953125
178,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Redox Equations in Basic Solutions,"Recall that basic solutions have excess hydroxide ions. Some of these hydroxide ions will            react with hydrogen ions to produce water.

179,Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Colloids,"Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly            basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from            wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain            carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or            sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic            acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic            acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and            contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35            unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the  CO2 unit (shown below).
Soaps contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon                end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end is a carboxylate group. The                length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from soap to soap.
Detergents (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar            hydrocarbon chains, such as C12H25, and an ionic group, such as a            sulfate, or a sulfonate (such            as the detergent shown below). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium compounds in            hard water; detergents form water-soluble productsa definite advantage for            detergents.
Detergents contain a nonpolar                hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a                sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from                detergent to detergent.
The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be            explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon            (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,            nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted            by water (polar), illustrated in the following figure. As a result, the soap or            detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the            water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar            and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a            hydrophobic (cwater-fearingd) part and a hydrophilic (cwater-lovingd) part. As a            consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily            washed away.
This diagrammatic cross section of an                emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent acts as an                emulsifier.
Dispersed colloidal particles are often            electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not            contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the            iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and            the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide            ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have            positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged            dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign.            This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each            other.
The charged nature of some colloidal particles may            be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For example, the particles            comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick            Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The            charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized            and deposited as dust, such as in the Cottrell precipitator shown below. This is one of            the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes.            The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and            flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air            filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.
In a Cottrell precipitator, positively                and negatively charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes,                where they are neutralized and deposited as dust.
Gelatin desserts, such as Jell-O, are a type of            colloid. Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates            as it cools, yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal            dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a solid phase. It appears that the fibers of the            dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled            with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium.
Gelatin desserts are colloids in which                an aqueous solution of sweeteners and flavors is dispersed throughout a medium                of solid proteins. (credit photo: modification of work by Steven                Depolo)
Pectin, a carbohydrate from fruit juices, is a            gel-forming substance important in jelly making.

181,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron                    configurations. The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may                    be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of                    these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron                    shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily                    determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to                    fill their valence shells.
Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by                    the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared                    equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one                    atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The                    ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called                    its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms                    determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical                    atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or                    pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the                    case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.

182,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Colligative Properties of Electrolytes,"As noted previously in this module, the colligative properties of a solution depend only            on the number, not on the kind, of solute species dissolved. For example, 1 mole of any            nonelectrolyte dissolved in 1 kilogram of solvent produces the same lowering of the            freezing point as does 1 mole of any other nonelectrolyte. However, 1 mole of sodium            chloride (an electrolyte) forms 2 moles of ions when dissolved in solution. Each            individual ion produces the same effect on the freezing point as a single molecule            does.
The concentration of ions in seawater is approximately the same as that in a solution                containing 4.2 g of NaCl dissolved in 125 g of water. Assume that each of the ions                in the NaCl solution has the same effect on the freezing point of water as a                nonelectrolyte molecule, and determine the freezing temperature the solution (which                is approximately equal to the freezing temperature of seawater).
Convert from grams to moles of NaCl using the molar mass of NaCl in the unit                conversion factor.
Determine the number of moles of ions present in the solution using the number of                moles of ions in 1 mole of NaCl as the conversion factor (2 mol ions/1 mol                NaCl).
Determine the molality of the ions in the solution from the number of moles of ions                and the mass of solvent, in kilograms.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.
Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the                change.
Assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0 m aqueous solution of NaCl contains 2.0 mole of            ions (1.0 mol Na+ and 1.0 mol Cl) per each kilogram of water, and            its freezing point depression is expected to be
When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured,            however, a value of 3.4 C is obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other            ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured and expected colligative            property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase.            These observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong            electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in solution.
To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total            dissociation, an experimentally measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning            German chemist Jacobus Henricus vant Hoff is used. The vant Hoff factor (i) is defined            as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units            dissolved:
Values for measured vant Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values            assuming complete dissociation, are shown in the table below.
In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich H\xbcckel proposed a theory to explain the            apparent incomplete ionization of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although            interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the            ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The            residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles.          In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a            solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of            any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions            become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual            interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the            effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the            actual concentrations. Note that the vant Hoff factors for the electrolytes in the table above            are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of i for NaCl is 1.9, as            opposed to an ideal value of 2.

183,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Multi-step Conversions,"Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex            problems involving computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the            sameall the factors involved in the calculation must be appropriately oriented to            insure that their labels (units) will appropriately cancel and/or combine to yield the            desired unit in the result. This is why it is referred to as the factor-label method. As            your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this            approach.
Let\'s look at a couple of examples that are a bit more complex
Amanda is 64 inches tall. What is her height in meters?
Notice that on our list of conversion factors there is no direct conversion from                inches to meters. We will take a two-step approach first converting in. to cm and                then cm to m.
One method of using dimensional analysis is to enter the units for the conversion                first and then add in the values. This activity will take you through this                approach.
Your gas tank has a volume of 17.5 gal. What is this measurement in mL?
Since we do not have a direct conversion factor from gal to mL we will go through the                following steps to make this conversion.
Convert 22,500 inches to kilometers. Round your final answer to the correct number of significant figures.
Based on conversion factors that we know we will take the following steps to make this                conversion:
Based on these steps, fill in the conversion factors below.
Let\'s say you want to convert from m to ft. You know that 1 m = 3.2808 ft.                    However, this is a unit of length and not a unit of area so we cannot use this                    conversion factor as is.
If we look at the square above that measures 1 meter by 1 meter, to find the area                    we multiply length times width.
Making conversions involving cubed units of volume is similar. Let\'s say you                    want to convert from in3 to cm3. You know that 1 in. = 2.54 cm. However, this is                    a unit of length not volume so this unit cannot be used directly.
If we look at the cube above that measures 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch, to find                    the volume we multiply length times width times height.
Your friend that lives in Spain tells you that his new apartment is                            55m2. You want to convert the value to ft2 because                        that is the unit of area that you are most familiar with. You know that 1 m                        = 3.2808 ft.
Your friend\'s apartment is 590 square feet.
The volume of a swimming pool is 375,000 dm3. Convert this volume                        to m3.
You know that 1 m = 10 dm. Therefore 1 m3 = (10                        dm)3.

184,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Module Summary and Quiz,"Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a                    constant speed, c, of 2.998 ms-1. This radiation                    shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, \xce\xbd, and a                    wavelength, \xce\xbb, such that c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through                    two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the                    wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive                    and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also                    demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is                    related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as                    E = h\xce\xbd (or E = hc/\xce\xbb ), where h is Planck\'s constant. That light demonstrates                    both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All                    forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various                    forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact                    differently with matter and have very different practical applications.
Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies,                    such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent                    sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). The                    line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from an                    electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple                    enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived                    from the spectrum.
Bohr incorporated Plancks and Einsteins quantization ideas into a model of the                    hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra.                    The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the                    quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described                    the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a                    nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits                    characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits                    result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a                    higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a                    photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon                    of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of                    an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.

185,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Energy of Covalent Bonds,"Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the            strength of a covalent bond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy            necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of bonded atoms requires            energy. The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it.
The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is            called the bond energy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic            molecule, DXY, is defined as the standard enthalpy change for the            endothermic reaction:
For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent HH bond, DHH, is 436 kJ            per mole of HH bonds broken:
Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies            in such a molecule is equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction            that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example, the sum of the four CH bond            energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the            reaction:
The average CH bond energy, DCH, is             \\frac{1660\\;\\mathrm{kJ}}{4\\;\\mathrm{mols}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{bonds}}\\;=\\;415\\;{\extstyle\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{mol}}}            because there are            four moles of CH bonds broken per mole of the reaction. Although the four CH bonds are            equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break;            once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining bonds are            easier to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to            break any one bond.
The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the            bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases.            Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the            same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds            between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in the            table below, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds            appears in the table that follows. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the            bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, CF is 439            kJ/mol, CCl is 330 kJ/mol, and CBr is 275 kJ/mol.
We can use bond energies to calculate approximate enthalpy changes for reactions                    where enthalpies of formation are not available. Calculations of this type will                    also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic                    reaction (\xceH negative, heat produced) results when the                    bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants. An                    endothermic reaction (\xceH positive, heat absorbed)                    results when the bonds in the products are weaker than those in the                    reactants.
The enthalpy change, \xceH, for a chemical reaction is                    approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the                    reactants (energy cind, positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds                    are formed in the products (energy cout,d negative sign). This can be expressed                    mathematically in the following way:
In this expression, the symbol  means cthe sum ofd and D represents the bond                    energy in kilojoules per mole, which is always a positive number. The bond                    energy is obtained from a table, like the Bond Energies table above, and will depend on whether the                    particular bond is a single, double, or triple bond. Thus, in calculating                    enthalpies in this manner, it is important that we consider the bonding in all                    reactants and products. Because D values are typically averages for one type of                    bond in many different molecules, this calculation provides a rough estimate,                    not an exact value, for the enthalpy of reaction.
Using bond energies from the table above, calculate the enthalpy change of                        the following reaction:
or
To form two moles of HCl, one mole of HH bonds and one mole of ClCl bonds                        must be broken. The energy required to break these bonds is the sum of the                        bond energy of the HH bond (436 kJ/mol) and the ClCl bond (243 kJ/mol).                        During the reaction, two moles of HCl bonds are formed (bond energy = 432                        kJ/mol), releasing 2  432 kJ; or 864 kJ. Because the bonds in the products                        are stronger than those in the reactants, the reaction releases more energy                        than it consumes:
Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The                        high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon produces a mixture of the                        gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol                        can be produced. Using the bond energies in Table, calculate the approximate                        enthalpy change, \xceH, for the reaction here:
First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the                        products:
From this, we see that \xceH for this reaction involves                        the energy required to break a CO triple bond and two HH single bonds, as                        well as the energy produced by the formation of three CH single bonds, a                        CO single bond, and an OH single bond. We can express this as follows:
Using the bond energy values in the table above, we obtain:
In the following series of activities, we will calculate the change in                        enthalpy for the reaction below using bond energies.

186,Gases,Gas Laws,The Ideal Gas Law,"To this point, four separate laws have beendiscussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of thegas:
Combining these four laws yields the ideal gaslaw.
The ideal gas lawrelation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws shows the relation between the pressure, volume, temperature,and number of moles of a gas:
relation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles ofthe gas, T is its temperature on the kelvin scale, andR is a constant called the ideal gas constant or theuniversal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, andtemperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required bydimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atmmol  K  and 8.314 kPa L mol  K .
Gases whose properties of P , V , and T are accuratelydescribed by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit idealbehavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypotheticalconstruct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explainthe gas laws as will be described later in this unit. Although all the calculationspresented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable forgases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the finalmodule of this unit, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for thenon-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and lowtemperatures.
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, theideal gas constantconstant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K, R , and the variable properties P , V , n , andT . Specifying any four of these terms will permit use ofthe ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following examples.
constant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K
If the number of moles of an ideal gas are kept constant under two different setsof conditions, a useful mathematical relationship called the combined gas law isobtained:
using units of atm, L, and K. Both sets of conditions are equal to the productof n  R (where n = the number of moles of the gas and R is the idealgas law constant).

188,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ionic Compounds,"The nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is            the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred between atoms and ions            form, ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is,            the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this            case, cations and anions).
electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound
When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an            element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of            electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is            stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite            charge present in the compound.
For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one            electron to form a sodium cation, Na+, and each chlorine atom in a sample of            chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, Cl,            the resulting compound, NaCl, is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio            of one Na+ ion for each Cl ion. Similarly, each calcium atom            (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to            form CaCl2, which is composed of Ca2+ and Cl ions in            the ratio of one Ca2+ ion to two Cl ions.

A compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic            compoundCompound held together by ionic bonds.. The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic:            When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This            guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds            typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always            true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic).
Compound held together by ionic bonds.
You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are            solids that typically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures.            For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and boils at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the            molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C and AlCl3 melts at 180 °C.) In solid form, an ionic            compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow            (celectricityd is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct            electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid.

189,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Determination of Molecular Formulas,"Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a            compounds elements. Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single            molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its            molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by            various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the            mass spectrum of the compound. Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental            methods, many of which will be introduced in later in this course.
Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compounds molecular or molar mass to its            empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of            the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula.
The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the                    empirical formula by n, as shown by the generic empirical formula                        AxBy:
For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be                CH2O. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30            amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one O            atom). If the compounds molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this indicates that            molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the            empirical formula:
Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts            are six times greater than those in the empirical formula:
Note that this same approach may be used when the molar mass (g/mol) instead of the            molecular mass (amu) is used. In this case, we are merely considering one mole of            empirical formula units and molecules, as opposed to single units and molecules.
Nicotine, an alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants that is mainly responsible                for the addictive nature of cigarettes, contains 74.02% C, 8.710% H, and 17.27% N.                If 40.57 g of nicotine contains 0.2500 mol nicotine, what is the molecular                formula?
Determining the molecular formula from the provided data will require comparison of                the compounds empirical formula mass to its molar mass. As the first step, use the                percent composition to derive the compounds empirical formula. Assuming a                convenient, a 100-g sample of nicotine yields the following molar amounts of its                elements:
Next, we calculate the molar ratios of these elements relative to the least abundant                element, N.
The C-to-N and H-to-N molar ratios are adequately close to whole numbers, and so the                empirical formula is C5H7N. The empirical formula mass for                this compound is therefore 81.13 amu/formula unit, or 81.13 g/mol formula unit.
We calculate the molar mass for nicotine from the given mass and molar amount of                compound:
Comparing the molar mass and empirical formula mass indicates that each nicotine                molecule contains two formula units:
Thus, we can derive the molecular formula for nicotine from the empirical formula by                multiplying each subscript by two:

190,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Diagrams,"Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showingthe individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a singlehydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. We wouldexpect to find the electron in the 1s orbital. By convention, the ms = +1/2value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagramare:
Following hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2. The heliumatom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same fourquantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (n = 1, l = 0, ml = 0,ms = +1/2). The second electron also goes into the 1s orbital and fillsthat orbital. The second electron has the same n, l, and ml quantum numbers,but must have the opposite spin quantum number, ms = /2. This is in accordwith the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the sameset of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box(representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in oppositedirections (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagramof helium are:
The n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom.
The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first twoelectrons in lithium fill the 1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbersas the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of nextlowest energy, the 2s orbital. Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram oflithium are:
An atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4, contains fourprotons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus. The fourth electronfills the remaining space in the 2s orbital.
An atom of boron (atomic number 5) contains five electrons. The n = 1 shell is filledwith two electrons and three electrons will occupy the n = 2 shell. Because any ssubshell can contain only two electrons, the fifth electron must occupy the next energylevel, which will be a 2p orbital. There are three 2p orbitals of equal energy (ml= ,, +1) and the electron can occupy any one of these p orbitals. When drawing orbitaldiagrams, we include empty boxes to depict any empty orbitals in the same subshell thatwe are filling.
Carbon (atomic number 6) has six electrons. Four of them fill the 1s and 2s orbitals. Theremaining two electrons occupy the 2p subshell. We now have a choice of filling one ofthe 2p orbitals and pairing the electrons or of leaving the electrons unpaired in twodifferent p orbitals. The orbitals are filled as described by Hunds rulethe lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.: thelowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of orbitals of equalenergy is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the two electronsin the carbon 2p orbitals have identical n, l, and ms quantum numbers anddiffer in their ml quantum number (in accord with the Pauli exclusionprinciple). The electron configuration and orbital diagram for carbon are:
the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the maximum number of unpaired electrons.
Nitrogen (atomic number 7) fills the 1s and 2s subshells and has one electron in each ofthe three 2p orbitals, in accordance with Hunds rule. These three electrons haveunpaired spins. Oxygen (atomic number 8) has a pair of electrons in any one of the 2porbitals (the electrons have opposite spins) and a single electron in each of the othertwo. Fluorine (atomic number 9) has only one 2p orbital containing an unpaired electron.All of the electrons in the noble gas neon (atomic number 10) are paired, and all of theorbitals in the n = 1 and the n = 2 shells are filled. The electron configurations andorbital diagrams of these four elements are:
Note that you can also use the abbreviated electron configurations when writing theorbital diagrams.

191,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Oxidation-Reduction: Reactions,"Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has            been established. Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactionsreaction involving a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements are those in which one or more            elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number. While the vast majority of redox            reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, a few            interesting exceptions to this rule do exist. Definitions for the complementary            processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:
reaction involving a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements
Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified            as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium            chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in            NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in            Cl2 to  in NaCl).
In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its            oxidation number increases from 0 in H2 to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced            (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to  in HCl).
Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including single-displacement            (replacement) reactions. These are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is            displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of            this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals:
Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for            example:
This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved            silver salt. Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of            the copper wire, and the resulting Cu2+ ions dissolve in the solution to            yield a characteristic blue color.
Combustion reactions are redox reactions in which the reductant (also called a                    fuel) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react                    vigorously and produce significant amounts of heat, and often light, in the form                    of a flame. The combustion of methane gas (CH4) is an example.
Although there are other types of combustion reactions, the most common types are                    when a hydrocarbon or an oxygen containing hydrocarbon react with oxygen in the                    air. In both cases the products of the reaction are carbon dioxide and                    water.
One such combustion reaction that you are likely familiar with is the reaction of                    propane (C3H8) burning in air when using a gas grill.
As with the combustion of all hydrocarbons, when the propane burns in air it is                    reacting with the oxygen in the air as seen in this equation.

192,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Solids in Liquids,"The dependence of solubility on temperature for a number of solids in water is shown by            the solubility curves in the graph below. Reviewing these data indicate a general trend            of increasing solubility with temperature, although there are exceptions, as illustrated            by the ionic compound cerium sulfate.
The temperature dependence of solubility can be exploited to prepare supersaturated            solutions of certain compounds. A solution may be saturated with the compound at an            elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a            lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains            solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower            temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the            excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal or by mechanically agitating the            solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one pictured in Figure, take advantage of this            behavior.

Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be made to                    permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Daltons law of                    partial pressures may be used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous                    mixtures to their compositions.

194,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Module Summary and Quiz,"A balanced chemical equation may be used to describe a reactions stoichiometry                    (the relationships between amounts of reactants and products). Coefficients from                    the equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that subsequently may be                    used for computations relating reactant and product masses, molar amounts, and                    other quantitative properties.
When reactions are carried out using less-than-stoichiometric quantities of                    reactants, the amount of product generated will be determined by the limiting                    reactant. The amount of product generated by a chemical reaction is its actual                    yield. This yield is often less than the amount of product predicted by the                    stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation representing the reaction (its                    theoretical yield). The extent to which a reaction generates the theoretical                    amount of product is expressed as its percent yield.
The stoichiometry of chemical reactions may serve as the basis for quantitative                    chemical analysis methods. Titrations involve measuring the volume of a titrant                    solution required to completely react with a sample solution. This volume is                    then used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the sample using the                    stoichiometry of the titration reaction.

Decompression sickness (DCS), or cthe bends,d is an effect of the increased                    pressure of the air inhaled by scuba divers when swimming underwater at                    considerable depths. In addition to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere,                    divers are subjected to additional pressure due to the water above them,                    experiencing an increase of approximately 1 atm for each 10 m of depth.
If the ascent is too rapid, the gases escaping from the divers blood may form                    bubbles that can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from rashes and joint pain                    to paralysis and death. To avoid DCS, divers must ascend from depths at                    relatively slow speeds (10 or 20 m/min) or otherwise make several decompression                    stops, pausing for several minutes at given depths during the ascent.

197,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Module Summary and Quiz,"Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called                    the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An                    aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a                    solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of                    solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very                    useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter                    of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding                    solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple                    relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after                    dilution.
In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used                    in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution                    components masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high                    concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using                    ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other                    fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used.

198,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Module Summary and Assessments,"Properties of a solution that depend only on the concentration of solute particles are                called colligative properties. They include changes in the vapor pressure, boiling                point, and freezing point of the solvent in the solution. The magnitudes of these                properties depend only on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, not                on the type of particles. The total concentration of solute particles in a solution also                determines its osmotic pressure. This is the pressure that must be applied to the                solution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure solvent through a semipermeable                membrane into the solution. Ionic compounds may not completely dissociate in solution                due to activity effects, in which case observed colligative effects may be less than                predicted.

200,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table,"As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number            so that elements with the same chemical properties recur periodically. When their            electron configurations are added to the table as in the periodic table below, we also            see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of            these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play            the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest            energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core            electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties            of the elements.
It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the            chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was            available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it hasthe            arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons in the            same group. This arrangement is emphasized in the periodic table below.
Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the            alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth            metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine            each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements            of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is            the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.
The periodic table can be divided into three categories of elements classified by the            orbitals being filled: main group, transition elements, and inner transition elements.            These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or            highest energy level orbitals of an atom.
Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the            last electron added enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and            red in periodic table below. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as            well as many metals and the intermediate semimetallic elements. The valence electrons            for main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga,            atomic number 31) has the electron configuration                [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence            electrons (underlined). The completely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence,            electrons. Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table. Just as it has 3 valence            electrons all of the elements in group 13 have 3 valence electrons. The periodic table            below indicates the number of valence electrons for each group of the main group            elements.
Transition elements or transition metals are metallic elements in which the last electron            added enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas            configuration) in these elements include the ns and (n  1) d electrons.
Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies            an f orbital. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n             2)f, the (n  1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:
The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)
The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)
Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series,            are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no            f electrons.
The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron                    configuration of an element. However, we do find exceptions to the order of                    filling of orbitals that are indicated by the aufbau principle we have just                    discussed. For instance, the electron configurations of the transition metals                    chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others,                    are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells                    with very similar energy (such as with 4s and 3d), and small effects can lead to                    changes in the order of filling.
In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled                    subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability                    is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the                    extra stability of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in                    Cu). Other exceptions also occur. There is no simple method to predict the                    exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is                    greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.

201,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Module Sumamry and Quiz,"Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for                    atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic                    ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are                    used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a                    Lewis structure. Most structuresespecially those containing second row                    elementsobey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by                    eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules                    (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.
In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating                    each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These                    hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate                    Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as                    possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis                    structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of                    electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance                    hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis                    structures (the resonance forms).
The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that                    is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of                    molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms.                    The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required                    to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed.

202,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Binary Ionic Compounds,"In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the            total number of negative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically            neutral overall, even though they contain positive and negative ions. We can use this            observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic            compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative            charges are equal.
A binary ionic compoundIonic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion. consists of a monatomic (formed from one atom) cation and a            monatomic anion. Note that the ending of the names of monatomic anions are changed to            -ide. For example, sulfide is an ion of sulfur and phosphide is an ion of            phosphorus.
Ionic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion.
Write the chemical formula for potassium sulfide.
Referring to the periodic table, we see that                        potassium will form a 1+ ion and sulfur will form a 2- ion, as illustrated                        in the diagrams below.
In order to obtain a                        neutral compound 2 potassium ions must combine with 1 sulfur ion.
A convenient method to write chemical formulas is by using the criss-cross                    method. In this method the value of the ionic charge for the cation becomes the                    subscript of the anion in the chemical formula and the value of the ionic charge                    of the anion becomes the subscript of the cation in the chemical formula.                    Looking at the previous example we can see how the criss-cross method works.
Like the previous method, the result is K2S. One thing to remember with the                    criss-cross method is that the ratio of ions in a chemical formula of an ionic                    compound must always be in the smallest whole number ratio.
Write the chemical formula for magnesium oxide.
Notice the result of the criss-cross method results in:
This 2:2 ratio of ions is reduced to 1:1, resulting in the formula:
Given the name of a binary ionic compound you can derive the formula and given                    the formula you can name the compound.
Name the compound Li3P.
In all of the examples we have looked at so far the cation in the formula can only                    form one ion. For example, when the calcium atom forms an ion, it is always                        Ca2+ or when potassium forms an ion it is always K+.                    However some of the transition metals can form different ions. For example lead                    can form ion Pb2+ and Pb4+. So when it combines with                    chlorine the result may be PbCl2 or PbCl4. When we write                    the name for each of these formulas we need to indicate whether the compound is                    formed from the Pb2+ and Pb4+ ion. We do this using roman                    numerals. Where the roman numeral indicates the charge of the ion in the                    formula.
Note that not all transition metals can form multiple cations. Here is a list of                    the most common.
Chromium(III)
Cr3+
Manganese(III)
Mn3+
Iron(III)
Fe3+
Cobalt(III)
Co3+
Copper(II)
Cu2+
Mercury(II)
Hg2+
Tin(IV)
Sn4+
Lead(IV)
Pb4+
It is also worth noting that the following metals always form the same ion.                    Silver always forms Ag+. Cadmium always forms Cd2+. Zinc always forms Zn2+.                    Gallium always forms Ga3+. Aluminum always forms Al3+.

204,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,IMFs and Properties of Liquids,"When you pour a glass of water, or fill a car with gasoline, you observe that                    water and gasoline flow freely. But when you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil                    to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The                    viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline,                    and other liquids that flow freely have a low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor                    oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown below, have                    higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a                    metal ball falls through a liquid (the ball falls more slowly through a more                    viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a                    narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly).
The IMFs between the molecules of a liquid, the size and shape of the molecules,                    and the temperature determine how easily a liquid flows. As the table below                    shows, the more structurally complex are the molecules in a liquid and the                    stronger the IMFs between them, the more difficult it is for them to move past                    each other and the greater is the viscosity of the liquid. As the temperature                    increases, the molecules move more rapidly and their kinetic energies are better                    able to overcome the forces that hold them together; thus, the viscosity of the                    liquid decreases.
The various IMFs between identical molecules of a substance are examples of                    cohesive forces. The molecules within a liquid are surrounded by other molecules                    and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within the                    liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by                    about one-half as many molecules. Because of the unbalanced molecular                    attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that                    minimizes the number of molecules on the surfacethat is, the shape with the                    minimum surface area. A small drop of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape,                    as shown below, because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area to volume is                    at a minimum.
Surface tension is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of                    a liquid, or the force required to increase the length of a liquid surface by a                    given amount. This property results from the cohesive forces between molecules                    at the surface of a liquid, and it causes the surface of a liquid to behave like                    a stretched rubber membrane. Surface tensions of several liquids are presented                    in the table below.
Among common liquids, water exhibits a distinctly high surface tension due to                    strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. As a result of this high surface                    tension, the surface of water represents a relatively ctough skind that can                    withstand considerable force without breaking. A steel needle carefully placed                    on water will float. Some insects, like the one shown in Figure, even though                    they are denser than water, move on its surface because they are supported by                    the surface tension.
The IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called                            adhesive forces.  When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus                            (surface) has a concave shape because the water wets the glass and                            creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces                            between mercury atoms are much greater than the adhesive forces between                            mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass, and it forms a                            convex meniscus when confined in a tube because the cohesive forces                            within the mercury tend to draw it into a drop.
If you place one end of a paper towel in spilled wine, as shown below                           , the liquid wicks up the paper towel. A similar process occurs in                            a cloth towel when you use it to dry off after a shower. These are                            examples of capillary actionwhen a liquid flows within a porous                            material due to the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of                            the material and to other liquid molecules. The adhesive forces between                            the liquid and the porous material, combined with the cohesive forces                            within the liquid, may be strong enough to move the liquid upward                            against gravity.
Towels soak up liquids like water because the fibers of a towel are made                            of molecules that are attracted to water molecules. Most cloth towels                            are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp.                            Both consist of long molecules of cellulose that contain many OH                            groups. Water molecules are attracted to these OH groups and form                            hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose                            molecules. The water molecules are also attracted to each other, so                            large amounts of water are drawn up the cellulose fibers.
Capillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is                            immersed in a liquid, as illustrated below. If the liquid molecules                            are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the                            inside of the tube until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive                            forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the                            higher the liquid climbs.

205,Solutions,Solubility,Module Summary and Quiz,"A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that            is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component            and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components            typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form            endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and            solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable            change in energy.
Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may            be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,            acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their            constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is            facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar            water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are            strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are            weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when            dissolved in water.
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several            factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces            that may exist between the substances atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to            dissolve is quantified as a substances solubility, its maximum concentration in a            solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute            at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a            solutes concentration exceeds its solubilitya nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that            will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.            Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low            mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing            temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.            The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial            pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henrys            law.

207,Gases,Gas Laws,Module Summary and Quiz,"The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations            of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to            its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Gay-Lussac\'s law).            The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at            constant pressure (Charless law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely            proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyles law). Under the            same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same            number of molecules (Avogadros law).
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the            gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

208,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Module Summary and Quiz,"The physical properties of condensed matter (liquids and solids) can be explained in            terms of the kinetic molecular theory. In a liquid, intermolecular attractive forces            hold the molecules in contact, although they still have sufficient KE to move past each            other.
Intermolecular attractive forces, collectively referred to as van der Waals forces, are            responsible for the behavior of liquids and solids and are electrostatic in nature.            Dipole-dipole attractions result from the electrostatic attraction of the partial            negative end of one dipolar molecule for the partial positive end of another. The            temporary dipole that results from the motion of the electrons in an atom can induce a            dipole in an adjacent atom and give rise to the London dispersion force. London forces            increase with increasing molecular size. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of            dipole-dipole attraction that results when hydrogen is bonded to one of the three most            electronegative elements: F, O, or N.
The intermolecular forces between molecules in the liquid state vary depending upon their            chemical identities and result in corresponding variations in various physical            properties. Cohesive forces between like molecules are responsible for a liquids            viscosity (resistance to flow) and surface tension (elasticity of a liquid surface).            Adhesive forces between the molecules of a liquid and different molecules composing a            surface in contact with the liquid are responsible for phenomena such as surface wetting            and capillary rise.

209,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Module Summary and Quiz,"The formula mass of a substance is the sum of the average atomic masses of each                    atom represented in the chemical formula and is expressed in atomic mass units.                    The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular mass. A                    convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules                    is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities                    composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 , a quantity called                    Avogadros number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass.                    Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit                    and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) for any substance                    are numerically equivalent (for example, one H2O molecule weighs                    approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H2O molecules weighs approximately                    18 g).
The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers                    of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent                    compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compounds percent                    composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it                    is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compounds empirical                    formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to                    the compounds molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula.

210,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions,"The ions that we have discussed so far are called monatomic ions, that is, they are ions            formed from only one atom. We also find many polyatomic ionsions composed of more than one atom. These ions, which act as            discrete units, are electrically charged molecules (a group of bonded atoms with an            overall charge). Some of the more important polyatomic ions are listed in Table.            Oxyanions are polyatomic ions that contain one or more oxygen atoms. At this point in            your study of chemistry, you should memorize the names, formulas, and charges of the            most common polyatomic ions. Because you will use them repeatedly, they will soon become            familiar.
ions composed of more than one atom
Note that there is a system for naming some polyatomic ions; -ate and -ite are suffixes            designating polyatomic ions containing more or fewer oxygen atoms. Per- (short for            chyperd) and hypo- (meaning cunderd) are prefixes meaning more oxygen atoms than -ate            and fewer oxygen atoms than -ite, respectively. For example, perchlorate is                ClO4, chlorate is ClO3, chlorite is                ClO2 and hypochlorite is ClO. Unfortunately, the            number of oxygen atoms corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for            example, nitrate is NO3 while sulfate is SO42.
Many ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions as the cation, the anion, or both. As with            simple ionic compounds, these compounds must also be electrically neutral, so their            formulas can be predicted by treating the polyatomic ions as discrete units. We use            parentheses in a formula to indicate a group of atoms that behave as a unit. For            example, the formula for calcium phosphate, one of the minerals in our bones, is                Ca3(PO4)2. This formula indicates that there are            three calcium ions (Ca2+) for every two phosphate                (PO43) groups. The PO43 groups are            discrete units, each consisting of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms, and having            an overall charge of 3. The compound is electrically neutral, and its formula shows a            total count of three Ca, two P, and eight O atoms.
We can apply the same steps as we saw earlier with addition of parenthesis where            necessary.
Write the chemical formula for calcium nitrate.
The 2 becomes the subscript for the nitrate ion and the 1 becomes the subscript for                the calcium ion.
Ca(NO3)2
Notice we use parenthesis around the NO3. To represent more than one of                the same polyatomic ion in a formula, you must use parenthesis.
Write the chemical formula for ammonium carbonate.
(NH4)2CO3
We can also apply the general steps for naming ionic compounds to compounds with                    polyatomic ions.
It is helpful to note that there are not many positive polyatomic ions. You\'ll                    notice the only one on the list above is ammonium (NH4+). When                    identifying the cation and anion in an ionic compound in most cases, with the                    exception of compounds containing ammonium, the first element is the cation and                    the rest of the formula represents the anion.
We see in the example above the cation is potassium and the rest of the formula                        C2H3O2 is the anion acetate. Giving the                    name: potassium acetate
In this example the cation is barium and the rest of the formula                        Cr2O7 is the anion dichromate. Giving the name: Barium dichromate

211,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Module Summary and Quiz,"Chemical equations are symbolic representations of chemical and physical changes.                    Formulas for the substances undergoing the change (reactants) and substances                    generated by the change (products) are separated by an arrow and preceded by                    integer coefficients indicating their relative numbers. Balanced equations are                    those whose coefficients result in equal numbers of atoms for each element in                    the reactants and products. Chemical reactions in aqueous solution that involve                    ionic reactants or products may be represented more realistically by complete                    ionic equations and, more succinctly, by net ionic equations.
Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A                    large number of important reactions are included in three categories:                    precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation                    reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base                    reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants. Redox                    reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant                    elements.

212,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Temperature Conversions,"We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change             in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract             when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume             as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we             can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler.
To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the             freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, at a pressure of 1.0 atm, 0 °C             is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 °C as the boiling temperature of water. The space             between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit             scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 °F and the boiling temperature as 212 °F. The space between             these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).
Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a             slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units             of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to             one another (y = mx).

To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit             scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature             that can theoretically be achieved. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas\'s volume and             temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at .15 °C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson,             who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment             of this topic is provided later in this course).  A degree Celsius is the same size as  a Kelvin.

To convert Kelvin to Celsius:
Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in             many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world. Very             few countries (the U.S. and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, and Palau) still use Fahrenheit             for weather, medicine, and cooking.
