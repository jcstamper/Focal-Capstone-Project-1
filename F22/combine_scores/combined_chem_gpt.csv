0,416,418,71,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Waves,"Electromagnetic energy travels through space in waves. So understanding wave            characteristics is important in understanding electromagnetic energy. A wave is an            oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to            another. Common examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers            energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes            waves to ripple outward along the water\'s surface, and the expansion of air that            accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward            for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter            (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place.
Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. Electromagnetic waves consist of            an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which            are perpendicular to the direction of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at            a constant speed of \\(2.998\^8\\) m/s, the speed of light (denoted by c).
All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by: a            wavelength (denoted by \xce\xbb, the lowercase Greek letter lambda); a frequency (denoted by \xce\xbd,            the lowercase Greek letter nu); and an amplitude (denoted by A). As can be seen in diagrams below, the            wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured            in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an            enormous range - wavelengths of kilometers (103 m) to picometers            (10-12 m) have been observed. The frequency (the rate of oscillation) is the number of wave cycles            that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system,            time is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit            for frequency, expressed as cycles per second (s), is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples            of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = \\(1\^6\\) Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = \\(1\^9\\)            Hz). The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave\'s            displacement and so, as shown in the figure below, this corresponds to one-half the height between the            peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for            light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness. Brighter lights have a greater amplitude than dimmer lights and louder sounds have a greater amplitude than quieter sounds.
The product of a wave\'s wavelength (\xce\xbb) and its frequency (\xce\xbd), \xce\xbb\xce\xbd, is the speed of the                    wave. For electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum:
c\\;=\\;\\lambda\u
where c is the speed at which electromagnetic energy travels (\\(2.998\^8\\)>                    m/s).
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: as the wavelength increases, the            frequency decreases. The inverse proportionality is illustrated in figure below. This            figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of            electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific            frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light            makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies            developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for            reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for            different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as            frequencies (typically in units of MHz), while the visible region is usually specified            in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms).
A sodium streetlight gives off yellow light that has a wavelength of 589 nm \\(1\\;\\mathrm{nm}\\;=\\;1\^{-9}\\;\\mathrm m\\). What is the frequency of this light?
We can rearrange the equation c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd to solve for the frequency:
\u=\\frac c\\lambda\\;
Since c is expressed in meters per second, we must also convert 589 nm to meters.
\equire{cancel}\u=\\left(\\frac{2.998\^8\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm m}\\mathrm s^{-1}}{589\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{nm}}}\ight)\\left(\\frac{1\^9\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm{nm}}}{1\\;\\cancel{\\mathrm m}}\ight)\\;=\\;5.09\^{14}\\;\\mathrm s^{-1}

1,541,543,87,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Lattice Energy,"An ionic compound is stable because of the electrostatic attraction between its positive            and negative ions. The lattice energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this            attraction. The lattice energy (\xceHlattice)energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its component gaseous ions of an            ionic compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into            its component gaseous ions. For the ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy            change of the process:
energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its component gaseous ions
Note that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so            our lattice energies will be endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the            equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the energy released when            separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus,            if you are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which            definition is being used. In both cases, a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates            a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, \xceHlattice = 769 kJ. Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of            solid NaCl into gaseous Na+ and Cl ions. When one mole each of            gaseous Na+ and Cl ions form solid NaCl, 769 kJ of heat is released.
The lattice energy \xceHlattice of an ionic crystal can                    be expressed by the following equation (derived from Coulombs law, governing the forces                    between electric charges):
in which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal                    structure; Z+ and Z are the charges on the ions; and                     Ro is the                    interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions).
            The lattice energy of an ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase            and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other parameters are kept constant,            doubling the charge of both the cation and anion quadruples the lattice energy. For            example, the lattice energy of LiF (Z+ and Z = 1) is 1023 kJ/mol,            whereas that of MgO (Z+ and Z = 2) is 3900 kJ/mol (Ro is nearly the sameabout 200 pm for both            compounds).
Different interatomic distances produce different lattice energies. For example, we can            compare the lattice energy of MgF2 (2957 kJ/mol) to that of MgI2            (2327 kJ/mol) to observe the effect on lattice energy of the smaller ionic size of            F as compared to I. The difference between lattice energies            of compounds is significantly more dependent on the charges of the ions rather than the            size of the ions because the variations between the sizes of the ions is relatively            small.
Which has the larger lattice energy, Al2O3 or                Al2Se3?
In these two ionic compounds, the charges Z+ and Z are the                same, so the difference in lattice energy will depend upon Ro. The                O2 ion is smaller than the Se2 ion. Thus,                Al2O3 would have a shorter interionic distance than                Al2Se3, and Al2O3 would have the                larger lattice energy.

2,1418,1423,210,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Binary Ionic Compounds,"In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the            total number of negative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically            neutral overall, even though they contain positive and negative ions. We can use this            observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic            compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative            charges are equal.
A binary ionic compoundIonic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion. consists of a monatomic (formed from one atom) cation and a            monatomic anion. Note that the ending of the names of monatomic anions are changed to            -ide. For example, sulfide is an ion of sulfur and phosphide is an ion of            phosphorus.
Ionic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion.
Write the chemical formula for potassium sulfide.
Referring to the periodic table, we see that                        potassium will form a 1+ ion and sulfur will form a 2- ion, as illustrated                        in the diagrams below.
In order to obtain a                        neutral compound 2 potassium ions must combine with 1 sulfur ion.
A convenient method to write chemical formulas is by using the criss-cross                    method. In this method the value of the ionic charge for the cation becomes the                    subscript of the anion in the chemical formula and the value of the ionic charge                    of the anion becomes the subscript of the cation in the chemical formula.                    Looking at the previous example we can see how the criss-cross method works.
Like the previous method, the result is K2S. One thing to remember with the                    criss-cross method is that the ratio of ions in a chemical formula of an ionic                    compound must always be in the smallest whole number ratio.
Write the chemical formula for magnesium oxide.
Notice the result of the criss-cross method results in:
This 2:2 ratio of ions is reduced to 1:1, resulting in the formula:
Given the name of a binary ionic compound you can derive the formula and given                    the formula you can name the compound.
Name the compound Li3P.
In all of the examples we have looked at so far the cation in the formula can only                    form one ion. For example, when the calcium atom forms an ion, it is always                        Ca2+ or when potassium forms an ion it is always K+.                    However some of the transition metals can form different ions. For example lead                    can form ion Pb2+ and Pb4+. So when it combines with                    chlorine the result may be PbCl2 or PbCl4. When we write                    the name for each of these formulas we need to indicate whether the compound is                    formed from the Pb2+ and Pb4+ ion. We do this using roman                    numerals. Where the roman numeral indicates the charge of the ion in the                    formula.
Note that not all transition metals can form multiple cations. Here is a list of                    the most common.

It is also worth noting that the following metals always form the same ion.                    Silver always forms Ag+. Cadmium always forms Cd2+. Zinc always forms Zn2+.                    Gallium always forms Ga3+. Aluminum always forms Al3+.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by            side reactions that generate other products. Some products are difficult to collect            without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

4,1002,1006,139,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Gases in Liquids,"The chemical structures of the solute and solvent dictate the types of forces possible            and, consequently, are important factors in determining solubility. For example, under            similar conditions, the water solubility of oxygen is approximately three times greater            than that of helium, but 100 times less than the solubility of chloromethane,                CHCl3. Considering the role of the solvents chemical structure, note            that the solubility of oxygen in the liquid hydrocarbon hexane,                C6H14, is approximately 20 times greater than it is in            water.
Other factors also affect the solubility of a given substance in a given solvent.            Temperature is one such factor, with gas solubility typically decreasing as temperature            increases, as seen in the graph below. This is one of the major impacts resulting from            the thermal pollution of natural bodies of water.
When the temperature of a river, lake, or stream is raised abnormally high, usually due            to the discharge of hot water from some industrial process, the solubility of oxygen in            the water is decreased. Decreased levels of dissolved oxygen may have serious            consequences for the health of the waters ecosystems and, in severe cases, can result            in large-scale fish kills.
The solubility of a gaseous solute is also affected by the partial pressure of solute in            the gas to which the solution is exposed. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of            the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration of this            relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively            high pressure of carbon dioxide gas and then sealing the beverage container, thus            saturating the beverage with CO2 at this pressure. When the beverage            container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is            released, and some of the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in            the form of small bubbles. At this point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon            dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration will decrease to its            equilibrium value and the beverage will become cflat.d
For many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility and partial pressure is a            proportional one and can be determined using Henry\'s law.
The quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is                    directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.
where Cg is solubility, Pg is partial pressure, and k                    is a proportionality constant that depends on the identities of the gaseous                    solute and solvent, and on the solution temperature.
At 20 C, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water exposed to gaseous oxygen at                a partial pressure of 101.3 kPa is 1.38  10 mol L. Use                Henrys law to determine the solubility of oxygen when its partial pressure is 20.7                kPa, the approximate pressure of oxygen in earths atmosphere.
According to Henrys law, for an ideal solution the solubility, Cg, of a gas (1.38  10 mol L, in                this case) is directly proportional to the pressure, Pg, of the undissolved gas above the solution (101.3 kPa in                this case). Because we know both Cg and Pg, we can rearrange this expression to solve for                    k.
Now we can use k to find the solubility at the lower pressure.
Notice that as the pressure decreased from 101.3 kPa to 20.7 kPa the concentration also decreased,                 illustrating the direct proportionality of pressure and concentration of a gas in a liquid.

However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.

6,1022,1026,142,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,The Structures of Ionic Crystals,"Ionic crystals consist of two or more different            kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these ions into a            crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same            size.
Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and            their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every direction.            Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge            are surrounded by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the            cations and anions are in contact with each other. Structures are determined by two            principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of            positive and negative ions in the compound.
In simple ionic structures, we usually find the            anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a closest-packed array.            (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions            larger and fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when            compared to the atoms from which they are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy            one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the anions. The smaller of            the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane.            The four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so            the hole is called a tetrahedral hole. The larger type of hole is found at the center of            six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at the corners of            an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. The figure below illustrates both of            these types of holes.
Cations may occupy two types of holes                between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes.
Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and            anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or octahedral holes, as            illustrated in the figure below. Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and            larger cations occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the            octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open structure, such as a simple cubic            array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the            more open spacing.
A cations size and the shape of the                hole occupied by the compound are directly related.
There are two tetrahedral holes for each anion in            either an HCP or CCP array of anions. A compound that crystallizes in a closest-packed            array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes can have a maximum cation:anion            ratio of 2:1; all of the tetrahedral holes are filled at this ratio. Examples include            Li2O, Na2O, Li2S, and Na2S. Compounds            with a ratio of less than 2:1 may also crystallize in a closest-packed array of anions            with cations in the tetrahedral holes, if the ionic sizes fit. In these compounds,            however, some of the tetrahedral holes remain vacant.
The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either            an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1. Thus, compounds with cations in octahedral holes in a            closest-packed array of anions can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 1:1. In NiO,            MnS, NaCl, and KH, for example, all of the octahedral holes are filled. Ratios of less            than 1:1 are observed when some of the octahedral holes remain empty.
In a simple cubic array of anions, there is one            cubic hole that can be occupied by a cation for each anion in the array. In CsCl, and in            other compounds with the same structure, all of the cubic holes are occupied. Half of            the cubic holes are occupied in SrH2, UO2, SrCl2, and            CaF2.
Different types of ionic compounds often            crystallize in the same structure when the relative sizes of their ions and their            stoichiometries (the two principal features that determine structure) are similar. Many            ionic compounds crystallize with cubic unit cells, and we will use these compounds to            describe the general features of ionic structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of cations and            anions of similar size in a 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple cubic structure.            Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated below) is an example of this, with Cs+ and Cl            having radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions            forming a simple cubic unit cell, with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions            forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple cubic unit cells            formed by Cs+ ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cl ions.            Cesium ions and chloride ions touch along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One            cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry            required by the formula for cesium chloride. Note that there is no lattice point in the            center of the cell, and CsCl is not a BCC structure because a cesium ion is not            identical to a chloride ion.
Ionic compounds with similar-sized                cations and anions, such as CsCl, usually form a simple cubic structure. They                can be described by unit cells with either cations at the corners or anions at                the corners.
We have said that the location of lattice points is            arbitrary. This is illustrated by an alternate description of the CsCl structure in            which the lattice points are located in the centers of the cesium ions. In this            description, the cesium ions are located on the lattice points at the corners of the            cell, and the chloride ion is located at the center of the cell. The two unit cells are            different, but they describe identical structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio            of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically crystallizes with            an FCC unit cell, like that shown below. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this,            with Na+ and Cl having radii of 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively.            We can think of this as chloride ions forming an FCC cell, with sodium ions located in            the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell. The            sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains            four sodium ions and four chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the            formula, NaCl.
Ionic compounds with anions that are                much larger than cations, such as NaCl, usually form an FCC structure. They can                be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral                holes.
The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also            crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated below. This structure contains sulfide            ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is            identical to the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc            ion is only about 40% of the radius of a sulfide ion, so these small Zn2+            ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the            tetrahedral holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell,            giving the empirical formula ZnS.
ZnS, zinc sulfide (or zinc blende)                forms an FCC unit cell with sulfide ions at the lattice points and much smaller                zinc ions occupying half of the tetrahedral holes in the                structure.
A calcium fluoride unit cell, like that shown in            the following figure, is also an FCC unit cell, but in this case, the cations are            located on the lattice points; equivalent calcium ions are located on the lattice points            of an FCC lattice. All of the tetrahedral sites in the FCC array of calcium ions are            occupied by fluoride ions. There are four calcium ions and eight fluoride ions in a unit            cell, giving a calcium:fluorine ratio of 1:2, as required by the chemical formula,            CaF2. Close examination of the figure will reveal a simple cubic array of            fluoride ions with calcium ions in one half of the cubic holes. The structure cannot be            described in terms of a space lattice of points on the fluoride ions because the            fluoride ions do not all have identical environments. The orientation of the four            calcium ions about the fluoride ions differs.
Calcium fluoride, CaF2,                forms an FCC unit cell with calcium ions (green) at the lattice points and                fluoride ions (red) occupying all of the tetrahedral sites between                them.",,"The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also            crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated below.

7,194,194,39,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Phase Changes,"When a liquid is heated the kinetic energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions                    increases. At some point the KE is great enough to overcome the forces holding                    the substance together in the liquid phase and the particles escape into the gas                    phase. This is called vaporization. If a gaseous substance is cooled, at some                    point, it will change into its liquid phase. This is known as condensation.
When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms,                    molecules, or ions and the solid gets hotter. At some point, the added energy                    becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or                    ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of                    transitioning to the liquid state, or melting. If we cool a liquid, the kinetic                    energy decreases. At some point, the IMFs will become greater than the KE and                    the substance will be held tightly together in a fixed position, which we call                    freezing.
Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid                    state, via a process known as sublimation. At room temperature and standard                    pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to                    gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid.                     When solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms                    as seen in the image below. The reverse of sublimation is called deposition, a process in which                    gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid                    state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition.

Mass measurements of the sample, the isolated            analyte, or some other component of the analysis system, used along with the known            stoichiometry of the compounds involved, permit calculation of the analyte            concentration.

9,504,506,79,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Gas Density and Molar Mass,"One important application of the ideal gas law is to determine its molar mass and thereby            assist in its identification using the measured density of the gas. Review the            interactive below to see the derivation of the formula used to calculate the molar mass            of a gas from its density.
Press ""NEXT"" to advance slide show.
The molar mass of a gas can be determined given its density, temperature, and pressure            with the following equation:
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
Where d = density, R = ideal gas law            constant, T = temperature, and P = pressure.
A gas was found to have a density of 0.0847 g/L at 17.0 C and a pressure of 760                torr. What is its molar mass? What is the gas?
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
As before when using the ideal gas law constant, we need to ensure that the units in                the constant match the units used for the other variables and as before when using                the ideal gas law equation temperature must be in K. First we will convert the                pressure to units of atm. You will recall that 760 torr = 1 atm.
\equire{cancel} \equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{(0.0847                    \\mathrm{g/}\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}})( 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(290                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}}
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = 2.02 \\mathrm{g/mol}
The gas is hydrogen, H2.
This equation can also be used to determine the density of a known gas at a given            temperature and pressure.
Calculate the density of chlorine gas (Cl2) at 22 oC and 735 torr.
We can use the molar mass of a gas equation,
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
rearranging it to solve for density.
\equire{mathrsfs} d = \\frac{\\mathscr{M}P}{RT}
Because we know the identity of the gas, we can easily calculate its molar mass and                substitute it and the other given values (making the necessary conversions) into the                equation.

10,1122,1126,160,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two                    separate atomic orbitals on different atoms that creates a region with one pair                    of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along an                    axis containing the nuclei, they form a  bond. When they overlap in a fashion                    that creates a node along this axis, they form a  bond.
We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of                    the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently                    bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma () bonds directed toward                    other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine                    the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions                    of electron density about it. Two such regions imply sp hybridization; three,                        sp2 hybridization; four, sp3 hybridization; five, sp3d                    hybridization; and six, sp3d2 hybridization. Pi () bonds                    are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals).
Multiple bonds consist of a  bond located along the axis between two atoms and                    one or two  bonds. The  bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized                    atomic orbitals, while the  bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of                    unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized                    orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of  bonds                    can vary.

11,1404,1409,209,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Module Sumamry and Quiz,"Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for                    atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic                    ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are                    used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a                    Lewis structure. Most structuresespecially those containing second row                    elementsobey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by                    eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules                    (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.
In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating                    each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These                    hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate                    Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as                    possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis                    structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of                    electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance                    hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis                    structures (the resonance forms).
The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that                    is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of                    molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms.                    The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required                    to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed.

12,1444,1449,217,Gases,Gas Laws,Module Summary and Quiz,"The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations            of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to            its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Gay-Lussac\'s law).            The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at            constant pressure (Charless law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely            proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyles law). Under the            same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same            number of molecules (Avogadros law).
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the            gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

13,1118,1122,158,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Bonding in Diatomic Molecules,"A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the                    atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular                    orbital of lowest energy, the s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,                        H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule                    is lower than that of two H atoms. The s orbital that contains both                    electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.
A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the                        H2 molecule are in the s bonding orbital; the electron                    configuration is (s)2. We represent this configuration                    by a molecular orbital energy diagram seen below in which a single upward arrow                    indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows                    indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons                    so we have
Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single                    bond.
A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium                    atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule, He2, with four                    electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the                    lower-energy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the                    two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital. We would write                    the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as                        (s)2(s)2 as seen in the                    diagram below The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force                    for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as                    discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a                    hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero.
A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.
Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the                    second period of the periodic table: Li2, Be2,                        B2, C2, N2, O2, F2,                    and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the                        Ne2 molecule would not be stable. We can see this by a                    consideration of the molecular electron configurations in the table below.
We predict ground state valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict                    electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence                    molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hunds                    rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons                    fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes                    place.
As we saw in valence bond theory,  bonds are generally more stable than  bonds                    formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory,                     orbitals are usually more stable than  orbitals. However, this is not always                    the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in                    below. Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is                    consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for                    atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe                    a different pattern, in which the p orbital is higher in energy than                    the p set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear                    diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral                    molecule.
This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing.                    s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of                    the existing molecular orbitals. The s wavefunction mathematically combines                    with the p wavefunction, with the result that the s orbital becomes                    more stable, and the p orbital becomes less stable, as seen int the                    energy diagram below. Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p                    mixing, with the \\(\\sigma_s^\\ast\\) becoming more stable and the \\(\\sigma_p^\\ast\\)                    becoming less stable.
s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. The energy                    difference between 2s and 2p orbitals in O, F, and Ne is greater than that in                    Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and                        Ne2 exhibit negligible s-p mixing (not sufficient to change the                    energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown                    above. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which                    leads to the pattern where the p orbital is raised above the                        p set.
Using the MO diagrams shown, we can add in the electrons and determine the                    molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic                    molecules. As shown in the table above, Be2 and Ne2                    molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.
The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li2,                    is analogous to the formation of H2, but the atomic orbitals involved                    are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence                    electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the s                    bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding                    orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule                    is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at                    temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules                    in the table above with a bond order greater than zero are also known.
The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the                        (py,pz) level. We expect the two electrons that                    occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular                    electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the fact that the                    oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons, as seen in the energy diagram in the                    example below. The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult                    to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it                    quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a                    strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.
Draw the molecular orbital diagram for the oxygen molecule, O2.                        From this diagram, calculate the bond order for O2. How does this                        diagram account for the paramagnetism of O2?
We draw a molecular orbital energy diagram. Each oxygen atom contributes six                        electrons, so the diagram appears as shown below.
We calculate the bond order as
Oxygen\'s paramagnetism is explained by the presence of two unpaired electrons                        in the (py, pz)* molecular orbitals.
Give the molecular orbital configuration for the valence electrons in                            C22. Will this ion be stable?
Looking at the appropriate MO diagram, we see that the  orbitals are lower                        in energy than the p orbital. The valence electron configuration                        for C2 is                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4.                        Adding two more electrons to generate the C22 anion will give a                        valence electron configuration of                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4(px)2.                        Since this has six more bonding electrons than antibonding, the bond order                        will be 3, and the ion should be stable.

14,869,872,120,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Pressure-Volume Work,"A type of work called pressure-volume work occurs when a system pushes back the            surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the            system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine.            The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as            heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder.
The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of            the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing            work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep            the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine            is running.)
The work done on the surroundings by the system or on the system by the surroundings can            be calculated with the following equation:
Where                                     Δ                    V                                         =                                                                 V                        final                                                             −                                                                 V                        initial                                                
The negative sign in the above equation is present because when the gas expands (when                    \xceV                is positive), the system does work on the surroundings (w                is negative).

15,1147,1151,165,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Single-step Conversions,"Sometimes it is necessary to convert a measurement from one unit to another. For            instance, if a measurement is given in miles it may be convenient or necessary to            convert it to km or m. Dimensional analysisMethod used to convert from one unit of measure to another. (or factor-label method) is a method used to            convert from one unit of measure to another. Dimensional analysis is based on this            premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations            as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from            simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several            different quantities.
Method used to convert from one unit of measure to another.
A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be            used as a unit conversion factorratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are            equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the            ratio,
ratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit
Several other commonly used equalities are given in table below.
*Note in the table above, that the English units ounces (oz) and fluid ounces (fl oz) are            often both referred to as ounces in everyday use. However, they are distinctly different            as oz is a unit of mass and fl oz is a unit of volume.
When we multiply a quantity (such as distance given in inches) by an appropriate unit            conversion factor, we convert the quantity to an equivalent value with different units            (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball players vertical jump of            34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:
When we multiply by the unit factor                \\frac{2.54\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{in}.} we do not change            the value of the measurement because 2.54 cm is equivalent to 1 in.
The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit                conversion factor derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g.
We can form two conversion factors from the relationship between ounces and                grams.
To determine which conversion factor to use to make the conversion, we need to look                carefully at the units. Since we are converting from g to oz, we want the unit of g                to cancel out. The unit factor that causes the unit of g to cancel is:
Notice that the unit of g cancels, leaving the unit of ounces. Also, notice that the                final answer has 3 significant figures because the original measurement has 3                significant figures. In this context, the 1 in 1 oz is an exact number and has an                infinite number of significant figures.

16,1436,1441,213,Solutions,Solubility,Module Summary and Quiz,"A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that            is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component            and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components            typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form            endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and            solvent intermolecular attractive forces.

Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may            be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,            acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their            constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is            facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar            water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are            strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are            weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when            dissolved in water.
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several            factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces            that may exist between the substances atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to            dissolve is quantified as a substances solubility, its maximum concentration in a            solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute            at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a            solutes concentration exceeds its solubilitya nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that            will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.            Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low            mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing            temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.            The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial            pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henrys            law.

17,547,549,88,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Limiting Reactants,"The relative amounts of reactants and products represented in a balanced chemical            equation are often referred to as stoichiometric amounts. All the exercises of the            preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For example, when            calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was            assumed that any other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or            greater). In this module, more realistic situations are considered, in which reactants            are not present in stoichiometric amounts.
Consider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches:
Stoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese            slices in a 2:1 ratio. Provided with 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese, one may            prepare 11 sandwiches per the provided recipe, using all the provided cheese and having            six slices of bread left over. In this scenario, the number of sandwiches prepared has            been limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been provided in            excess.
Consider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen            with chlorine to yield hydrogen chloride:
The balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric            ratio. If these reactants are provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will            nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting the amount of product that may be            generated. This substance is the limiting reactantreactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated, and the other substance is the            excess reactantreactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation            requires computing the molar amounts of each reactant provided and comparing them to the            stoichiometric amounts represented in the balanced chemical equation. For example,            imagine combining 3 moles of H2 and 2 moles of Cl2.            This represents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction,            which is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Hydrogen, therefore, is present            in excess, and chlorine is the limiting reactant. Reaction of all the provided chlorine            (2 mol) will consume 2 mol of the 3 mol of hydrogen provided, leaving 1 mol of hydrogen            unreacted.
reactant present in an amount lower than required by the reaction stoichiometry, thus limiting the amount of product generated
reactant present in an amount greater than required by the reaction stoichiometry
An alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the            amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant            amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per            the reactions stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the            limiting reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the            hydrogen would yield
Complete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce
The chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced.            Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl, there will be unreacted            hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting            reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant.

Silicon nitride is a very hard, high-temperature-resistant ceramic used as a                component of turbine blades in jet engines. It is prepared according to the                following equation:
Which is the limiting reactant when 2.00 g of Si and 1.50 g of N2                react?
After you have determined the limiting reactant, calculate the mass of                Si3N4 that will be produced.
Compute the provided molar amounts of reactants, and then compare these amounts to                the balanced equation to identify the limiting reactant.
The provided Si:N2 molar ratio is:
The stoichiometric Si:N2 ratio is:
Comparing these ratios shows that Si is provided in a less-than-stoichiometric                amount, and so it is the limiting reactant.
Alternatively, compute the amount of product expected for complete reaction of each                of the provided reactants.
Since silicon yields the lesser amount of product, it is the limiting reactant.
Now that we know that silicon is the limiting reactant, we can determine the mass of                the product produced. The amount of product(s) produced is always determined by the                amount of the limiting reactant.
We have previously calculated that 0.02373 mol Si3N4 is                produced by the limiting reactant. Convert mol Si3N4 to g                Si3N4.

18,621,623,92,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure,"The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and            the molecular structures:
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for CO2.
We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:
This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atomeach double                bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using                VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves                on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of 180. The electron-pair                geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are                linear.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure for BCl3.
We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:
Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of                electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives                a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The BCl bonds lie in a plane with 120                angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular structure.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of a water molecule.
The Lewis structure of H2O indicates that there are four regions of high                electron density around the oxygen atom: two lone pairs and two chemical bonds:
We predict that these four regions are arranged in a tetrahedral fashion. Thus, the                electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular structure is bent with an                angle slightly less than 109.5. In fact, the bond angle is 104.5.
Predict the electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of SF4.
The Lewis structure of SF4 indicates five regions of electron density                around the sulfur atom: one lone pair and four bonding pairs:
We predict that these five regions of electron density are arranged to give a                trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry. The one lone-pair on the sulfur will                occupy a position in the equitorial plane, giving a seesaw molecular geometry.
When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular                    structure completely describes the shape of the molecule. Larger molecules do                    not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms                    that each possess a clocald geometry. The way these local structures are                    oriented with respect to each other also influences the molecular shape, but                    such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory                    discussion. For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local                    structures.
The Lewis structure for the simplest amino acid, glycine,                            H2NCH2CO2H, is shown here. Predict the                        local geometry for the nitrogen atom, the two carbon atoms, and the oxygen                        atom with a hydrogen atom attached:
Consider each central atom independently.

We can use the wedge and dash notation when drawing the Lewis structure to                        better represent the local shapes within the molecule.

19,280,281,50,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Derived Quantities,"We can derive many quantities from the seven SI base quantities. For example, we can use the base            quantity of length to define volume, and the base quantities of mass and length to            define density.
                        Volume                                                                                    amount of space occupied by an object.                                                                         is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The                    standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length. The standard                    volume is a cubic meter (m3), a cube with an edge length of exactly                    one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with                    edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or                    any other substance.
amount of space occupied by an object.
A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10                    cm). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one                    cubic decimeter (dm3). A liter (L) is the more common name for the                    cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.
A cubic centimeter (cm3) is the volume of a cube with an edge length                    of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often                    used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is also called a milliliter                    (mL) and is 1/1000 of a liter.
Volume is a very common unit of measure used in chemistry. Below are images of                    common glassware used to measure volume.
We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its                         density                                                                                    ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object                                                                        . Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and                    length.
ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object
The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance                    to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter                        (kg/m3). For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient                    unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) or grams per milliliter (g/mL)                    for the                    densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. Although                    there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from                    about 0.7 g/cm3 (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm3 (the                    density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L. The table shows the                    densities of some common substances.
While there are many ways to determine the density of an object, perhaps the most                    straightforward method involves separately finding the mass and volume of the                    object, and then dividing the mass of the sample by its volume. In the following                    example, the mass is found directly by weighing, but the volume is found                    indirectly through length measurements.

Goldin bricks, bars, and coinshas been a form of currency for centuries.                        In order to swindle people into paying for a brick of gold without actually                        investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling the centers of                        hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire                        brick is gold. It does not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density                        is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm3. What is the density of lead if                        a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?
(We will discuss the reason for rounding to the first decimal place in the                        next section.)
What is the density of the rubber stopper seen in the image to the left if                        its mass is 10.32 g?
To determine the density of an irregularly shaped solid we can use the                        process of water displacement. The initial volume is recorded, in this                        example 30.0 mL. Then the object is carefully placed in the water and the                        new volume is recorded, in this example 35.6 mL. The difference between the                        initial volume and the final volume is the volume of the object.

20,598,600,91,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Quantum Numbers,"The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons inatoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theoryprovides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor tochemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energylevels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in anatom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values andcan jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or staybetween these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n =, 2, 3, . Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greaterfor greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum numberquantum number specifying the shell an electron occupies in an atom. The principlequantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially thesame concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for theprincipal quantum number is the shell number. The shellsset of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n of an atom can bethought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons thatbelong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the correspondingcircular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shellnumber, and so the higher the energy level. The positively charged protons inthe nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attractionbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of theelectrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater theenergy it has.

The principal quantum number, n, is one of three quantumnumbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbitalmathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables, which is distinctfrom an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is mostprobable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability offinding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and isbased on solutions of the Schrdinger equation. In addition, the principlequantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-likeatom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general regionin which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ionsare located. The values for n can be positive wholenumbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...

Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantumquantum number distinguishing the different shapes of orbitals; it is also a measure of the orbital angular momentumnumber. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on thevalues, l = 0, 1, 2, , n  1.This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only onevalue of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number definesthe general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape ofthe orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshellset of orbitals in an atom with the same values of n and l. In addition, thegreater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentumof an electron at this orbital.

Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitalsspherical region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 0. An electron in this orbital is called an s electron (or the ssubshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitalsdumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a p electron. The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitalsregion of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2. An electron in this orbital is called a d electron, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitalsmultilobed region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 3. An electron in this orbital is called an f electron for l =, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider.

The subshell which exist within the shells exhibit different shapes of electron densitya measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function . The value of the Magnetic Quantum Number, ml, indicates the region that an electron occupieswithin a subshell based on the shape of the subshell.
a measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function 
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical, as seen in the diagrambelow.
For the s subshell there is only one region, the sphere, in which an electroncan reside. Therefore in the s subshell there is only one value for ml, which is designated 0. Each region ofelectron density of a subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. Since the ssubshell only has one region of electron density the maximum number of electronsfor any s subshell is 2.
The shape of the p sublevel is more complex than the s sublevel, consisting of 3dumbbell-shaped orbitals originating from a center origin and along the x, y, and z axis as seen in the diagram below.
Within a p subshell electrons may reside in one of the three dumbbell-shapedregions. Therefore, within the p subshell there are three possible values forml, which are -1, 0, 1. Because there are three regions ofelectron density in a p subshell, a maximum of 6 electrons can occupy any psubshell.
The shape of the d subshell is even more complex as seen in the diagram below.Describing the exact shape of the regions of electron density is not importantfor our purposes, but you do need to recognize there are a total of five regionsof electron density within this subshell. Therefore for the d subshell, thereare five possible values for ml which are designated -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.The five regions of electron density, indicate that any d subshell can hold 10electrons.
As you might expect, the shapes of the regions of electron density are even morecomplex within the f subshell. Again, knowing the specific of the shapes is notimportant for our purposes, however you should recognize that there are sevenregions of electron density. Therefore there are seven possible values forml within the f subshell, which are designated -3, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A maximum of 14 electrons can occupy the seven regions ofelectron density in a f subshell.

If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is            higher than its initial temperature, Tfinal  Tinitial has a positive value, and the value of q is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its            temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, Tfinal  Tinitial            has a negative value, and the value of q is negative.
A flask containing 8.0  102 g of water is heated, and the temperature of                the water increases from 21 C to 85 C. How much heat did the water absorb?
To answer this question, consider these factors:
The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 C requires                4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 C, we                will need 800 times as much to heat 800 g of water by 1 C. Finally, we observe that                since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 C, we will need 64 times as                much to heat it by 64 C (that is, from 21 C to 85 C).
This can be summarized using the equation:

22,228,229,45,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Atomic Mass,"Because each proton and each neutron contributeapproximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron contributes far less,the atomic massaverage mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a wholenumber). However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.

He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively            charged alpha particlespositively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons (\xce particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of            radium; \xce particles consist of two protons and two neutrons. Rutherford and his            colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a            beam of \xce particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of            the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering            of the \xce particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an \xce            particle.
positively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons
What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being            deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were            deflected almost straight back toward the source.
Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving \xce particles passed            through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty            space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when            they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like            charges repel one another, the few positively charged \xce particles that changed paths            abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly            concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the            time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing            a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:
This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very            small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is            concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the atom is            electrically neutral. He named this fundamental particle the protonPositively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom., the positively            charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will            learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used            today.
Positively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom.
The image in the activity below represents a close-up diagram of Rutherford\'s gold                foil experiment. Drag the description of the observation that Rutherford made to the                place on the diagram that represents that observation.
One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom,            with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different            proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the            existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged            particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found            evidence of neutronsuncharged, subatomic particle located in the nucleus, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same            as that of protons.

24,837,840,116,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Partial Pressure of Gases,"Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases            do not affect each others pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same            pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container. The pressure            exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressurepressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture. This            observation is summarized by Daltons law of partial pressures.
pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture
The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial                pressures of the component gases:
P_{Total} = P_A + P_B + P_C + ... = \\Sigma_iP_i 
In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases,                    PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial                pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its            mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component            of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:
P_A = X_A \imes P_{Total} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{where}\\ X_A =                \\frac{n_A}{n_{Total}}
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole            fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the            number of moles of all components in the mixture.
A 10.0L vessel contains 2.50 -3 mol of H2, 1.00 -3 mol                of He, and 3.00 -4 mol of Ne at 35 C.
(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?
(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?

The total pressure is given by the sum of the partial pressures:
P_T = P_{H_2} + P_{H_e} + P_{N_e} = (0.00632 + 0.00253 + 0.00076)                    \\mathrm{atm} = 9.61 \imes 10^{-3} \\mathrm{atm}
Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.
A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41                mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.
(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?
(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?
The mole fraction is given by XA = nA/nTotal and the                partial pressure is PA = XA  PTotal.
For O2,

25,484,486,78,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Calculating Formal Charge,"Previously, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. However, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal chargescharge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons) to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.
charge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons)
The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.
Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:
Formal Charge
We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.

26,1121,1125,160,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two                    separate atomic orbitals on different atoms that creates a region with one pair                    of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along an                    axis containing the nuclei, they form a  bond. When they overlap in a fashion                    that creates a node along this axis, they form a  bond.
We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of                    the valence atomic orbitals, to describe the electron density around covalently                    bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma () bonds directed toward                    other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine                    the type of hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions                    of electron density about it. Two such regions imply sp hybridization; three,                        sp2 hybridization; four, sp3 hybridization; five, sp3d                    hybridization; and six, sp3d2 hybridization. Pi () bonds                    are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals).
Multiple bonds consist of a  bond located along the axis between two atoms and                    one or two  bonds. The  bonds are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized                    atomic orbitals, while the  bonds are formed by the side-by-side overlap of                    unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized                    orbitals with the appropriate alignment to overlap, so the placement of  bonds                    can vary.

27,1116,1120,158,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Bonding in Diatomic Molecules,"A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the                    atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine, the electrons occupy the molecular                    orbital of lowest energy, the s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule,                        H2, readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule                    is lower than that of two H atoms. The s orbital that contains both                    electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.
A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the                        H2 molecule are in the s bonding orbital; the electron                    configuration is (s)2. We represent this configuration                    by a molecular orbital energy diagram seen below in which a single upward arrow                    indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows                    indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons                    so we have
Because the bond order for the HH bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single                    bond.
A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium                    atoms do not combine to form a dihelium molecule, He2, with four                    electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the                    lower-energy bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the                    two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding molecular orbital. We would write                    the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as                        (s)2(s)2 as seen in the                    diagram below The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force                    for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule. In fact, helium exists as                    discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a                    hypothetical dihelium molecule would be zero.
A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.
Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the                    second period of the periodic table: Li2, Be2,                        B2, C2, N2, O2, F2,                    and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the                        Ne2 molecule would not be stable. We can see this by a                    consideration of the molecular electron configurations in the table below.
We predict ground state valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict                    electron configurations of atoms. Valence electrons are assigned to valence                    molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hunds                    rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons                    fill each orbital of that type singly before any pairing of electrons takes                    place.
As we saw in valence bond theory,  bonds are generally more stable than  bonds                    formed from degenerate atomic orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory,                     orbitals are usually more stable than  orbitals. However, this is not always                    the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in                    below. Looking at Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is                    consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section. However, for                    atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe                    a different pattern, in which the p orbital is higher in energy than                    the p set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear                    diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral                    molecule.
This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing.                    s-p mixing does not create new orbitals; it merely influences the energies of                    the existing molecular orbitals. The s wavefunction mathematically combines                    with the p wavefunction, with the result that the s orbital becomes                    more stable, and the p orbital becomes less stable, as seen int the                    energy diagram below. Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p                    mixing, with the \\(\\sigma_s^\\ast\\) becoming more stable and the \\(\\sigma_p^\\ast\\)                    becoming less stable.
s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. The energy                    difference between 2s and 2p orbitals in O, F, and Ne is greater than that in                    Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and                        Ne2 exhibit negligible s-p mixing (not sufficient to change the                    energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown                    above. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which                    leads to the pattern where the p orbital is raised above the                        p set.
Using the MO diagrams shown, we can add in the electrons and determine the                    molecular electron configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic                    molecules. As shown in the table above, Be2 and Ne2                    molecules would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.
The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li2,                    is analogous to the formation of H2, but the atomic orbitals involved                    are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence                    electron. Hence, we have two valence electrons available for the s                    bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would be in a bonding                    orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule                    is, in fact, present in appreciable concentration in lithium vapor at                    temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules                    in the table above with a bond order greater than zero are also known.
The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the                        (py,pz) level. We expect the two electrons that                    occupy these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular                    electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the fact that the                    oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons, as seen in the energy diagram in the                    example below. The presence of two unpaired electrons has proved to be difficult                    to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it                    quite well. In fact, the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a                    strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.
Draw the molecular orbital diagram for the oxygen molecule, O2.                        From this diagram, calculate the bond order for O2. How does this                        diagram account for the paramagnetism of O2?
We draw a molecular orbital energy diagram. Each oxygen atom contributes six                        electrons, so the diagram appears as shown below.
We calculate the bond order as
Oxygen\'s paramagnetism is explained by the presence of two unpaired electrons                        in the (py, pz)* molecular orbitals.
Give the molecular orbital configuration for the valence electrons in                            C22. Will this ion be stable?
Looking at the appropriate MO diagram, we see that the  orbitals are lower                        in energy than the p orbital. The valence electron configuration                        for C2 is                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4.                        Adding two more electrons to generate the C22 anion will give a                        valence electron configuration of                            (s)2(s)2(py,pz)4(px)2.                        Since this has six more bonding electrons than antibonding, the bond order                        will be 3, and the ion should be stable.

28,172,172,35,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Ionic Bond Formation,"Chemical bonding is the force of attraction that holds two or more atoms                    together. Chemical bonding is the result of atoms gaining, losing, or sharing                    valence electrons. Ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound form from the transfer of electrons from one atom                    to another to form positively and negatively charged ions. Covalent bondsbond formed when electrons are shared between atoms form                    when two or more atoms share electrons. But why do atoms have this tendency to                    gain, lose, or share electrons to form compounds? The answer has to do with the                    stability of electron configurations. The most stable arrangement of electrons                    is when the outer shell is full. With the exception of the  first shell which                    is full with two electrons, all of the other shells are full with eight                    electrons. It is important to recognize that when the outer shell is full this                    corresponds to the electron configuration of a noble gas. From this general                    observation comes a very important concept of chemical bonding the Octet Ruleguideline that states main group atoms will form structures in which eight valence electrons interact with each nucleus, counting bonding electrons as interacting with both atoms connected by the bond.                    Main group elements will gain, lose, or share electrons in order to obtain the                    electron configuration of a noble gas.

Previously, we discussed the basic concepts of ionic and covalent bonding. In                    this unit, we will look at chemical bonding in more detail, beginning here with                    ionic bonding.
As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A                    cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons                    from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom                    gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.
Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their                    constituent ions are held together by ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound: electrostatic forces of                    attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of                    ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids                    exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend                    to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are                    very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same                    reasonthe strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid                    state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or                    melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because                    the ions can move about freely.
electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound
Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical                    properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that                    burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form                    chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to                    most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction                    between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline compound                    sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride                    anions. The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely                    different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is                    poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react                    vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.
Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms                    the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a                    binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in                    terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have                    relatively low ionization energies and lose electrons easily. The lower the IE                    the more easily the atom loses electrons and the more chemically reactive. The                    most chemically reactive metals are in the lower left of the periodic table.                    Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain                    electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. The most                    chemically reactive nonmetals are found in the upper-right corner of the                    periodic table not including the noble gases. The noble gases have very high                    ionization energies and very low electron affinities. With only a few                    exceptions, the noble gases do not form chemical bonds and are extremely                    unreactive.
As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive                    charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of                    negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the                    simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of                    positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide,                        Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound contains two                    aluminum cations, Al3+, for every three oxide anions, O2                    [thus, (2  +3) + (3  ) = 0].
It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not                    represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a                    sodium chloride (NaCl) cmoleculed because there is not a single ionic bond, per                    se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces                    between ions are isotropicthe same in all directionsmeaning that any                    particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite                    charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound,                    three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a                    regular arrangement of equal numbers of Na+ cations and                        Cl anions.

29,1457,1462,220,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions,"The ions that we have discussed so far are called monatomic ions, that is, they are ions            formed from only one atom. We also find many polyatomic ionsions composed of more than one atom. These ions, which act as            discrete units, are electrically charged molecules (a group of bonded atoms with an            overall charge). Some of the more important polyatomic ions are listed in Table.            Oxyanions are polyatomic ions that contain one or more oxygen atoms. At this point in            your study of chemistry, you should memorize the names, formulas, and charges of the            most common polyatomic ions. Because you will use them repeatedly, they will soon become            familiar.
ions composed of more than one atom
Note that there is a system for naming some polyatomic ions; -ate and -ite are suffixes            designating polyatomic ions containing more or fewer oxygen atoms. Per- (short for            chyperd) and hypo- (meaning cunderd) are prefixes meaning more oxygen atoms than -ate            and fewer oxygen atoms than -ite, respectively. For example, perchlorate is                ClO4, chlorate is ClO3, chlorite is                ClO2 and hypochlorite is ClO. Unfortunately, the            number of oxygen atoms corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for            example, nitrate is NO3 while sulfate is SO42.
Many ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions as the cation, the anion, or both. As with            simple ionic compounds, these compounds must also be electrically neutral, so their            formulas can be predicted by treating the polyatomic ions as discrete units. We use            parentheses in a formula to indicate a group of atoms that behave as a unit. For            example, the formula for calcium phosphate, one of the minerals in our bones, is                Ca3(PO4)2. This formula indicates that there are            three calcium ions (Ca2+) for every two phosphate                (PO43) groups. The PO43 groups are            discrete units, each consisting of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms, and having            an overall charge of 3. The compound is electrically neutral, and its formula shows a            total count of three Ca, two P, and eight O atoms.
We can apply the same steps as we saw earlier with addition of parenthesis where            necessary.
Write the chemical formula for calcium nitrate.
The 2 becomes the subscript for the nitrate ion and the 1 becomes the subscript for                the calcium ion.
Ca(NO3)2
Notice we use parenthesis around the NO3. To represent more than one of                the same polyatomic ion in a formula, you must use parenthesis.
Write the chemical formula for ammonium carbonate.
(NH4)2CO3
We can also apply the general steps for naming ionic compounds to compounds with                    polyatomic ions.
It is helpful to note that there are not many positive polyatomic ions. You\'ll                    notice the only one on the list above is ammonium (NH4+). When                    identifying the cation and anion in an ionic compound in most cases, with the                    exception of compounds containing ammonium, the first element is the cation and                    the rest of the formula represents the anion.
We see in the example above the cation is potassium and the rest of the formula                        C2H3O2 is the anion acetate. Giving the                    name: potassium acetate
In this example the cation is barium and the rest of the formula                        Cr2O7 is the anion dichromate. Giving the name: Barium dichromate

30,1255,1260,182,Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:
\\mathrm{Au}^{3+}+3\\mathrm            e^-\\longrightarrow\\mathrm{Au}
Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems","(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium.

31,846,849,117,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Percent Yield,"The amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as            calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriately balanced chemical equation, is            called the theoretical yieldamount of product that may be produced from a given amount of reactant(s) according to the reaction stoichiometry of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product            obtained is called the actual yieldamount of product formed in a reaction, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for            a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by            side reactions that generate other products. Some products are difficult to collect            without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The            extent to which a reactions theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its            percent yieldmeasure of the efficiency of a reaction, expressed as a percentage of the theoretical yield.

If we slowly push in                    the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is                    compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the                    plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the                    effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in                    general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure,                    and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume                    increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and                    vice versa.

Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed below.
Unlike the PT and VT relationships, pressure and volume are not directly                    proportional to each other. Instead, P and V exhibit inverse proportionality.
The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at                    constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher                    Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now known as                    Boyles lawvolume of a given number of moles of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured: The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is                    inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured.
volume of a given number of moles of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured
Boyle\'s law states that the volume of a given amount of gas held at                            constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under                            which it is measured. Mathematically this can be represented as:
Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when                    plotting the inverse of the pressure (1/P) versus the volume (V), or the inverse                    of volume (1/V) versus the pressure (P). Graphs with curved lines are                    difficult to read accurately at low or high values of the variables, and they                    are more difficult to use in fitting theoretical equations and parameters to                    experimental data. For those reasons, scientists often try to find a way to                    clinearized their data. If we plot P versus V, we obtain a hyperbola as seen                    below.
The sample of gas has a volume of 15.0 mL at a pressure of 0.884 atm.                        Determine the pressure of the gas at a volume of 7.5 mL.
Because we are looking for the pressure change caused by a volume change at                        constant temperature, we will use Boyle\'s law equation.

33,1067,1071,151,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Titration,"In the 18th century, the concentration of vinegarsamples was determined by noting the amount of potassium carbonate, K2CO3 , which had to be added, a little at a time, before bubbling ceased.The greater the weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where thebubbling ended, the more concentrated the vinegar.
We now know that the effervescence that occurredduring this process was due to reaction with acetic acid, CH3CO2H, the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste ofvinegar. Acetic acid reacts with potassium carbonate according to the followingequation:
The bubbling was due to the production of CO2 gas.
The test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is onetype of quantitative analysisthe determination of the amount or concentration of asubstance in a sample. In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute(acetic acid) was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solutepresent in a known volume of the solution. In other types of chemical analyses, theamount of a substance present in a sample is determined by measuring the amount ofproduct that results.
The described approach to measuring vinegarstrength was an early version of the analytical technique known as titrationanalysisquantitative chemical analysis method that involves measuring the volume of a reactant solution required to completely react with the analyte in a sample. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buretdevice used for the precise delivery of variable liquid volumes, such as in a titration analysis to makeincremental additions of a solution containing a known concentration of somesubstance (the titrantsolution containing a known concentration of substance that will react with the analyte in a titration analysis) to a sample solution containing the substance whoseconcentration is to be measured (the analytechemical species of interest). The titrant and analyte undergo achemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrantsolution required for complete reaction with the analyte (the equivalence pointvolume of titrant solution required to react completely with the analyte in a titration analysis; provides a stoichiometric amount of titrant for the samples analyte according to the titration reactionof the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration.

The equivalence point of a titration may bedetected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solutionaccompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in theclassic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, specialdyes called indicatorssubstances added to the sample in a titration analysis to permit visual detection of the end point are added to the sample solutions to impart a change incolor at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence pointsmay also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in apredictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approachtaken to detect a titrations equivalence point, the volume of titrant actuallymeasured is called the end point. Properly designed titration methods typicallyensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible.Though any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titrationanalysis, the three described in this unit (precipitation, acid-base, and redox)are most common.

34,489,491,78,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Calculating Formal Charge,"Previously, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. However, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal chargescharge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons) to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.
charge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons)
The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.
Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:
Formal Charge
We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.

35,1240,1245,180,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,X-Ray Crystallography,"The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of            atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by            the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of            travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier            whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are            electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between            neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few angstroms (1  = 1             10 m)).
When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a            crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When            scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo            interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a            decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining            waves maxima are separated as shown below.
Light waves occupying the same space                experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b)                intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and                minima.
When X-rays of a certain wavelength, \xce\xbb, are            scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, d, they may            undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by            the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength.            This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, \xce, is related to the            wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:
n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta
This relation is known as the Bragg equation in            honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. The            illustration below shows two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal            planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in            constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different            angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive            interference.
The diffraction of X-rays scattered by                the atoms within a crystal permits the determination of the distance between the                atoms. The top image depicts constructive interference between two scattered                waves and a resultant diffracted wave of high intensity. The bottom image                depicts destructive interference and a low intensity diffracted                wave.
An X-ray diffractometer, such as the one            illustrated below, may be used to measure the angles at which X-rays are diffracted when            interacting with a crystal as described earlier. From such measurements, the Bragg            equation may be used to compute distances between atoms as demonstrated in the following            example exercise.
(a) In a diffractometer, a beam of                X-rays strikes a crystalline material, producing (b) an X-ray diffraction                pattern that can be analyzed to determine the crystal structure.
In a diffractometer, X-rays with a wavelength                of 0.1315 nm were used to produce a diffraction pattern for copper. The first order                diffraction (n = 1) occurred at an angle \xce = 25.25. Determine the spacing between                the diffracting planes in copper.
The distance between the planes is found by                solving the Bragg equation, \\(n\\lambda=2d\\cdot\\sin\heta\\), for d.

Heattransfer of thermal energy between two bodies (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at            different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases            the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we            initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low            temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a            higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L,            the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The            temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the            temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules.            Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature.

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A            change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion            reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that releases heatthis            process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torchs flame. A            reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that absorbs heat. A cold pack used to            treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances            in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the            resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

If we put the balloon in a                    refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both                    the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very                    cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.
These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a                    confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as                    the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.                    Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed                    and graphed.
The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at                    constant pressure is known as Charless law in recognition of the French                    scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre Csar Charles.
Charless law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly                            proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is                            held constant.

Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at                constant pressure, this is a job for Charless law.

For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atomscomposing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may becorrectly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic andnow primarily used in the production of the canti-stickd polymer, Teflon. Themolecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains onecarbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecularmass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the averageatomic masses of these atoms.

The formula mass for an ionic compoundis calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compounds formula.Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not representthe composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred toas the cmolecular mass.d

The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its            mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component            of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:
P_A = X_A \imes P_{Total} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{where}\\ X_A =                \\frac{n_A}{n_{Total}}
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole            fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the            number of moles of all components in the mixture.
A 10.0L vessel contains 2.50 -3 mol of H2, 1.00 -3 mol                of He, and 3.00 -4 mol of Ne at 35 C.
(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?
(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?
The gases behave independently, so the partial pressure of each gas can be determined                from the ideal gas equation, using:
P = \\frac{nRT}V.
\equire{cancel} P_{H_2} = \\frac{(2.50 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 6.32 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\mathrm{atm}
\equire{cancel} P_{H_e} = \\frac{(1.00 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 2.53 \imes 10^{-3}                    \\mathrm{atm}
\equire{cancel} P_{N_e} = \\frac{(3.00 \imes 10^{-4}                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{atm}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(308                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{10.0 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 7.58 \imes 10^{-4}                    \\mathrm{atm}
The total pressure is given by the sum of the partial pressures:
P_T = P_{H_2} + P_{H_e} + P_{N_e} = (0.00632 + 0.00253 + 0.00076)                    \\mathrm{atm} = 9.61 \imes 10^{-3} \\mathrm{atm}
Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.
A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41                mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.
(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?
(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?
The mole fraction is given by XA = nA/nTotal and the                partial pressure is PA = XA  PTotal.
For O2,
X_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{2.83 \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41)                    \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.252
and
P_{O_2} = X_{O_2} \imes P_{Total} = 0.252 \imes 192 \\mathrm{kPa} = 48.4                    \\mathrm{kPa}
For N2O,
X_{N_2O} = \\frac{n_{N_2O}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{8.41                    \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41) \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.748
and
P_{N_2O} = X_{N_2O} \imes P_{Total} = 0.748 \imes 192 \\mathrm{kPa} =                    143.6 \\mathrm{kPa}

40,1327,1332,193,Gases,Gas Laws,The Ideal Gas Law,"To this point, four separate laws have beendiscussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of thegas:
Combining these four laws yields the ideal gaslaw.
The ideal gas lawrelation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws shows the relation between the pressure, volume, temperature,and number of moles of a gas:
relation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles ofthe gas, T is its temperature on the kelvin scale, andR is a constant called the ideal gas constant or theuniversal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, andtemperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required bydimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atmmol  K  and 8.314 kPa L mol  K .
Gases whose properties of P , V , and T are accuratelydescribed by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit idealbehavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypotheticalconstruct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explainthe gas laws as will be described later in this unit. Although all the calculationspresented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable forgases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the finalmodule of this unit, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for thenon-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and lowtemperatures.
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, theideal gas constantconstant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K, R , and the variable properties P , V , n , andT . Specifying any four of these terms will permit use ofthe ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following examples.
constant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K
If the number of moles of an ideal gas are kept constant under two different setsof conditions, a useful mathematical relationship called the combined gas law isobtained:
using units of atm, L, and K. Both sets of conditions are equal to the productof n  R (where n = the number of moles of the gas and R is the idealgas law constant).
When filled with air, a typical scuba tank witha volume of 13.2 L has a pressure of 153 atm. If the water temperature is 27 C, howmany liters of air will such a tank provide to a divers lungs at a depth ofapproximately 70 feet in the ocean where the pressure is 3.13 atm?
Letting 1 represent the air in the scuba tankand 2 represent the air in the lungs, and noting that body temperature (thetemperature the air will be in the lungs) is 37 C, we can identify thevariables as:

41,155,155,33,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,How to Use the OLI Course,"This course is thoughtfully designed (relying heavily on research-based principles of            learning science) to guide you through your learning of General                 Chemistry. Understanding how and why the course is set-up as it is will help you better            utilize all aspects of the course and allow you to more successfully and efficiently learn            the concepts.
One of the first things you will notice as you begin is that at the top of every                    core content page there are one or more learning objectives.
Learning Objectives appear at the top of the page to guide your learning.
These learning objectives are intended to guide you as to what you should be                    accomplishing on that page(s). It is a good idea to make a mental note of, or even write                    down, these learning objectives and reflect on them as you are going through the                    content. Ask yourself, ""Am I achieving this objective?""
There are many activities throughout this course. The activities are                    designed to more fully engage you in the learning process. You will notice there                    are two categories of activities within the modules: Learn By                        Doing and Did I Get This. These types of                    activities are designed in different ways, each for a unique purpose.
The Learn By Doing activities are designed to                            scaffold your learning. They provide significantly more guidance than                            the Did I Get This activities in a number of                            ways. One of the more obvious methods of guidance is hints. You will                            notice that many of these activities have hints. If you are unsure how                            to approach a problem, ask for a hint to guide you. Note that some                            problems have multiple hints.
Learn By Doing activities scaffold practice. Ask for a hint if you are unsure how to progress.
An additional way you will see that Learn By                            Doing activities help to scaffold learning is to present                            problems in a step-by-step manner. Learn By                                Doing activities are usually presented before Did I Get This activities.
Some Learn By Doing activities present problem solving in a                                 step-by-step manner                                 to scaffold practice.                                
The Did I Get This activities are designed to be                            a self-assessment. Problems generally do not include hints and are                            generally not presented in a step-wise manner. This is your opportunity                            to determine after reading through the material and performing the                            numerous activities that preceded, whether or not you ""got"" the concept.                            In the event that you feel that you have not ""gotten"" the concept, it is                            a good idea to go back and review the previous material and/or seek help                            from your instructor.
Did I get this activities allow you to self-assess your understanding before a graded assignment. 
My Response activity links are at the end of each                            module. These activities allow you to reflect on how well you learned                            the concepts presented. Reflecting on your own learning, also know as                            metacognition, is a proven way to promote the                            development of effective learning.
You also have the opportunity to include questions you might have for                            your instructor. Your responses are sent to your instructor and may be                            used in classroom discussions.
Click on the My Response link to reflect on your understanding and provide feedback to your instructor. 
There is a Checkpoint at the end of each module and unit.                                                         This is a graded assignment and the score will be reported to your                            instructor. Your instructor may decide to assign points to your overall grade in                            the course for these assignments.
There are many numeric input problems within this course. For any of                            these you may use standard notation or scientific notation. It is highly                            recommended for very small or very large values that you use scientific                            notation.
For exponents, use the letter e. For example, for 6.022                            enter 6.022e23.

42,1060,1064,149,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Module Summary and Quiz,"VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that                    minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone                    pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a                    molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only                    when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment                    measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is                    determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a                    molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond                    moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar                    molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric                    fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.
Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the                    learning objectives for the Ionic and Covalent Bonding module and use the                    My Response link below to ask any questions you might have about                    the material that you would like the instructor to address. Your questions can                    be for clarification of the material or further insight. Your self-evaluation                    and questions may also shape the discussions in class.
Your responses will not be graded, but will be available for your instructor.

43,1409,1414,210,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Binary Ionic Compounds,"In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the            total number of negative charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically            neutral overall, even though they contain positive and negative ions. We can use this            observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic            compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative            charges are equal.
A binary ionic compoundIonic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion. consists of a monatomic (formed from one atom) cation and a            monatomic anion. Note that the ending of the names of monatomic anions are changed to            -ide. For example, sulfide is an ion of sulfur and phosphide is an ion of            phosphorus.
Ionic compound consisting of a monatomic cation and a monatomic anion.
Write the chemical formula for potassium sulfide.
Referring to the periodic table, we see that                        potassium will form a 1+ ion and sulfur will form a 2- ion, as illustrated                        in the diagrams below.
In order to obtain a                        neutral compound 2 potassium ions must combine with 1 sulfur ion.
A convenient method to write chemical formulas is by using the criss-cross                    method. In this method the value of the ionic charge for the cation becomes the                    subscript of the anion in the chemical formula and the value of the ionic charge                    of the anion becomes the subscript of the cation in the chemical formula.                    Looking at the previous example we can see how the criss-cross method works.
Like the previous method, the result is K2S. One thing to remember with the                    criss-cross method is that the ratio of ions in a chemical formula of an ionic                    compound must always be in the smallest whole number ratio.
Write the chemical formula for magnesium oxide.
Notice the result of the criss-cross method results in:
This 2:2 ratio of ions is reduced to 1:1, resulting in the formula:
Given the name of a binary ionic compound you can derive the formula and given                    the formula you can name the compound.
Name the compound Li3P.
In all of the examples we have looked at so far the cation in the formula can only                    form one ion. For example, when the calcium atom forms an ion, it is always                        Ca2+ or when potassium forms an ion it is always K+.                    However some of the transition metals can form different ions. For example lead                    can form ion Pb2+ and Pb4+. So when it combines with                    chlorine the result may be PbCl2 or PbCl4. When we write                    the name for each of these formulas we need to indicate whether the compound is                    formed from the Pb2+ and Pb4+ ion. We do this using roman                    numerals. Where the roman numeral indicates the charge of the ion in the                    formula.
Note that not all transition metals can form multiple cations. Here is a list of                    the most common.
Chromium(III)
Cr3+
Manganese(III)
Mn3+
Iron(III)
Fe3+
Cobalt(III)
Co3+
Copper(II)
Cu2+
Mercury(II)
Hg2+
Tin(IV)
Sn4+
Lead(IV)
Pb4+
It is also worth noting that the following metals always form the same ion.                    Silver always forms Ag+. Cadmium always forms Cd2+. Zinc always forms Zn2+.                    Gallium always forms Ga3+. Aluminum always forms Al3+.

We describe an electron configuration with a symbol that containsthree pieces of information:
electronic structure of an atom in its ground state given as a listing ofthe orbitals occupied by the electrons
For example, the notation 2p4 (read ""twopfour"") indicates four electrons ina p subshelldumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describesorbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a pelectron (l = 1) with a principal quantum number (n) of 2. The notation 3d8(read ""threedeight"") indicates eight electrons in the d subshell (i.e., l = 2) of theprincipal shell for which n = 3.
dumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describesorbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a pelectron
To determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can cbuilddthe structures in the order of atomic numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, andcontinuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a timeto the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have describedthe electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principleprocedure in which the electron configuration of the elements isdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, addingone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the propersubshell at a time, from the German word Aufbau (cto build upd). Each added electronoccupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in thediagram below), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantumnumbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enterhigher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled tocapacity.
procedure in which the electron configuration of the elements isdetermined by cbuildingd them in order of atomic numbers, addingone proton to the nucleus and one electron to the propersubshell at a time
Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electronconfigurations, the figure below provides an alternative method for determiningthe electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen andincludes each subshell as you proceed in increasing Z order. For example, afterfilling the 3p block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followedby the 3d orbitals.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the electron configurationof an element from the periodic table.
The alkali metal sodium (atomic number 11) has one more electron than the neonatom. This electron must go into the lowest-energy subshell available, the 3sorbital, giving a 1s22s22p63s1configuration. The electrons occupying the inner shell orbitals are called core electronselectron in an atom that occupies the orbitals of the innershells. Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electronconfigurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noblegas that matches the core electron configuration, and then writing the rest ofthe electron configuration that represents the outer-shell electrons. Theouter-shell electrons are very significant in that they contain the valence electronselectrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts of the atom. The valence electrons are those electrons in the outermostshell orbitals of the atom. It is these electrons that heavily contribute to anelement\'s properties and they are the electrons involved in chemical bonding.Valance electrons will be discussed in more detail later in this course. For oursodium example, the symbol [Ne] represents core electrons,(1s22s22p6) and our abbreviated orcondensed configuration is [Ne]3s1.

electrons in the outermost or valence shell (highest value of n)of a ground-state atom; determine how an element reacts
Similarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as[He]2s1, where [He] represents the configuration of the heliumatom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writingthe configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurationsof lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which are in the alkali metal family, haveonly one electron in a valence s subshell outside a filled set of innershells.
Li: [He]2s1
Na: [Ne]3s1
The alkaline earth metal magnesium (atomic number 12), with its 12 electrons in a[Ne]3s2 configuration, is analogous to its family memberberyllium, [He]2s2. Both atoms have a filled s subshell outside theirfilled inner shells. Aluminum (atomic number 13), with 13 electrons and theelectron configuration [Ne]3s23p1, is analogous to itsfamily member boron, [He]2s22p1.
The electron configurations of silicon (14 electrons), phosphorus (15 electrons),sulfur (16 electrons), chlorine (17 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) areanalogous in the electron configurations of their outer shells to theircorresponding family members carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon,respectively, except that the principal quantum number of the outer shell of theheavier elements has increased by one to n = 3. Figure shows the lowest energy,or ground-state, electron configuration for these elements as well as that foratoms of each of the known elements.
When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metalpotassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to addelectrons to the 3d subshell. However, all available chemical and physicalevidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the nextelectron is not added to the 3d level but is, instead, added to the 4s level.The 3d orbital with no radial nodes and is higher in energy because it is lesspenetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s, which has threeradial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of[Ar]4s1. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valenceshell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s subshell andcalcium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s2. This gives calciuman outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium andmagnesium.
Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additionalelectrons are added successively to the 3d subshell. This subshell is filled toits capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for l = 2 [d orbitals], there arel + 1 = 5 values of ml, meaning that there are five d orbitals thathave a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4p subshell fills next. Note thatfor three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y)through silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 delectrons are successively added to the (n  1) shell next to the n shell tobring that (n  1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La)through lutetium (Lu) and actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr), 14 f electrons(l = 3, 2l + 1 = 7 mlvalues; thus, seven orbitals with a combinedcapacity of 14 electrons) are successively added to the (n  2) shell to bringthat shell from 18 electrons to a total of 32 electrons.
The interactive example below shows how to determine the abbreviated electronconfiguration from the periodic table.
Thus far, we have looked at electron configurations for ground state atoms.Electron configurations for excited atoms can also be represented. If theelectron configuration represents an excited atom, it will not follow thesequence we have looked at for ground state atoms.

45,1257,1262,182,Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:
\\mathrm{Au}^{3+}+3\\mathrm            e^-\\longrightarrow\\mathrm{Au}
Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems","The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.).

A physical propertyA characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. is a characteristic of matter that                     is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples                     of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling                     points, and electrical conductivity. We can observe some physical properties,                     such as density and color, without changing the physical state of the matter                     observed. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron                     or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes                     a physical change. A physical changeA change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition. is a change in the state or properties                     of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition (the                     identities of the substances contained in the matter). We observe a physical                     change when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses                     into liquid water. Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and                     demagnetizing metals (as is done with common anti-theft security tags) and                     grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes                     in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state,                     form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.
A characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition.

                    The change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change) is                     a chemical propertyThe change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change).. Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity,                    acidity, reactivity (many types), and heat of combustion. Iron, for example, combines                     with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize.                     Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no                     hazard because it is very unreactive.
The change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change).
To identify a chemical property, we look for a chemical change. A chemical changeA change in matter that always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change. always                     produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change.                     The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than                     the iron, oxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin                     is a chemical change because the gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the                     original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions that are performed                     in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and                     food being cooked, digested, or rotting.

Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two            types: (i)                potential energy                                                            energy of a particle or system of particles derived from relative                            position, composition, or condition                                                , the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or            condition, and (ii)                kinetic energy                                                            energy of a moving body, in joules, equal to 1/2 mv2 (where                                m = mass and v =                            velocity)                                                , the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of            a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward            through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce            electricity in a hydroelectric plant. A battery has potential energy because the            chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.

Kinetic energy is dependent on an object\'s mass and velocity according to the                    following equation:
Where m is mass in kg and v is                    velocity in m/s. If mass,  m is in kg and velocity, v, is in m/s, then the kinetic energy has units of                    Joules (J = kg m2/s2).
Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before            a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This            observation is expressed in the                 law of conservation of energy                                                            during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor                            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.                                                : during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor            destroyed, although it can be changed in form.

As you are likely aware the assumption in the previous exercise, that no energy was lost            to friction, is not what occurs in the real world. As well as having kinetic and            potential energy, energy is being transferred from the skateboard to the surface of the            track in the form of thermal energy caused by the interaction between the wheels of the            skateboard and the surface of the track. Return to the skatepark simulation and choose            the ""Friction"" screen. Again click to show the bar graph. Drag the skater to the top of            the track and observe the changes in energy now that the thermal energy due to friction            is accounted for.
When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of            one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the            conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example,            chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose            gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a cars engine, the rapidly            expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type            of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders pistons.
For chemical reactions, mass and energy are conserved separately. The total mass present            before the reaction occurs is equal to the total mass present after the reaction occurs.            Likewise, the total energy present before the reaction occurs is equal to the total            energy present after the reaction occurs. However, for nuclear reactions, mass can be            converted into energy according to Einsteins formula (E = mc2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light). In nuclear reactions, the total mass            changes and this leads to changes in energy that are much larger (by factors of a            million or so) than chemical reactions. To encompass both chemical and nuclear changes,            we combine these laws into one statement: The total quantity of matter and energy in the            universe is fixed. For most of this course, we will considering only chemical reactions,            and so energy and mass are separately conserved.
The animations and activities that follow show how energy is transformed from one type to            another in certain processes. In considering systems such as these, kinetic energy is            often referred to as mechanical energy.",,Check to see if your calculations match the approximate values given for PE and KE in                the bar graph of the simulation.,What is the approximate values given for the two equations?,1,0,0.0,23.64301109313965
48,822,825,116,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Partial Pressure of Gases,"Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases            do not affect each others pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same            pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container. The pressure            exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressurepressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture. This            observation is summarized by Daltons law of partial pressures.
pressure exerted by an individual gas in a mixture
The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial                pressures of the component gases:
P_{Total} = P_A + P_B + P_C + ... = \\Sigma_iP_i 
In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases,                    PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial                pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its            mole fraction (X), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component            of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:
P_A = X_A \imes P_{Total} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{where}\\ X_A =                \\frac{n_A}{n_{Total}}
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole            fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is the            number of moles of all components in the mixture.
A 10.0L vessel contains 2.50 -3 mol of H2, 1.00 -3 mol                of He, and 3.00 -4 mol of Ne at 35 C.
(a) What are the partial pressures of each of the gases?
(b) What is the total pressure in atmospheres?

Here is another example of this concept, but dealing with mole fraction calculations.
A gas mixture used for anesthesia contains 2.83 mol oxygen, O2, and 8.41                mol nitrous oxide, N2O. The total pressure of the mixture is 192 kPa.
(a) What are the mole fractions of O2 and N2O?
(b) What are the partial pressures of O2 and N2O?
The mole fraction is given by XA = nA/nTotal and the                partial pressure is PA = XA  PTotal.
For O2,
X_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2}}{n_{Total}} = \\frac{2.83 \\mathrm{mol}}{(2.83+8.41)                    \\mathrm{mol}} = 0.252

For N2O,

49,1040,1044,146,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions,"A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that            only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are            capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide            elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove            metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of            how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable            membranes.
Consider the apparatus illustrated in the diagram below, in which samples of pure solvent            and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate.            Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the            concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these            molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a            faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of            solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of            solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.
When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown above, the volume of the            solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the            level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of            the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent            molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a            reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent            ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (\xce) of the solution.
The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T,                    according to the equation
where R is the universal gas constant.
If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in Figure, applying pressure            greater than the osmotic pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes            solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent. This technique of reverse            osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to            produce high-purity tap water for drinking.
What is the osmotic pressure (atm) of a 0.30 M solution of glucose in water that is                used for intravenous infusion at body temperature, 37 C?
We can find the osmotic pressure, \xce, using the formula \xce = MRT, where T is on the                Kelvin scale (310 K) and the value of R is expressed in appropriate units (0.08206 L                atm/mol K).
Examples of osmosis are evident in many biological systems because cells are surrounded            by semipermeable membranes. Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have            lost water can be made crisp again by placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot            or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated salt solution loses            water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect            animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are            injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions            an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body must have            the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood            serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient            quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood            cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called            hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the            cells lose water to the more concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a            process called crenation. These effects are illustrated below.

50,1046,1050,147,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Percent Composition,"In the previous section, we discussed the relationship between the bulk mass of a            substance and the number of atoms or molecules it contains (moles). Given the chemical            formula of the substance, we were able to determine the amount of the substance (moles)            from its mass, and vice versa. But what if the chemical formula of a substance is            unknown? In this section, we will explore how to apply these very same principles in            order to derive the chemical formulas of unknown substances from experimental mass            measurements.
The elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas            are the most succinct way of representing this elemental makeup. When a compounds            formula is unknown, measuring the mass of each of its constituent elements is often the            first step in the process of determining the formula experimentally. The results of            these measurements permit the calculation of the compounds                 percent composition                                                            percentage by mass of the various elements in a compound                                                , defined as the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. For            example, consider a gaseous compound composed solely of carbon and hydrogen. The percent            composition of this compound could be represented as follows:
percentage by mass of the various elements in a compound
If analysis of a 10.0-g sample of this gas showed it to contain 2.5 g H and 7.5 g C, the            percent composition would be calculated to be 25% H and 75% C:
Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and                nitrogen showed it to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent                composition of this compound?
To calculate percent composition, we divide the experimentally derived mass of each                element by the overall mass of the compound, and then convert to a percentage:
The analysis results indicate that the compound is 61.0% C, 15.4% H, and 23.7% N by                mass.
Percent composition is also useful for evaluating the relative abundance of a                    given element in different compounds of known formulas. As one example, consider                    the common nitrogen-containing fertilizers ammonia (NH3), ammonium                    nitrate (NH4NO3), and urea (CH4N2O).                    The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the                    mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern                    for consumers choosing among these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications,                    the percent composition of a compound is easily derived from its formula mass                    and the atomic masses of its constituent elements. A molecule of NH3 contains                    one N atom weighing 14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3  1.008                    amu) = 3.024 amu. The formula mass of ammonia is therefore (14.01 amu + 3.024                    amu) = 17.03 amu, and its percent composition is:
This same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen                    molecules, or a mole of molecules, etc. The latter amount is most convenient and                    would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic and formula                    masses, as demonstrated in the example. As long as we know the chemical formula of                    the substance in question, we can easily derive percent composition from the                    formula mass or molar mass.
Aspirin is a compound with the molecular formula                            C9H8O4. What is its percent                        composition?
To calculate the percent composition, we need to know the masses of C, H, and                        O in a known mass of C9H8O4. It is                        convenient to consider 1 mol of C9H8O4 and                        use its molar mass (180.159 g/mole, determined from the chemical formula) to                        calculate the percentages of each of its elements:

52,600,602,91,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Quantum Numbers,"The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons inatoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theoryprovides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor tochemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energylevels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in anatom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values andcan jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or staybetween these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n =, 2, 3, . Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greaterfor greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum numberquantum number specifying the shell an electron occupies in an atom. The principlequantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially thesame concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for theprincipal quantum number is the shell number. The shellsset of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n of an atom can bethought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons thatbelong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the correspondingcircular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shellnumber, and so the higher the energy level. The positively charged protons inthe nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attractionbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of theelectrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater theenergy it has.

The principal quantum number, n, is one of three quantumnumbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbitalmathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables, which is distinctfrom an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is mostprobable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability offinding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and isbased on solutions of the Schrdinger equation. In addition, the principlequantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-likeatom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general regionin which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ionsare located. The values for n can be positive wholenumbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...

Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantumquantum number distinguishing the different shapes of orbitals; it is also a measure of the orbital angular momentumnumber. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on thevalues, l = 0, 1, 2, , n  1.This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only onevalue of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number definesthe general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape ofthe orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshellset of orbitals in an atom with the same values of n and l. In addition, thegreater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentumof an electron at this orbital.

Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitalsspherical region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 0. An electron in this orbital is called an s electron (or the ssubshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitalsdumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a p electron. The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitalsregion of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2. An electron in this orbital is called a d electron, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitalsmultilobed region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 3. An electron in this orbital is called an f electron for l =, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider.

The subshell which exist within the shells exhibit different shapes of electron densitya measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function . The value of the Magnetic Quantum Number, ml, indicates the region that an electron occupieswithin a subshell based on the shape of the subshell.
a measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function 
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical, as seen in the diagrambelow.
For the s subshell there is only one region, the sphere, in which an electroncan reside. Therefore in the s subshell there is only one value for ml, which is designated 0. Each region ofelectron density of a subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. Since the ssubshell only has one region of electron density the maximum number of electronsfor any s subshell is 2.
The shape of the p sublevel is more complex than the s sublevel, consisting of 3dumbbell-shaped orbitals originating from a center origin and along the x, y, and z axis as seen in the diagram below.
Within a p subshell electrons may reside in one of the three dumbbell-shapedregions. Therefore, within the p subshell there are three possible values forml, which are -1, 0, 1. Because there are three regions ofelectron density in a p subshell, a maximum of 6 electrons can occupy any psubshell.
The shape of the d subshell is even more complex as seen in the diagram below.Describing the exact shape of the regions of electron density is not importantfor our purposes, but you do need to recognize there are a total of five regionsof electron density within this subshell. Therefore for the d subshell, thereare five possible values for ml which are designated -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.The five regions of electron density, indicate that any d subshell can hold 10electrons.
As you might expect, the shapes of the regions of electron density are even morecomplex within the f subshell. Again, knowing the specific of the shapes is notimportant for our purposes, however you should recognize that there are sevenregions of electron density. Therefore there are seven possible values forml within the f subshell, which are designated -3, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A maximum of 14 electrons can occupy the seven regions ofelectron density in a f subshell.

53,1064,1068,150,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Resonance,"Some molecules can have two possible structures with the atoms in the same positions and            have identical formal charges such as the nitrite ion seen below. The electrons involved            in the NO double bond, however, are in different positions:
If nitrite ions do indeed contain a single and a double bond, we would expect for the two            bond lengths to be different. A double bond between two atoms is shorter (and stronger)            than a single bond between the same two atoms. Experiments show, however, that both NO            bonds in NO2 have the same strength and length, and are identical            in all other properties.
It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for NO2 in            which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are equivalent. Instead, we use the concept            of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement of atoms can be            written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of            that shown by the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each            of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in NO2 is the average of a double            bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance formstwo or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons. The            actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is            called a resonance hybridaverage of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow            between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. Thus, the electronic            structure of the NO2 ion is shown as:
two or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons
average of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures
We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an            electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between            resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that            shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory,            used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and            resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described            it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with            both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a            resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros,            it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some            characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves            are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).
The carbonate anion, CO32, provides a second example of            resonance:
One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central            atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any            one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion.            Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual            arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures.            Again, experiments show that all three CO bonds are exactly the same.

54,988,992,135,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Units of Solution Concentration: Mass and Volume Percentage,"In the previous section, we introduced molarity, a very useful measurement unit for            evaluating the concentration of solutions. However, molarity is only one measure of            concentration. In this section, we will introduce some other units of concentration that            are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention.
Earlier, we introduced percent composition as a measure of the relative amount of                    a given element in a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the                    composition of mixtures, including solutions. The mass percentageratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage                       of a solution                    component is defined as the ratio of the components mass to the solutions                    mass, expressed as a percentage.
ratio of solute-to-solution mass expressed as a percentage
We are generally most interested in the mass percentages of solutes, but it is                    also possible to compute the mass percentage of solvent.
Mass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass,                    percent weight, weight/weight percent, and other variations on this theme. The                    most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the percent sign, %, although                    more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use                    of these more detailed symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with                    other types of percentages, such as volume percentages (to be discussed later in                    this section).
Mass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label                    of a typical liquid bleach bottle cites the concentration of its active                    ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being 7.4%. A 100.0g sample of                    bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.
A 5.0g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What                        is the percent by mass of glucose in spinal fluid?
Substituting the given masses into the equation defining mass percentage                        yields:
Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg,                        g, kg, oz, and so on), the same unit must be used for both the solute and                        the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio.                        In this case, we converted the units of solute in the numerator from mg to g                        to match the units in the denominator. We could just as easily have                        converted the denominator from g to mg instead. As long as identical mass                        units are used for both solute and solution, the computed mass percentage                        will be correct.
cConcentratedd hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is                        commonly used as a laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19                        g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of this solution?
In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage,                        we need to know the corresponding mass of the solution. Using the solution                        density given, we can convert the solutions volume to mass, and then use                        the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical                        approach is outlined in this flowchart:
For proper unit cancellation, the 0.500 L volume is converted into 500 mL,                        and the mass percentage is expressed as a ratio, 37.2g HCl/g solution:
Liquid volumes over a wide range of magnitudes are conveniently measured                            using common and relatively inexpensive laboratory equipment. The                            concentration of a solution formed by dissolving a liquid solute in a                            liquid solvent is therefore often expressed as a volume percentageratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage, %vol                            or (v/v)%.
ratio of solute-to-solution volume expressed as a percentage
Rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) is usually sold as a 70% vol aqueous                                solution. If the density of isopropyl alcohol is 0.785 g/mL, how                                many grams of isopropyl alcohol are present in a 355 mL bottle of                                rubbing alcohol?
Per the definition of volume percentage, the isopropanol volume is                                70% of the total solution volume. Multiplying the isopropanol volume                                by its density yields the requested mass:

55,1268,1273,182,Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:
\\mathrm{Au}^{3+}+3\\mathrm            e^-\\longrightarrow\\mathrm{Au}
Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems",gas,What is the term for the energy that is produced by the use of natural gas?,1,1,0.0,25.29591178894043

Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they                    take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also                    matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would stay collapsed rather                    than inflate when filled with gas.
Anything that occupies space and has mass.
Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on                    earth. A                         solid                                                                                    State of matter that has a definite shape and definite                                    volume.                                                                         is rigid and possesses a definite shape. A                         liquid                                                                                    State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.                                                                         flows and takes the shape of a container, except that it forms a flat                    or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity,                    liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes                    that are very nearly independent of pressure. A                         gas                                                                                    State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take                                    on the shape and volume of its container.                                                                         takes both the shape and volume of its container.

State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take                                    on the shape and volume of its container.
Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases                    at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small                    pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is                    composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of                    more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to                    behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny                    particles of water (liquid or solid).
A fourth state of matter, plasma                                                                        A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.                                                            , occurs naturally in the interiors of stars and                    other high temperature situations. Like gases, plasmas are less dense than                    liquids or solids and do not have a fixed shape or volume. But unlike gases,                    plasmas contain significant amounts of electrically charged particles that are                    able to move freely. Due to these mobile charged particles, plasmas are very                    conductive and highly responsive to external electric or magnetic fields. In                    addition to stars, plasmas are found in neon signs, plasma TVs, lightning and                    the plasma torch (shown in the image below being used to cut through metal).
A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.
The                         mass                                                                                    The measure of the amount of matter of an object.                                                                         of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to                    measure an objects mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the                    object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the                    car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is                    to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.
The measure of the amount of matter of an object.
Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing.                         Weight                                                                                    The force that gravity exerts on an object.                                                                         refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is                    directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes                    as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronauts mass does                    not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only                    one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moons gravity is only one-sixth                    that of the earths.

This can be seen in a lead-acid car battery:                    The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable                    of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and                    water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of                    matter.
There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.
Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter,                    convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled                    conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is                    produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and                    assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But                    because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted                    as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.

57,343,344,58,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,Introduction to Chemistry,"Chemistry is sometimes referred to as cthe central scienced due to its                    interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for                    areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).                    Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine,                    materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields.                  The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many                    aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines                    within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry.                    Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools                    that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the                    chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial                    to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living                    organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and                    nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce                    useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture,                    food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide                    sustenance in the form of food and drink to the worlds population. Medicine,                    pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that                    help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and                    atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand                    and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the                    universe in astronomy and cosmology.
What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and                    assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing,                    containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and                    other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you                    will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and                    structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their                    causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws                    involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning chemistry, the                    study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The practice                    of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens                    whenever someone is involved in changes in matter or in conditions that may lead                    to such changes.
Chemistry is the study of matter and energy and their changes. Chemists study and                    describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains:                    macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of                    considering and describing chemical behavior.
Macro is a Greek word that means clarge.d The macroscopic domain is familiar to                    us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed                    directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat                    and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday                    and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical                    properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability.
The microscopic domain of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination.                    Micro also comes from Greek and means csmall.d Some aspects of the microscopic                    domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite                    or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye,                    but when were suffering from a cold, were reminded of how real they are.
However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistrysuch as                    atoms and moleculesare too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and                    often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain                    include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of                    which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms                    in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual                    molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules                    into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms                    together are created.
The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent                    components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as                    those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are                    part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider                    calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important                    role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic                    domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the                    challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols                    can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and                    one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that                    must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.
A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous                    substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze                    to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher                    temperatures are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall                    into the microscopic domainwhat we cannot observe with the naked eye. The                    description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and                    the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these                    molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe                    water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the                    symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for gas, (s) for solid, and (l) for                    liquid are also symbolic.

58,1214,1219,176,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Oxidation-Reduction: Oxidation States,"Earths atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O2, a chemically            reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in            many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidationprocess in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons             was originally            used to describe chemical reactions involving O2, but its meaning has evolved            to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox)            reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of            this classification.
process in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield            ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium            chloride:
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to            represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a            half-reaction:
These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl2            molecule) gain electrons, the csd subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are            present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the            loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:
In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes reductionprocess in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons        . Viewed from            a more active perspective, sodium functions as a reducing agent(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized (reductant), since it            provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an            oxidizing agent(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes)            sodium.
process in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons
(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized
(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for            example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the            explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the            previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called            oxidation number has been defined. The oxidation numberthe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic (or oxidation statethe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic) of an            element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic.            The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a            molecule or ion.
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals                    the charge on the molecule or ion.
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first,                    followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the                    reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to                    emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.
Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all                the elements in the following species:
a) H2S
b) SO32
c) SO42-
The oxidation number for H is +1.
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the                charge on the molecule or ion.
Since the oxidation state of H is +1 and there are 2 hydrogen atoms in this compound,                in order to obtain an overall charge of zero, we assign  for the oxidation state                of the sulfur.
The oxidation number for each oxygen in this situation, as it is in most, is .
The overall charge of the monatomic ion is .
The oxidation number for each oxygen in this situation, as it is in most, is .

59,140,140,33,Foundations of Chemistry,Course Introduction,How to Use the OLI Course,"This course is thoughtfully designed (relying heavily on research-based principles of            learning science) to guide you through your learning of General                 Chemistry. Understanding how and why the course is set-up as it is will help you better            utilize all aspects of the course and allow you to more successfully and efficiently learn            the concepts.
One of the first things you will notice as you begin is that at the top of every                    core content page there are one or more learning objectives.
Learning Objectives appear at the top of the page to guide your learning.
These learning objectives are intended to guide you as to what you should be                    accomplishing on that page(s). It is a good idea to make a mental note of, or even write                    down, these learning objectives and reflect on them as you are going through the                    content. Ask yourself, ""Am I achieving this objective?""
There are many activities throughout this course. The activities are                    designed to more fully engage you in the learning process. You will notice there                    are two categories of activities within the modules: Learn By                        Doing and Did I Get This. These types of                    activities are designed in different ways, each for a unique purpose.
The Learn By Doing activities are designed to                            scaffold your learning. They provide significantly more guidance than                            the Did I Get This activities in a number of                            ways. One of the more obvious methods of guidance is hints. You will                            notice that many of these activities have hints. If you are unsure how                            to approach a problem, ask for a hint to guide you. Note that some                            problems have multiple hints.
Learn By Doing activities scaffold practice. Ask for a hint if you are unsure how to progress.
An additional way you will see that Learn By                            Doing activities help to scaffold learning is to present                            problems in a step-by-step manner. Learn By                                Doing activities are usually presented before Did I Get This activities.
Some Learn By Doing activities present problem solving in a                                 step-by-step manner                                 to scaffold practice.                                
The Did I Get This activities are designed to be                            a self-assessment. Problems generally do not include hints and are                            generally not presented in a step-wise manner. This is your opportunity                            to determine after reading through the material and performing the                            numerous activities that preceded, whether or not you ""got"" the concept.                            In the event that you feel that you have not ""gotten"" the concept, it is                            a good idea to go back and review the previous material and/or seek help                            from your instructor.
Did I get this activities allow you to self-assess your understanding before a graded assignment. 
My Response activity links are at the end of each                            module. These activities allow you to reflect on how well you learned                            the concepts presented. Reflecting on your own learning, also know as                            metacognition, is a proven way to promote the                            development of effective learning.
You also have the opportunity to include questions you might have for                            your instructor. Your responses are sent to your instructor and may be                            used in classroom discussions.
Click on the My Response link to reflect on your understanding and provide feedback to your instructor. 
There is a Checkpoint at the end of each module and unit.                                                         This is a graded assignment and the score will be reported to your                            instructor. Your instructor may decide to assign points to your overall grade in                            the course for these assignments.
There are many numeric input problems within this course. For any of                            these you may use standard notation or scientific notation. It is highly                            recommended for very small or very large values that you use scientific                            notation.
For exponents, use the letter e. For example, for 6.022                            enter 6.022e23.

60,1330,1335,193,Gases,Gas Laws,The Ideal Gas Law,"To this point, four separate laws have beendiscussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of thegas:
Combining these four laws yields the ideal gaslaw.
The ideal gas lawrelation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws shows the relation between the pressure, volume, temperature,and number of moles of a gas:
relation between the pressure, volume, amount, and temperature of a gas under conditions derived by combination of the simple gas laws
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles ofthe gas, T is its temperature on the kelvin scale, andR is a constant called the ideal gas constant or theuniversal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, andtemperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required bydimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atmmol  K  and 8.314 kPa L mol  K .
Gases whose properties of P , V , and T are accuratelydescribed by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit idealbehavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypotheticalconstruct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explainthe gas laws as will be described later in this unit. Although all the calculationspresented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable forgases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the finalmodule of this unit, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for thenon-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and lowtemperatures.
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, theideal gas constantconstant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K, R , and the variable properties P , V , n , andT . Specifying any four of these terms will permit use ofthe ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following examples.
constant derived from the ideal gas equation R = 0.08206 L atm mol K or 8.314 L kPa mol K
If the number of moles of an ideal gas are kept constant under two different setsof conditions, a useful mathematical relationship called the combined gas law isobtained:
using units of atm, L, and K. Both sets of conditions are equal to the productof n  R (where n = the number of moles of the gas and R is the idealgas law constant).
When filled with air, a typical scuba tank witha volume of 13.2 L has a pressure of 153 atm. If the water temperature is 27 C, howmany liters of air will such a tank provide to a divers lungs at a depth ofapproximately 70 feet in the ocean where the pressure is 3.13 atm?
Letting 1 represent the air in the scuba tankand 2 represent the air in the lungs, and noting that body temperature (thetemperature the air will be in the lungs) is 37 C, we can identify thevariables as:

61,656,658,95,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Quantized Energy and the Photoelectric Effect,"One observation that could not be adequately explained by viewing light as waves                    is the light emitted as objects are heated. The wavelengths and intensities of the                     objects energy distribution can be measured by a spectrometer, and each distribution                     depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. As shown in the figure below,                     the maxima in these spectral distribution curves, \xce\xbbmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as                     the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that as a metal is heated it glows                     red, then orange, yellow, and eventually white (as the intensities of all of the visible                     wavelengths become appreciable at very high temperatures). This common observation was                          at the heart of the first paradox showing the fundamental limitations of classical physics                     that we will examine.
Using the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism, which held that electromagnetic waves                     could have any frequency within a continuously varying range, late 19th century scientists derived                     mathematical expressions for these energy distributions. These expressions fit the observed experimental                     blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths but diverged more and more as the wavelength became shorter,                    with the absurd consequence of infinitely large energies as the wavelength approached zero. This became                     known as the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"", since it implied that everyday objects at room temperature should                     be emitting large amounts of UV light and no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment                     that led to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.
Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for this phenomenon that                    fit the experimental observations. Planck treated the vibrating atoms as the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation                    (a premise from previous work), but instead of allowing the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a                    continuous set of energies (as allowed by classical physics, and as previously thought) Planck proposed that the vibrational                     energies were restricted to a discrete set of values for each frequency (i.e. that energy was quantized).

The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck\'s constant, in his honor.                    Although it appears that energy is emitted and absorbed continuously and not in                    discrete quantities, notice that the value of Planck\'s constant is very small,                    6.626 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy                    quantization is not observed in macroscopic phenomena.
The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the                    photoelectric effect. It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from                    the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than a                    threshold frequency, unique to the type of metal, was shone on it. Since the electrons in the metal had a                    certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed                    to have more energy - and therefore a higher frequency - to free the electrons. This is illustrated in the animation                    below.
According to classical wave theory, a wave\'s energy depends on its intensity                     (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. However, the frequency at which                     electrons start to be emitted from the metal (known as the threshold frequency)                     does not change when the intensity of the light changes. This is illustrated by comparing                     the animation below with the animation above.
Although the threshold frequency doesn\'t change with changes in intensity (brightness) of the light,                     once the threshold is met the number of electrons emitted within a given time period (i.e. the electric                     current) increases with increasing intensity of the light. This is shown in the following two animations.
Along with the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons also does not depend                     on the intensity of the light. However, if the frequency of the light is increased the kinetic energy of                     the electrons increases as well. This is shown in the graph below.
Different metals have different threshold frequencies. As we have seen in the                    previous animations the wavelength of the frequency threshold for sodium is                    approximately 500 nm. As seen in the animation below the wavelength of the                    threshold frequency for calcium is approximately 400 nm.
In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck\'s quantization                     findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work,                     and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).                     Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated could be                    applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the                    metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of                    particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency,                    according to Planck\'s formula, E = h\xce\xbd (or, in terms of wavelength using c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd,                    E = hc/\xce\xbb).
Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency                    greater than the threshold). Einstein also argued that the light intensity did                    not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to                    the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This                    explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing                    brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the                    likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.
With Einstein\'s findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Some                    phenomena could be explained by viewing light as a wave and other phenomena,                    such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by viewing light as a                    particle. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light                    is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality.
When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon                atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the                photon being emitted?
We use the part of Planck\'s equation that includes the wavelength, h\xce\xbd\xce\xbb, and convert                units of nanometers to meters so that the units of \xce\xbb correspond to the length units of c.

62,29,29,16,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Module Summary and Quiz,"Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass                    numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the                    number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is                    composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the                    average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the                    atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, or two-letter                     abbreviations for the atoms.
A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact                    numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives                    the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula                    indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick                    and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements                    of atoms.
The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements                    led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged                    in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known                    as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar                    chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and                    nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition                    metals. Groups are numbered 1 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are                    known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals;                    those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are                    the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.
Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of                    electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the                    preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged                    ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and,                    to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed                    to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in                    the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively                    charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions.                    Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic                    (containing more than one atom).
Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally                    form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead                    consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms                    that behave as a single unit), are called covalent or molecular compounds. Covalent compounds                    usually form from two nonmetals.
Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular                    compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds                    typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written                    first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to ide. For                    example, K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and                        FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule                    of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and                        N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the ide suffix to ic,                    and adding cacid;d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the                    ending of the anion to ic, and adding cacid;d H2CO3 is                    carbonic acid.

63,130,130,31,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Introduction to Aqueous Solutions,"In preceding sections, we focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter            that contain only one type of element or compound. However, mixturessamples of matter            containing two or more substances physically combinedare more commonly encountered in            nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition            of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount            of oxygen in a planets atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The            relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known            as an calloyd) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative            amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving            the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage            determines its sweetness. In this section, we will describe one of the most common ways            in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.
We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the                    composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout                    its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been                    implemented in many forms of man-made technology. Here we will introduce some of                    the basic properties of solutions.
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration.                    Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentrationquantitative measure of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present in a solution                    that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component                    is called the solventsolution component present in a concentration that is higher relative to other components and may be viewed as the medium in which the other                    components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent                    are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the                    solvent is called an aqueous solutionsolution for which water is the solvent. Water has the ability to dissolve many                    different types of substances. Because of this, it is often referred to as the                    universal solvent.

A solutesolution component present in a concentration less than that of the solvent is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower                    concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with                    qualitative terms such as dilutequalitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively low concentration (of relatively low concentration) and                    concentratedqualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively high concentration (of relatively high concentration).

64,92,92,26,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Exploring Electron and Molecular Geometry,"Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules.                    However, molecular structure is actually three-dimensional, and it is important                    to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances, angles, and                    relative arrangements in space. A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds                    that include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or                    bond length) is the distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms along the                    straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in ngstroms (1                     = 10 m) or picometers (1 pm = 10 m, 100 pm = 1                    ).
Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict                    the molecular structure, including approximate bond angles around a central                    atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds and lone electron                    pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the                    valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes                    repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them.                    The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs                    of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The                    electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions                    of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as                    possible.
VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom                    and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should                    understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair repulsions.                    Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron                    attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a                    particular molecular structure.
As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous                        BeF2 molecule. The Lewis structure of BeF2 shows only                    two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone                    pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible,                    and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density                    is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. The                    bond angle is 180.
In the activity below, you will explore the three dimensional shapes that                    molecules take based on VSEPR theory. In this first activity, we will look at                    electron pair geometries in which the shapes are determined by the total number                    of pairs of electrons surrounding the central atom. Fill in the tables as                    directed.

It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not                    the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries                    (electron geometries) you determined in the previous activities describe all                    regions where electrons are located around the central atom. Molecular structure                    describes the location of the atoms around the central atom, not the                    electrons.
We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that                    includes all electron pairs the electron-pair geometry or electron geometry. The                    structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is                    called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as                    the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the                    central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on                    the central atom.
For example, the methane molecule, CH4, which is the major component                    of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon                    atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure.                    On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH3, also has four electron                    pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral                    electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is                    not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape                    of the molecule.

65,103,103,28,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Formula Mass,"Earlier we described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of averageatomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup ofsubstances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substancesformula.
For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atomscomposing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may becorrectly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic andnow primarily used in the production of the canti-stickd polymer, Teflon. Themolecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains onecarbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecularmass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the averageatomic masses of these atoms. The table below outlines the calculations used toderive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.

Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and theactive ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Adviland Motrin. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound?
Molecules of this compound are comprised of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2oxygen atoms. Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass forthis compound is therefore:
Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios toyield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compoundis calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compounds formula.Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not representthe composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred toas the cmolecular mass.d
As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common tablesalt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations,Na+, and chloride anions, Cl, combined in a 1:1ratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu.
Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ioniccompound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various waterpurification processes. What is the formula mass (amu) of this compound?

66,568,570,89,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Molarity,"Concentrations of solutions may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of            measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. Molarity (M)unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution is a useful            concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number            of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution.
unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution
A 355mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the                molar concentration of sucrose in the beverage?
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the                molarity can be calculated using the definition of molarity. Per this definition,                the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:
How much sugar (mol) is contained in 10 mL of the soda described in the example                above?
In this case, we can rearrange the definition of molarity to isolate the quantity                sought, moles of sugar. We then substitute the value for molarity that we derived in                the previous example, 0.375 M.
Distilled white vinegar is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H,                in water. A 0.500L vinegar solution contains 25.2 g of acetic acid. What is the                concentration of the acetic acid solution in units of molarity?
To calculate the molarity, you need mol of solute. Convert grams of acetic acid to                mol.
Substitute the values for mol and L into the definition of molarity.
How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30M solution?
The volume and molarity of the solution are specified. We can rearrange the                definition of molarity to isolate mole.
mol solute = M  L solution
Finally, this molar amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:
When performing calculations stepwise, it is important to refrain from rounding any            intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result.            In the previous example, the molar amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol,            would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be reported; however, although the            last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the            intermediate calculation. If we had not retained this guard digit, the final calculation            for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g.
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, we can also avoid            rounding errors by performing computations in a single step. This eliminates            intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.
In many situations you will be concerned with the molarity of a solution as                    described above. However, sometimes it may be useful to consider the                    concentration of individual ions in solution. Remember the equation for                    molarity:
When ionic compounds are dissolved in water they dissociate into their                    constituent ions. When sodium chloride, NaCl, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Na+ and one Cl ion per formula unit dissolved.                    However, when calcium chloride, CaCl2, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Ca2+ and two Cl ions per formula unit                    dissolved. This means that the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of Ca2+ ions when CaCl2 is                    dissolved in water. Likewise the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of the solution.
Animations developed from PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado                    Boulder, https://phet.colorado.edu.
The solution of CaCl2 in the right animation has twice the                    concentration of Cl to Ca2+.
What is the concentration in molarity of a CaCl2 solution in which 4.85 g                of CaCl2 has been dissolved in water to form 850 mL of solution? What is                the concentration in molarity of the Ca2+ ions in the solution                and the Cl ions in the solution?
Calculating the molarity of the CaCl2 solution is the same process as we                have seen previously.
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
Since there is one Ca2+ ion produced per formula unit of                    CaCl2, the concentration of Ca2+ is also 0.0514                M.
Since there are two Cl ions produced per formula unit of                CaCl2, the concentration of Cl is:
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Ca2+ is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Cl is 0.103 M.

However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.
Based on the information in the massspectra for zirconium in the image above, we can determine that there are 5naturally occurring isotopes of zirconium, Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr, and Zreach with an approximate percent abundance as seen in the table below.

68,531,533,86,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ions,"Atoms are electrically neutral having the same number of protons and electrons. However,            under certain circumstances atoms can become electrically charged. When an atom becomes            electrically charged it is called an ionAn atom that has gained or lost electrons and therefore is electrically charged.. As will be discussed in more detail later in            this unit, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing            electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and            is called an anionA negatively charged ion.. Positively charged atoms called cationsA positively charged ion. are formed when an atom            loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11            electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11             10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two            electrons it will become an anion with a 2 charge (8  10 = 2).

69,739,742,106,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Dilution of Solution,"Dilutionprocess of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes is the process whereby the concentration of a solution is lessened by the            addition of solvent. For example, we might say that a glass of iced tea becomes            increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the            volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby            reducing the relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its            taste.
process of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes
Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By            adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can            achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically            sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is            appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must            be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of            common laboratory reagents.
A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations            of a solution before and after the dilution process. According to the definition of            molarity, the molar amount of solute in a solution is equal to the product of the            solutions molarity and its volume in liters:
Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:
where the subscripts d and d refer to the solution before and after the dilution,            respectively. Since the dilution process does not change the amount of solute in the            solution, n1 = n2. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to            one another.
Although we derived this equation using molarity as the unit of concentration and                    liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be                    used, so long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method.                    Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more                    general form:
where C and V are concentration                    and volume, respectively.
If 0.850 L of a 5.00M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is                diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the                diluted solution?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and                    C1, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, V2.                We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, C2. We thus                rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate C2:
Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased                from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), we would expect the diluted solutions concentration to be                less than one-half 5 M. We will compare this ballpark estimate to the calculated                result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, an improper                substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms                on the right side of this equation yields:
This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (its a bit less than one-half the                stock concentration, 5 M).
What volume of 0.12 M HBr can be prepared from 11 mL (0.011 L) of 0.45 M HBr?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and                    C1, and the concentration of the resultant diluted solution,                    C2. We need to find the volume of the diluted solution,                V2. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate                    V2:
Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the                original concentration (0.45 M), we would expect the volume of the diluted solution                to be roughly four times the original volume, or around 44 mL. Substituting the                given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
The volume of the 0.12 M solution is 0.041 L (41 mL). The result is reasonable and                compares well with our rough estimate.
What volume of 1.59 M KOH is required to prepare 5.00 L of 0.100 M KOH?
We are given the concentration of a stock solution, C1, and the volume and                concentration of the resultant diluted solution, V2 and C2. We                need to find the volume of the stock solution, V1. We thus rearrange the                dilution equation in order to isolate V1:
Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that                of the stock solution (1.59 M), we would expect the volume of the stock solution to                be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters.                Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
Thus, we would need 0.314 L of the 1.59 M solution to prepare the desired solution.                This result is consistent with our rough estimate.

70,867,870,119,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules,"Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these            interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange            information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or            feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between            chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to            classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module            will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions:            precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.
A precipitation reactionreaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more)            solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic            compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement,            double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and            are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in            animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and            specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical            analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric            methods for determining the composition of matter. Watch the video below to see an example of a precipitation reaction.
reaction that produces one or more insoluble products; when reactants are ionic compounds, sometimes called double-displacement or metathesis
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is            quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a            substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively            large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution            conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with            relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that            readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is            provided later in this course. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids            formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that            have been observed for many ionic compounds. Note that these guidelines are not            comprehensive, they do not cover every possible combination of cations and anions. It is            a good idea to memorize these guidelines.
Determine the solubility of the following compounds:
a) AgNO3
b) BaSO4
c) CaCO3
a) Nitrates are always soluble.
b) While sulfate compounds are often soluble, exceptions include: Ag+,                    Hg22+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Sr2+,                    Ba2+
c) Carbonate compounds are insoluble unless combined with a cation that is always                soluble.
We use these solubility rules to predict whether or not a precipitation reaction will            occur between two ionic compounds. A vivid example of precipitation is observed when            solutions of potassium iodide and lead(II) nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of            solid lead(II) iodide:
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble            compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general            solubility of iodide salts.
The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:
Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artists pigment known            as iodine yellow. The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for            fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
In order to determine whether or not a precipitation reaction will occur one needs to            identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion            pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver            nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing Ag+,                NO3, Na+, and F ions. Aside from the            two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two            additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3            and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgF            is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation            reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
potassium sulfate and barium nitrate
K+, SO42, Ba2+,                        NO3
KNO3 and BaSO4
If any of the possible products are insoluble a precipitate will form.
This reaction will form a precipitate of BaSO4. Therefore, the net ionic                equation is:
Predict the result of mixing reasonably concentrated solutions of the following ionic                compounds. If precipitation is expected, write a balanced net ionic equation for the                reaction.
sodium carbonate and ammonium nitrate
Na+, CO32, NH4+,                        NO3
NaNO3 and (NH4)2CO3
If all possible products are soluble, no reaction occurs.
The ions present in the reactants will remain unchanged when these two aqueous                solutions are combined. No reaction will occur.

71,704,706,102,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Boiling Point Elevation and Freezing Point Depression,"As described previously, the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its            vapor pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a            solution is lowered due to the presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that            the solutions boiling point will subsequently be increased. Compared to pure solvent, a            solution, therefore, will require a higher temperature to achieve any given vapor            pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere. The increase            in boiling point observed when nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, \xceTb, is called boiling point elevation.
Boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the molal concentration of                    solute species:
where Kb is the boiling point elevation                    constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute species.
Boiling point elevation constants are characteristic properties that depend on the            identity of the solvent. Values of Kb for several            solvents are listed in the table below.
Solutions freeze at lower temperatures than pure liquids. This phenomenon is exploited in            cde-icingd schemes that use salt, calcium chloride, or urea to melt ice on roads and            sidewalks, and in the use of ethylene glycol as an cantifreezed in automobile radiators.            Seawater freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water, and so the Arctic and            Antarctic oceans remain unfrozen even at temperatures below 0 C (as do the body fluids            of fish and other cold-blooded sea animals that live in these oceans).
The decrease in freezing point of a dilute solution compared to that of the pure solvent,                \xceTf, is called the freezing point depression.
Freezing point depression is directly proportional to the molal concentration of                    solute species:
where Kf is the freezing point depression                    constant and m is the molal concentration (molality) of all solute                    species.
Just as for boiling point elevation constants, these are characteristic properties whose            values depend on the chemical identity of the solvent. Values of Kf for several solvents are listed below.
The extent to which boiling point is increased and freezing point decrease for a solvent            depends on the total number of solute particles present in a given amount of solvent,            not on the mass or size or chemical identities of the particles. A 1 m aqueous solution            of sucrose (342 g/mol) and a 1 m aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (62 g/mol) will            exhibit the same boiling point because each solution has one mole of solute particles            (molecules) per kilogram of solvent.
What is the boiling point of a 0.33 m solution of a                nonvolatile solute in benzene?
First, calculate the change in boiling point.
Since we know that boiling point increases with the addition of a solute, add the                boiling point elevation to the pure solvents boiling point.
Find the boiling point and freezing point of a solution of 92.1 g of iodine,                    I2, in 800.0 g of chloroform, CHCl3, assuming that the                iodine is nonvolatile and that the solution is ideal. The boiling point of pure                chloroform is 61.2 oC.
First we will need to convert mass of I2 to moles in order to determine                the molality of the solution.
Calculate the molality of the solution.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in boiling point and molal                concentration to determine how much the boiling point changes.
Determine the new boiling point from the boiling point of the pure solvent and the                change.
Use the direct proportionality between the change in freezing point and molal                concentration to determine how much the freezing point changes.
Determine the new freezing point from the freezing point of the pure solvent and the                change.
The colligative effects on vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point                    described in the previous section are conveniently summarized by comparing the                    phase diagrams for a pure liquid and a solution derived from that liquid. Phase                    diagrams for water and an aqueous solution are shown in the diagram below.
The liquid-vapor curve for the solution is located beneath the corresponding                    curve for the solvent, depicting the vapor pressure lowering, \xceP, that results                    from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute. Consequently, at any given pressure,                    the solutions boiling point is observed at a higher temperature than that for                    the pure solvent, reflecting the boiling point elevation, \xceTb, associated with                    the presence of nonvolatile solute. The solid-liquid curve for the solution is                    displaced left of that for the pure solvent, representing the freezing point                    depression, \xceTf, that accompanies solution formation. Finally, notice that the                    solid-gas curves for the solvent and its solution are identical. This is the                    case for many solutions comprising liquid solvents and nonvolatile solutes. Just                    as for vaporization, when a solution of this sort is frozen, it is actually just                    the solvent molecules that undergo the liquid-to-solid transition, forming pure                    solid solvent that excludes solute species. The solid and gaseous phases,                    therefore, are composed of solvent only, and so transitions between these phases                    are not subject to colligative effects.

72,8,8,7,Thermochemistry,Introduction,Introduction to Thermochemistry,"Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in            energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function            without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about 85% of US energy            consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We            use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw materials,            manufactured goods, and people (27%); for industrial production (21%); and to heat and            power our homes and businesses (10%). While these combustion reactions help us meet our            essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific            community as a major contributor to global climate change.
Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than            combustion. For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or            flashlight results from chemical reactions. This unit introduces many of the basic            ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with a            focus on thermal energy.

73,339,340,57,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Heat Capacity and Specific Heat,"Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorieunit of heat or other energy; the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius; 1 cal is defined as 4.184 J is the amount of            energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this            quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water.            The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is            still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used            in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and            energy is the jouleSI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of            1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James            Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is            also called 1 newtonmeter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its            definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change: heat            capacity and specific heat capacity.
The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of                            heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change                            (\xceT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):
Heat capacityextensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs                    or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive propertyits value is                    proportional to the amount of the substance.
extensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans.
The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small                    pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large                    pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more                    atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of                    those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan                    is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature                    of the pan by 50.0 C:
The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires                    90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 C. The larger pan has a                    (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material                    requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same                    temperature change:
The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its cspecific                            heat,d is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram                            of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):
Specific heat capacityintensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or                    releasing heat. It is an intensive propertythe type, but not the amount, of the                    substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a                    mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is                    therefore:
intensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can                    also calculate the specific heat of iron:
Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of                    the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the                    material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of                    energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from                    a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity,                    also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular                    substance and has units of J/mol C.",,"Specific heat capacityintensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or                    releasing heat.

74,946,949,130,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Accuracy and Precision,"Scientists typically make repeated measurements ofa quantity to ensure the quality of their findings and to know both the precisionhow closely a measurement matches the same measurement when repeated and the accuracyhow closely a measurement aligns with a correct value of their results. Measurements are said to be precise if they yield verysimilar results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurateif it yields a result that is very close to the true or accepted value. Precise valuesagree with each other; accurate values agree with a true value. These characterizationscan be extended to other contexts, such as the results of an archery competition.

Suppose a quality control chemist at apharmaceutical company is tasked with checking the accuracy and precision of threedifferent machines that are meant to dispense 10 ounces (296 mL) of cough syrup intostorage bottles.

Results for dispenser #2 represent improvedaccuracy (each volume is less than 3 mL away from 296 mL) but worse precision (volumesvary by more than 4 mL). Finally, she can report that dispenser #3 is working well,dispensing cough syrup both accurately (all volumes within 0.1 mL of the target volume)and precisely (volumes differing from each other by no more than 0.2 mL).
Let's take another look at the table in theexercise above. The results of Anita's measurements, which are neither accurate norprecise, represent random error. Random errorError produced from a series of measurement where there is no observablepattern in the results. occurs when the results of a series of measurements produce no observablepattern. Notice that in Anita's measurements some of the values are below theaccepted value and some are above.
Error produced from a series of measurement where there is no observablepattern in the results.
If we consider Lynette's measured values, wesee that they are precise, but not accurate. This type of data represents systematicerror. Systematic errorError in a series of data in which there is an observable pattern. occurs when the results of a series of measurements produces an observablepattern. Each of Lynette's measurements is less than the accepted value byapproximately the same amount.
Error in a series of data in which there is an observable pattern.
When systematic error is present, it is oftenpossible to pinpoint the source of the error. In Lynette's measurements, it may bepossible that the balance she used to measure the mass of the copper is off byapproximately 1.7 g. This would be something that would be prudent for Lynette to checkto see if she could determine the source of her error. With random error on the otherhand, it is difficult if not impossible to determine the source of the error. Whileideally data that is collected in an investigation is both accurate and precise, datawhich shows systematic error is preferable to that which shows random error.

75,793,796,111,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Hess\'s Law,"There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure            it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy            changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make            accurate measurements difficult to carry out experimentally. And even when a reaction is            not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat            involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.
Hesss law allows us to relate the enthalpies of different reactions.
If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the                    enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of                    the various steps.
Hesss law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only            on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to            finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon            dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is            written:
We can also consider a two-step process, where first carbon monoxide is formed in the            first step:
In the second step, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical            changes:
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:
According to Hesss law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the            enthalpy changes of the steps. Because, in this case, the first two steps are combustion            reactions, we can use the enthalpies of combustion found on the table on page:                Enthalpies of                Combustion to find the enthalpy change of the entire reaction from            its two steps:
The result is shown in the diagram below. We see that \xceH of the            overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall                \xceH for the reaction = sum of \xceH            values for reaction cstepsd in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and            physical processes.
Before we further practice using Hesss law, let us recall two important features of \xceH.
\xceH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or            products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of                NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ :
When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the \xceH            will be twice as large:
In general, if we multiply (or divide) an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change            should also be multiplied (or divided) by the same number.
\xceH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and            opposite in sign to \xceH for the reaction in the reverse            direction. For example, given that:
Then, for the creversed reaction, the enthalpy change is also creversedd:
Determine the enthalpy of formation, \xceHf of                    FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process                that occurs under standard state conditions:
We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s),                which is equal to \xceH for the reaction:
Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find \xceH is the sum of the two reactions with known \xceH values, so we must sum their \xceHs:
The enthalpy of formation, \xceHf, of                    FeCl3(s) is .5 kJ/mol.
Many times the given steps do not add up to the equation in question and some            manipulation of the equations is required. Here we will look at some such examples.
Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:
Use the reactions here to determine the \xceH for reaction (i):
Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they                add up to reaction (i). Going from left to right in (i), we first see that ClF(g) is                needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (iii) by 1/2,                which means that the \xceH change is also multiplied by 1/2:
Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse                and halve reaction (ii), which means that the \xceH changes sign and is halved:
To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of \xceH:
Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

76,407,409,69,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,Types of Crystalline Solids,"Crystalline solids are generally classified according the nature of the forces that hold            its particles together. These forces are primarily responsible for the physical            properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections provide descriptions of            the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and            molecular.
Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive                    and negative ions that are held together by electrostatic attractions, which can                    be quite strong. Many ionic crystals also have high melting points. This is due                    to the very strong attractions between the ionsin ionic compounds, the                    attractions between full charges are (much) larger than those between the                    partial charges in polar molecular compounds. Although they are hard, they also                    tend to be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not                    conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when molten or dissolved because                    their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a                    metallic element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.
Metallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by                    metal atoms. The structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform                    distribution of atomic nuclei within a csead of delocalized electrons. The atoms                    within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as                    metallic bonding that gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All                    exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic luster, and                    malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability                    (the ability to deform under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and,                    therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting points of the metals                    vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt                    below 200 C. Several post-transition metals also have low melting points,                    whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above 1000 C. These                    differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the                    metals.
Covalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other                    nonmetals, and some covalent compounds such as silicon dioxide (sand) and                    silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have                    networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a                    network of covalent bonds, as shown below. To break or to melt a covalent                    network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds are                    relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by                    hardness, strength, and high melting points. For example, diamond is one of the                    hardest substances known and melts above 3500 C.
Molecular solids, such as ice, sucrose (table sugar), and iodine, as shown below                    , are composed of neutral molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces                    between the units present in different crystals vary widely, as indicated by the                    melting points of the crystals. Small symmetrical molecules (nonpolar                    molecules), such as H2, N2, O2, and                        F2, have weak attractive forces and form molecular solids with                    very low melting points (below  C). Substances consisting of larger,                    nonpolar molecules have larger attractive forces and melt at higher                    temperatures. Molecular solids composed of molecules with permanent dipole                    moments (polar molecules) melt at still higher temperatures. Examples include                    ice (melting point, 0 C) and table sugar (melting point, 185 C).

77,60,60,20,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Changes in Enthalpy,"Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to            describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as            the sum of a systems internal energy (E) and the mathematical            product of its pressure (P) and volume (V):
Since it is derived from three state functions (E, P, and V), enthalpy is also a state            function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only            enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes            that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical            changes), the enthalpy change (\xceH) is:
The mathematical product P\xceV represents            work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By            their definitions, the arithmetic signs of \xceV and w will always be opposite:
Substituting this equation into the enthalpy-change equation yields:
From definition of internal energy, \xceE = q + w, we then get:
Where the subscript on heat, qp , is included to            specify that this is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
If a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the                  only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow                  (qp) and enthalpy change (\xceH) for the process are                      equal.
for processes occurring at constant pressure.
The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of            the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially            constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction            measured in a bomb calorimeter, as discussed previously, is not equal to \xceH because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents            expansion work from occurring. Chemists usually perform experiments under normal            atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure where q =                \xceH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for            determining heat.
The following shows how the above conventions apply when we use \xceH for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas: :
When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of                NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat is produced. What is \xceH for the following reaction, corresponding to the enthalpy                change per mole of acid reacting?
For the reaction of 0.0500 mol HCl acid, q = .9 kJ. This                leads us to the ratio                                                                        .9 kJ                            0.0500 mol HCl                                                            Which can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1                mole of HCl reacts:
The enthalpy change when 1 mole of HCl reacts is therefore  kJ. Since in the                chemical equation, one mole of HCl reacts, we write the enthalpy of the reaction as:
The following example illustrates that you need to take both stoichiometry and limiting            reactants into account when determining the \xceH for a chemical            reaction.
A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C12H22O11.                When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO3, 43.7 kJ of heat is                produced. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.
Moles of C12H22O11 available:
Moles of KClO3 available:
Since,
is needed, C12H22O11 is the excess reactant and                    KClO3 is the limiting reactant. Because all of the KClO3 reacts, we                can say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 7.19 g of KClO3 reacts. (Note that we                cannot say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 2.67 g of sucrose reaction, because                not all of the sucrose reacted in this experiment.) [The reaction uses 8 mol                    KClO3, and the conversion factor is,                                                                                                        −                                43.7 kJ                                                                                        0.0587 mol KCl                                                                    O                                    3                                                                                                                        ]

78,901,904,126,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Laws: Volume and Temperature,"If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount                    of air at atmospheric pressure, lets say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a                    refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both                    the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very                    cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.
These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a                    confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as                    the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.                    Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed                    and graphed.
The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at                    constant pressure is known as Charless law in recognition of the French                    scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre Csar Charles.
Charless law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly                            proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is                            held constant.
Mathematically, this can be written as:
*Note that temperatures must be in units of kelvin for any gas law                            calculation.
A sample of carbon dioxide, CO2, occupies 0.300 L at 10.0 C and 750 torr.                What volume will the gas have at 30.0 C and 750 torr?
Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at                constant pressure, this is a job for Charless law.

79,1273,1278,182,Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:

Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems","jellies, gels, pearl, opal (H2O in SiO2)","jellies, gels, pearl, opal (H2O in SiO2) and pearl are all examples of what?",0,0,0.0,86.05610656738281
80,24,24,13,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Acids,"Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known            as acidssubstances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water. The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail later in this            course, but for now, it will suffice to note that many acids release hydrogen ions,                H+, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a            mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compounds name.
substances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water
If the compound is a binary acidcompound containing two different elements (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic                    element) use the steps below to name the acid.
compound containing two different elements
For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the                    solution is called hydrochloric acid. Several other examples of this                    nomenclature are shown in table below.
Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or                    coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you                    will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known                    as oxyacidscompound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water), compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other                    element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the                    compound (you will learn the details of this later in this course). Typical                    oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion.                    To name oxyacids follow the steps below.
compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water)
For example, consider H2CO3 (which you might be tempted to                    call chydrogen carbonated). To name this correctly, chydrogend is omitted; the                    ate of carbonate is replace with ic; and acid is addedso its name is carbonic                    acid. Other examples are given in Table. There are some exceptions to the                    general naming method (e.g., H2SO4 is called sulfuric                    acid, not sulfic acid, and H2SO3 is sulfurous, not                    sulfous, acid).

81,329,330,56,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Heating and Cooling Curves,"In the unit on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or            released by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature            change, \xceT, was introduced:
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,            but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a            temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat            is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of            increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a            change in state, its temperature remains constant.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply            heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the waters            temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant            despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is            maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to            provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the            boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase            transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state            is in progress.
The slide show below shows the change in temperature that occurs when a constant source            of heat is added to ice with an initial temperature of -10.0 oC. The resulting graph is            known as a heating curve.
How much heat is required to convert 135 g of ice at  C into water vapor at 120                C?
The transition described involves the following steps:
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in                phase) is: q = m  c  \xceT (see previous chapter on                thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given by q = n  \xceH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water,                and steam, and enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, we have:
Converting the quantities in J to kJ permits them to be summed, yielding the total                heat required:
The values below for water are used in the following example:
Calculate the heat required to convert 25.0 g solid ethanol at -135.0 oC                to liquid at 72.0 oC. Specific heat of solid ethanol = 0.97 J/g                    oC. Specific heat liquid ethanol 2.3 J/ g oC.

82,929,932,129,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Combustion Analysis,"The elemental composition of hydrocarbons and            related compounds may be determined via a gravimetric method known as combustion            analysis. In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high            temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield            gaseous products of known identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for            example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only products. The gaseous            combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing            compounds that selectively absorb each product, as shown in the figure below. The mass            increase of each device corresponds to the mass of the absorbed product and may be used            in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the relevant            element.
This schematic diagram illustrates the                basic components of a combustion analysis device for determining the carbon and                hydrogen content of a sample.
Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to                produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic items. A combustion                analysis of a 0.00126 g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2                and 0.00161 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?
The primary assumption in this exercise is that                all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon dioxide, and all the                hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:
{\\mathrm C}_x{\\mathrm                H}_y\\mathit(s\\mathit)+excess\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)\\longrightarrow                x\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)+\\frac y2\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O(g)\\;\\;
Note that a balanced equation is not necessary                for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the compound, only the                subscripts x and y are needed.
First, calculate the molar amounts of carbon                and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the carbon dioxide and                water, respectively. With these molar amounts, the empirical formula for the                compound may be written as described in an earlier unit. An outline of this                approach is given in the following flow chart:

The empirical formula for the compound is then                derived by identifying the smallest whole-number multiples for these molar amounts.                The H-to-C molar ratio is:

The subject of acid-base chemistry will be                    discussed in much more detail later in this course.
reaction involving the transfer of a hydrogen ion between                                    reactant species
For purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common                    types of acid-base reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In this                    context, an                         acid                                                                                    substance that produces H3O+ when dissolved                                    in water                                                                         is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions,                        H3O+. As an example, consider the equation shown                    here:
substance that produces H3O+ when dissolved                                    in water
The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an                    acid. When dissolved in water, H3O+ ions are produced by a                    chemical reaction in which H+ ions are transferred from HCl molecules                    to H2O molecules.
The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is                    essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water                    will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are                    called                         strong acids                                                                                    acids that reacts completely when dissolved in water to yield                                    hydronium ions                                                                        , and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are                    classified as strong, as seen in the table below. A far greater number of                    compounds behave as                         weak acids                                                                                    acids that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved in water                                    to yield hydronium ions                                                                         and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of                    dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small                    amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being                    the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the                    stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with                    body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient                    in food vinegars:
acids that reacts completely when dissolved in water to yield                                    hydronium ions
acids that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved in water                                    to yield hydronium ions
When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid                    molecules are present in the ionized form,                        CH3CO2 . (The use of a double-arrow in the                    equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept                    addressed fully later in this course).
A                                 base                                                                                                            substance that produces OH when dissolved in                                            water                                                                                                 is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide                            ions, OH. The most common bases are ionic compounds composed                            of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with                            the hydroxide ionfor example, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. When these                            compounds dissolve in water, hydroxide ions are released directly into                            the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)2 dissolve in water                            and dissociate completely to produce cations (K+ and                                Ba2+, respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH.                            These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in                            water, are considered                                 strong bases                                                                                                            bases that reacts completely when dissolved in water to                                            yield hydroxide ions                                                                                                .

Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in                            water:
This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in                            water, NaOH dissociates to yield Na+ and OH ions.                            This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide                            ions. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic                            compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other                            ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.
Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when                            dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases,                            these compounds react only partially and so are classified as                                 weak bases                                                                                                            bases that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved                                            in water to yield hydroxide ions                                                                                                . These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and                            important commodities in various technologies. For example, global                            production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric                            tons annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw                            material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active                            ingredient in household cleaners. When dissolved in water, ammonia                            reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here:
bases that reacts only to a slight extent when dissolved                                            in water to yield hydroxide ions
This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the                            transfer of H+ ions from water molecules to ammonia                            molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved                            ammonia is present as NH4+ ions.
The chemical reactions described in which acids and bases dissolved in                            water produce hydronium and hydroxide ions, respectively, are, by                            definition, acid-base reactions. In these reactions, water serves as                            both a solvent and a reactant. A neutralization reaction is a specific                            type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a                            base, the products are often a salt and water, and neither reactant is                            the water itself:
To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a                            typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an aqueous suspension of solid                                Mg(OH)2 is ingested to ease symptoms associated with                            excess stomach acid (HCl):
Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium                            chloride.
Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the                                following reaction:
The weak acid hydrogen hypochlorite reacts with water.
The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H2O. Since the                                substance is reported to be an acid, its reaction with water will                                involve the transfer of H+ from HOCl to H2O to                                generate hydronium ions, H3O+ and hypochlorite                                ions, OCl.
A double-arrow is appropriate in this equation because it indicates                                the HOCl is a weak acid that has not reacted completely.
Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reaction for the                                following reaction:

Since this is a neutralization reaction, the                                two products will be water and a salt composed of the cation of the                                ionic hydroxide (Ba2+) and the anion generated when the                                acid transfers its hydrogen ion (NO3).

84,787,790,111,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Hess\'s Law,"There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure            it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy            changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make            accurate measurements difficult to carry out experimentally. And even when a reaction is            not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat            involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.
Hesss law allows us to relate the enthalpies of different reactions.
If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the                    enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of                    the various steps.
Hesss law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only            on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to            finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon            dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is            written:
We can also consider a two-step process, where first carbon monoxide is formed in the            first step:
In the second step, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical            changes:
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:
According to Hesss law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the            enthalpy changes of the steps. Because, in this case, the first two steps are combustion            reactions, we can use the enthalpies of combustion found on the table on page:                Enthalpies of                Combustion to find the enthalpy change of the entire reaction from            its two steps:
The result is shown in the diagram below. We see that \xceH of the            overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall                \xceH for the reaction = sum of \xceH            values for reaction cstepsd in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and            physical processes.
Before we further practice using Hesss law, let us recall two important features of \xceH.
\xceH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or            products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of                NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ :
When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the \xceH            will be twice as large:
In general, if we multiply (or divide) an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change            should also be multiplied (or divided) by the same number.
\xceH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and            opposite in sign to \xceH for the reaction in the reverse            direction. For example, given that:
Then, for the creversed reaction, the enthalpy change is also creversedd:
Determine the enthalpy of formation, \xceHf of                    FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process                that occurs under standard state conditions:
We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s),                which is equal to \xceH for the reaction:
Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find \xceH is the sum of the two reactions with known \xceH values, so we must sum their \xceHs:
The enthalpy of formation, \xceHf, of                    FeCl3(s) is .5 kJ/mol.
Many times the given steps do not add up to the equation in question and some            manipulation of the equations is required. Here we will look at some such examples.
Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:
Use the reactions here to determine the \xceH for reaction (i):
Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they                add up to reaction (i). Going from left to right in (i), we first see that ClF(g) is                needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (iii) by 1/2,                which means that the \xceH change is also multiplied by 1/2:
Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse                and halve reaction (ii), which means that the \xceH changes sign and is halved:
To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of \xceH:
Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

85,200,200,41,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP),"The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most            fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely            regarded as the cfather of modern chemistry,d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, cIt took the mob only a moment            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.
As described in an earlier in this course, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for            answers to many of the questions that ask cHow much?d We can answer the question with            masses of substances or volumes of solutions. However, we can also answer this question            another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the            pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the            ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal            with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions            involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will            provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already            discussed.

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of                    molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and                    temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a standard temperature                        and pressure (STP)standard temperature                            and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm                    (101.325 kPa). At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 Lthis is                    referred to as the standard molar volumevolume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally.
standard temperature                            and pressure (STP)
volume of 1 mole of gas at STP, approximately 22.4 L for gases behaving ideally
One mole of any gas at STP has a volume of 22.4 L.
*Note that this relationship ONLY applies when the gas is at STP.
We can calculate the molar volume of a gas by using the ideal gas law.
What is the volume of 1.00 mol of He at a pressure of 1.00 atm and 273.15                        K?
\equire{cancel} V = \\frac{(1.00 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(273.15 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1.00                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}} = 22.4 \\mathrm{L}
Recognize that the answer in the above example would have been the same                    regardless of the type of gas identified in the problem. 1 mole of ANY gas at                    STP has a volume of This provides a simple conversion factor to use in                    situations when gases are at STP.
A 4.9 g sample of methane, CH4, gas is at standard temperature and                        pressure. What volume does the sample occupy?
Notice here that the amount of gas is given in grams. We will need to convert                        from grams to moles and then use the relationship between moles and volume                        of gas at STP to convert to volume.
\\mathrm{g} \ightarrow \\mathrm{mol} \ightarrow                            \\mathrm{L}

The molar volume of a gas can also be applied to more complex stoichiometry                    problems involving reactions. We can add volume of gases to our stoichiometry                    flowchart that we saw earlier.
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas. Zinc reacts with                        hydrochloric acid according to the reactions below.
5.8 g of zinc is reacted with an excess amount hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen                        gas produced is collected at STP. What is the volume of the hydrogen                        gas?
We will use the following steps to solve this problem according to our                        flowchart above:

86,62,62,20,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Changes in Enthalpy,"Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to            describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as            the sum of a systems internal energy (E) and the mathematical            product of its pressure (P) and volume (V):
Since it is derived from three state functions (E, P, and V), enthalpy is also a state            function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only            enthalpy changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes            that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical            changes), the enthalpy change (\xceH) is:
The mathematical product P\xceV represents            work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By            their definitions, the arithmetic signs of \xceV and w will always be opposite:
Substituting this equation into the enthalpy-change equation yields:
From definition of internal energy, \xceE = q + w, we then get:
Where the subscript on heat, qp , is included to            specify that this is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
If a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the                  only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow                  (qp) and enthalpy change (\xceH) for the process are                      equal.
for processes occurring at constant pressure.
The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of            the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially            constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction            measured in a bomb calorimeter, as discussed previously, is not equal to \xceH because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents            expansion work from occurring. Chemists usually perform experiments under normal            atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure where q =                \xceH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for            determining heat.
The following shows how the above conventions apply when we use \xceH for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen gas: :
When 0.0500 mol of HCl(aq) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(aq) to form 0.0500 mol of                NaCl(aq), 2.9 kJ of heat is produced. What is \xceH for the following reaction, corresponding to the enthalpy                change per mole of acid reacting?
For the reaction of 0.0500 mol HCl acid, q = .9 kJ. This                leads us to the ratio                                                                        .9 kJ                            0.0500 mol HCl                                                            Which can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1                mole of HCl reacts:
The enthalpy change when 1 mole of HCl reacts is therefore  kJ. Since in the                chemical equation, one mole of HCl reacts, we write the enthalpy of the reaction as:
The following example illustrates that you need to take both stoichiometry and limiting            reactants into account when determining the \xceH for a chemical            reaction.
A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C12H22O11.                When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO3, 43.7 kJ of heat is                produced. Determine the enthalpy change for the reaction.

Moles of KClO3 available:

is needed, C12H22O11 is the excess reactant and                    KClO3 is the limiting reactant. Because all of the KClO3 reacts, we                can say that 43.7 kJ of heat is produced when 7.19 g of KClO3 reacts.

87,475,477,78,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Calculating Formal Charge,"Previously, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. However, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept of formal chargescharge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons) to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.
charge that would result on an atom by taking the number of valence electrons on the neutral atom and subtracting the nonbonding electrons and the number of bonds (one-half of the bonding electrons)
The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.
Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:
Formal Charge
We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure. The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should equal the charge of the ion.
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule. Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.

88,257,258,46,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Chemical Equations,"The chemical equation on the previous page is a balanced equation, meaning that equal            numbers of atoms for each element involved in the reaction are represented on the            reactant and product sides.
This is a requirement the equation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of            conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on            either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that            the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of            any formula containing that element by the elements subscript in the formula. If an            element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the number of            atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both            product species in the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the            element oxygen. To determine the total number of oxygen atoms on the product side we add            the 2 atoms of oxygen in the CO2 molecule to the 2 atoms of oxygen in the 2                H2O moleucles for a total of 4 oxygen atoms.
The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and            water is confirmed to be balanced per this approach, as shown here:
Indicate whether the following equations are balanced or unbalanced.
Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N2) and                oxygen (O2) to form dinitrogen pentoxide.
First, write the unbalanced equation.
Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.
Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number                of oxygen atoms. To balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt                would be to change the coefficients for the O2 and                    N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least                common multiple for the O atom subscripts in these two formulas).
The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the                coefficient for the reactant N2 to 2.
The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the                equation is balanced.

It is sometimes convenient to use fractions instead of integers as intermediate            coefficients in the process of balancing a chemical equation. When balance is achieved,            all the equations coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole number to convert the            fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example,            consider the reaction of ethane (C2H6) with oxygen to yield                H2O and CO2 , represented by the unbalanced equation:
Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by            changing the coefficients for the two product species, as shown:
This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd numberno            integer coefficient can be used with the O2 reactant to yield an odd number,            so a fractional coefficient, 7/2, is used instead to yield a provisional balanced            equation:
A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying            each coefficient by 2:
Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the            smallest whole-number coefficients. Although the equation for the reaction between            molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to produce ammonia is, indeed, balanced,
the coefficients are not the smallest possible integers representing the relative numbers            of reactant and product molecules. Dividing each coefficient by the greatest common            factor, 3, gives the preferred equation:
The physical states of reactants and products in chemical equations very often                    are indicated with a parenthetical abbreviation following the formulas. Common                    abbreviations include s for solids, l for liquids, g for gases, and aq for                    substances dissolved in water (aqueous solutions, as introduced in the preceding                    chapter). These notations are illustrated in the example equation here:
This equation represents the reaction that takes place when sodium metal is                    placed in water. The solid sodium reacts with liquid water to produce molecular                    hydrogen gas and the ionic compound sodium hydroxide (a solid in pure form, but                    readily dissolved in water).
Special conditions necessary for a reaction are sometimes designated by writing a                    word or symbol above or below the equations arrow. For example, a reaction                    carried out by heating may be indicated by the uppercase Greek letter delta (\xce)                    over the arrow.
Other examples of these special conditions will be encountered in more depth                    later in the course.

A standard enthalpy of formation,                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                , of a pure substance is the enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1            mole of that substance is formed from the elements in their most stable states under            standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or            predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to            carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have            values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the            enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hesss            law.
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is .5 kJ/mol. This is the            enthalpy change for the reaction that forms CO2(g) from the elements:
The reactants are the elements in their cstandard statesd, which is the most stable form            of the element at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 C. For the element carbon, the standard            state is graphite, because this is the most stable form of carbon under at 1 atm and 25            C. For oxygen, the standard state is O2(g). The product of the formation            reaction is one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 C. For nitrogen dioxide,                NO2(g),                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                                     is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
A reaction equation with 1/2 mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is            correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole            of product, NO2(g).
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in            this  Table of Thermodynamic Properties. These values indicate that            formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as  kJ/mol for the formation            of P4O10) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the            formation of acetylene, C2H2). Note that the standard enthalpy of            formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero.
Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic                process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction                in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the                reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation,                                                                \xce                                                    H                            f                            o                                                                                     of ozone from the following information:

90,794,797,111,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Hess\'s Law,"There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure            it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy            changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make            accurate measurements difficult to carry out experimentally. And even when a reaction is            not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat            involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.
Hesss law allows us to relate the enthalpies of different reactions.
If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the                    enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of                    the various steps.
Hesss law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only            on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to            finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon            dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is            written:
We can also consider a two-step process, where first carbon monoxide is formed in the            first step:
In the second step, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical            changes:
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:
According to Hesss law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the            enthalpy changes of the steps. Because, in this case, the first two steps are combustion            reactions, we can use the enthalpies of combustion found on the table on page:                Enthalpies of                Combustion to find the enthalpy change of the entire reaction from            its two steps:
The result is shown in the diagram below. We see that \xceH of the            overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall                \xceH for the reaction = sum of \xceH            values for reaction cstepsd in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and            physical processes.
Before we further practice using Hesss law, let us recall two important features of \xceH.
\xceH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or            products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of                NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ :
When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the \xceH            will be twice as large:
In general, if we multiply (or divide) an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change            should also be multiplied (or divided) by the same number.
\xceH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and            opposite in sign to \xceH for the reaction in the reverse            direction. For example, given that:
Then, for the creversed reaction, the enthalpy change is also creversedd:
Determine the enthalpy of formation, \xceHf of                    FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process                that occurs under standard state conditions:
We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s),                which is equal to \xceH for the reaction:
Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find \xceH is the sum of the two reactions with known \xceH values, so we must sum their \xceHs:
The enthalpy of formation, \xceHf, of                    FeCl3(s) is .5 kJ/mol.
Many times the given steps do not add up to the equation in question and some            manipulation of the equations is required. Here we will look at some such examples.
Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:
Use the reactions here to determine the \xceH for reaction (i):
Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they                add up to reaction (i). Going from left to right in (i), we first see that ClF(g) is                needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (iii) by 1/2,                which means that the \xceH change is also multiplied by 1/2:
Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse                and halve reaction (ii), which means that the \xceH changes sign and is halved:
To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of \xceH:
Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

Thus, theratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by thecoefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes aremeasured at the same temperature and pressure.
We can extend Avogadros law (that thevolume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) tochemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simpleproportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the sametemperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases reactto produce ammonia gas according to N2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) f 2 (g), a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three timesthat volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, ifpressure and temperature remain constant.

Propane, C3H8(g), is used in gas grills to provide the heat for cooking. What volume of (g) measured at 25 C and 760 torr is required to reactwith 2.7 L of propane measured under the same conditions of temperature andpressure? Assume that the propane undergoes complete combustion.
The ratio of the volumes ofH 8 and O2 will be equal to the ratioof their coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction:
From the equation, we see that onevolume of C3H8 will react with five volumes of O2 :

A volume of 13.5 L of O2will be required to react with 2.7 L of C3H8 .
Not all reactions involving gases takeplace at STP or under constant conditions. In such cases, it may be necessary tocombine stoichiometry techniques with gas laws. Let's take a look at somesuch problems.
What volume of hydrogen at 27 C and torr may be prepared by the reaction of 8.88 g of gallium with an excessof hydrochloric acid?
Note that in a similar problem above weused the molar volume of a gas (22.4 L) to make this calculation. This willnot work here because the reaction does not occur at STP.
To convert from mass of gallium tovolume of H2 (g) we will follow a similar process initially tofind the mol of H2 (g) produced. Then apply the ideal gasequation to find the volume of H2 (g) at the given temperatureand pressure. The steps of the process are seen below:

When ions are involved in these reactions, the            chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail appropriate to their            intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking            place in an aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and                AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous                Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl:
This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation            because it doesnt explicitly represent the ionic species that are present in solution.            When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate into their constituent ions,            which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a            thorough discussion of this important process is provided later in the course). Ionic            compounds dissolved in water are, therefore, more realistically represented as            dissociated ions, in this case:
Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant            extent, as signified by its physical state notation, s.
Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this            particular case, the formulas for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas            for their dissociated ions:

In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high            temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield            gaseous products of known identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for            example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only products. The gaseous            combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing            compounds that selectively absorb each product, as shown in the figure below. The mass            increase of each device corresponds to the mass of the absorbed product and may be used            in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the relevant            element.
This schematic diagram illustrates the                basic components of a combustion analysis device for determining the carbon and                hydrogen content of a sample.
Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to                produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic items. A combustion                analysis of a 0.00126 g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2                and 0.00161 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?
The primary assumption in this exercise is that                all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon dioxide, and all the                hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:
{\\mathrm C}_x{\\mathrm                H}_y\\mathit(s\\mathit)+excess\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)\\longrightarrow                x\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)+\\frac y2\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O(g)\\;\\;
Note that a balanced equation is not necessary                for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the compound, only the                subscripts x and y are needed.
First, calculate the molar amounts of carbon                and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the carbon dioxide and                water, respectively. With these molar amounts, the empirical formula for the                compound may be written as described in an earlier unit.

96,722,724,103,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Physical Processes,"One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical            process is known as calorimetryprocess of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat            transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated            object (calorimeterdevice used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter            is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to            establish the calorimeters heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach            requires the definition of a systemportion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical            or physical change) and its surroundingsall matter other than the system being studied (the other components of the measurement            apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the            system). Knowledge of the heat capacity of the surroundings, and careful measurements of            the masses of the system and surroundings and their temperatures before and after the            process allows one to calculate the heat transferred as described in this section.

all matter other than the system being studied
A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or            physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a            calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which            increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is            absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature. The            temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be            used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.
Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat            between the calorimeter and its environment. This enables the accurate determination of            the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General            chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups.            These easy-to-use ccoffee cupd calorimeters allow more heat exchange with their            surroundings, and therefore produce less accurate energy values, but for the purposes of            a general chemistry student are accurate enough.
Before we practice calorimetry problems involving chemical reactions, consider a simpler            example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry.

If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two            substances (in this example the water and the metal), with no heat gained or lost by            either the calorimeter or the calorimeters surroundings. Under these ideal            circumstances, the net heat change is zero:
This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by the metal is equal to            the heat lost the water:
The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the            negative sign merely shows that qmetal and qwater are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain            or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic sign of either q            value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per            definition). In the specific situation described, qmetal is a negative value and qwater is positive, since heat is transferred from the metal to the            water.
A 248 g piece of copper is dropped into 392 mL of water at 22.6 C in a coffee cup                calorimeter. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 C. Calculate                the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs                between the copper and the water. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g C.
The temperature of the water increases from 22.6 C to 39.9 C, so the water absorbs                heat. That heat came from the piece of copper, which initially was at a higher                temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the copper and the water,                with no heat clostd to the surroundings, then heat given off by the copper = heat                taken in by water, or:
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:
Letting f = final and i = initial, in                expanded form, this becomes:
The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 392 mL of water = 392 g. Noting that the final                temperature of both the copper and water is 39.9 C, substituting known values                yields:
Rearranging to solve for Ti,copper:
Solving this gives Ti,copper = 337 C, so the initial temperature of the                copper was 337 C.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of            an unknown metal.
A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly                transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 C in a calorimeter. The final                temperature is 28.5 C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal.                Use this result to identify the metal.
Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,                or:
                qmetal = qwater
In expanded form, this is:
Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was            100.0 C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:
Rearranging the equation to solve for cmetal:
Comparing this with values in the table on page ""Heat Capacity and Specific Heat"" , our            experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g C), so we identify the metal as copper.","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to see the example progress.","Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,                or:","Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,                or: heat is taken in by water?",1,1,0.0,29.827884674072266
97,1077,1081,152,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The van der Waals Equation,"The ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas            molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable            part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure            and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and            deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregardedthis is,            however, is not always the case.
In 1879, the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals developed an equation which corrects            for the attraction between gas particles and their volume. Under certain conditions of            high pressure and low temperatures the deviations from ideal gas law are significant and            the van der Waals equation should be used to accurately determine characteristics of a            sample of gas.
The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one                to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces                between them.
The constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a            particular gas, and the constant b corresponds to the volume of the molecules of a            particular gas. The ccorrectiond to the pressure term in the ideal gas law is                (n2a)/v2, and the ccorrectiond to the volume is nb. Note that            when V is relatively large and n is relatively small, both of these correction terms            become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV =            nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules            is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure.            Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some common gases are given in            table below.
At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than            the one for molecular volume, b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for            the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are            incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some            intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears            to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This            behavior is reflected by the cdipsd in the graph seen below that we looked at earlier.            The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an            ideal gas, as pressure is raised. At very high pressures, the gas becomes less            compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly            significant fraction of the total gas volume.
Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions            between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an            appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of            low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave            ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be            disregardedthis is, however, very often not the case.
A 4.25-L flask contains 3.46 mol CO2 at 229 C. Calculate the pressure of                this sample of CO2:

(c) Explain the reason(s) for the difference.
This is not very different from the value from the ideal gas law because the                pressure is not very high and the temperature is not very low. The value is somewhat                different because CO2 molecules do have some volume and attractions                between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or                attractions.

98,893,896,125,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded                    Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram. These diagrams represent each                    orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an                    arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow                    to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate                    two electrons of opposite spin.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created                    orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets                    one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired                    electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap                    during the formation of the BeCl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a                    molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom                    in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in                        Zn(CH3)2, which contains a linear CZnC arrangement,                    and the carbon atom in CO2.
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron                    density consist of a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one                    unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2                    hybridization, the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three                    identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry.
Although quantum mechanics yields the cplumpd orbital lobes as depicted,                    sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor                    lobes, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use                    these cthinnerd representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily                    visualize.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests                        sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is                    trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen                    atoms. We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in                    an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH3 as shown in the                    orbital energy level diagram. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the                    boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron                    pairs with a hydrogen electron when BH bonds form.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit                        sp2 hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on                    the central atom, such as ClNO, or molecules with two single bonds and a double                    bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O.
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of                    bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four sp3 hybrid                    orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p                    orbitals that produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each of                    these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by                    four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane                    exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron                    distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in                    CH4. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed                    equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen                    electron when the CH bonds form.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps                    with one of the four sp3 orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma                    () bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent                    bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the                    methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of                    methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the                    corners of a tetrahedronthree hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. However, in                    ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an                        sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form a  bond between the                    two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps                    with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen  bonds. The                    structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane. The orientation                    of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other.                    Experimental evidence shows that rotation around  bonds occurs easily.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The                    nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by                    the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen                    atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5, but the                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3) and water (104.5) are slightly smaller.                    Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,                        PCl3, and NCl3.
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid                    orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six                    valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of                    the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not                    those in the first or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five PCl                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the PCl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and                    the chlorine atoms in ClF3 and in ClF4+. (The                    electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2                    hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of                    electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no                    lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s                    orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals form six equivalent                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a                    different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in                        PCl6, the iodine atom in the interhalogens                        IF6+, IF5, ICl4,                        IF4 and the xenon atom in XeF4.
Ammonium sulfate is important as a fertilizer. What is the hybridization of                        the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion, SO42?
The Lewis structure of sulfate shows there are four regions of electron                        density. The hybridization is sp3.

99,694,696,101,Solids and Liquids,The Solid State of Matter,BCC and FCC Unit Cells,"Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of            unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells: simple cubic (which we have            already seen), body-centered cubic unit cell, and face-centered cubic unit cellall of which are            illustrated in the figure below. (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems,            some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit            cells. We leave the more complicated geometries for later in this module.)
Cubic unit cells of metals show (in the upper                figures) the locations of lattice points and (in the lower figures) metal atoms located in the                unit cell.
Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a            cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the center, as shown in the            figure below. This is called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corners of a BCC            unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains            two atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom from            the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom in this structure touches four atoms in the            layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC structure has a            coordination number of eight.
In a body-centered cubic structure, atoms in a                specific layer do not touch each other. Each atom touches four atoms in the layer above it and                four atoms in the layer below it.
Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently            packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68% of the total volume. Isomorphous            metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature. (Elements or            compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous.)
Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead,            crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and at            the centers of each face, as illustrated in the figure below. This arrangement is called a            face-centered cubic (FCC) solid. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at            each of the eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom            on each of the six faces (\\(6\imes\\\;=3\\) atoms from the faces). The atoms at the corners            touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of the cube.            Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.
A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the                corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the faces of its unit cells.
Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely            together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume. This structure is also called cubic            closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms.            Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer            below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination            number of 12. The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately            obvious, but why they are actually the same structure is illustrated below.
A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating                layers (ABCABC) of hexagonally arranged atoms. Atoms in a CCP structure have a coordination                number of 12 because they contact six atoms in their layer, plus three atoms in the layer above                and three atoms in the layer below. By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP                structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from                layer B across a diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from                layer C at the remaining corner. This is the same as a face-centered cubic                arrangement.
Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions            between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in            this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic crystalline structures: CCP,            which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in the following            figure. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second            layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact            with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP,            atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the first layer (i.e., the third layer is            also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed layers            (i.e., ABABABb\xaf). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two            layers (i.e., the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type            B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e., ABCABCABCb\xaf). About twothirds of all metals crystallize            in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of 12. Metals that crystallize in an HCP            structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a CCP structure            include Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt.
In both types of closest packing, atoms are                packed as compactly as possible. Hexagonal closest packing consists of two alternating layers                (ABABAB). Cubic closest packing consists of three alternating layers                (ABCABCABC).
Calcium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure.                The edge length of its unit cell is 558.8 pm.
(a) What is the atomic radius of Ca in this structure?
(b) Calculate the density of Ca.
(a) In an FCC structure, Ca atoms contact each other                across the diagonal of the face, so the length of the diagonal is equal to four Ca atomic radii                (d = 4r).
Two adjacent edges and the diagonal of the face form a                right triangle, with the length of each side equal to 558.8 pm and the length of the hypotenuse                equal to four Ca atomic radii:
\\mathrm a^2+\\mathrm a^2=\\mathrm                d^2\\longrightarrow{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2+{(558.5\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2=(4\\mathrm r)^2\\;
Solving this gives for a Ca radius.
r\\;=\\;\\sqrt{\\frac{{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2\\;+\\;{(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm})}^2\\;}{16}}=197.6\\;\\mathrm{pm}
(b) Density is given by \\(                density\\;=\\;\\frac{mass}{volume} \\) . The density of calcium can be found by determining the                density of its unit cell: for example, the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the                volume of the unit cell. A face-centered Ca unit cell has one-eighth of an atom at each of the                eight corners (\\(8\imes\\\;=1\\) atom) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces                \\(6\imes\\\;=3\\) atoms), for a total of four atoms in the unit cell.
The mass of the unit cell can be found by:
1\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}\\;\imes\\frac{4\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{atom}}{1\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{unit}\\;\\mathrm{cell}}\imes\\frac{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm{Ca}}{6.022\\;\imes\\;10^{23}\\;\\mathrm{Ca}\\;\\mathrm{atoms}}\imes\\frac{40.078\\;\\mathrm                g}{1\\;\\mathrm{mol}\\;\\mathrm {Ca}}=2.662\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm g
The volume of a Ca unit cell can be found by:
V\\;=\\;a^3\\;=\\;\\left(558.8\\;\\mathrm{pm}\imes\\frac{10^{-10}\\;\\mathrm{cm}}{1\\;\\mathrm{pm}}\ight)^3\\;=\\;1.745\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3
(Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm                to get the usual volume units for density.)
Then, the density of Ca is:
\\mathrm{density}\\;=\\;\\frac{2.662\\;\imes\\;10^{-22}\\;\\mathrm                g}{1.745\\;\^{-22}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^3}\\;=\\;1.53\\;\\mathrm g/\\mathrm{cm}^3\\;
In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of            three axes (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between them, as illustrated below. The            axes are defined as being the lengths between points in the space lattice. Consequently, unit            cell axes join points with identical environments.
A cube is shown where each corner has a black dot drawn            on it. A circle in the bottom of the cube is composed of three double-ended arrows. The left top            of this circle is labeled calpha,d the top right is labeled cbetad and the bottom is labeled            cgamma.d The bottom left corner of the cube is labeled cad while the bottom of the back face is            labeled cbd and the top, back, left corner is labeled cc.d
A unit cell is defined by the lengths of its three axes            (a, b, and c) and the angles (\xce, \xce, and \xce) between the axes. There are seven different lattice            systems, some of which have more than one type of lattice, for a total of fourteen different unit            cells, which have the shapes shown below.
