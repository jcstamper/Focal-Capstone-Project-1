0,116,124,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Clausius-Clapeyron Equation,"The quantitative relation between a substances            vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
P\\;=\\;Ae^{-\\Delta H_{vap}/RT}
where \xceHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization for the            liquid, R is the gas constant, and A is a constant whose value depends on the chemical            identity of the substance. Temperature T must be in Kelvin in this equation. This            equation is often rearranged into logarithmic form to yield the linear equation:
\\ln\\;P\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT}+\\;\\ln\\;A
This linear equation may be expressed in a            two-point format that is convenient for use in various computations, as demonstrated in            the example exercises that follow. If at temperature T1, the vapor pressure            is P1, and at temperature T2, the vapor pressure is P2,            the corresponding linear equations are:
\\ln\\;P_1\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT_1}+\\;\\ln\\;A\\; \ext{and} \\;\\ln\\;P_2\\;=\\;-\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT_2}+\\;\\ln\\;A
Since the constant, A, is the same, these two            equations may be rearranged to isolate ln A and then set them equal to one another:
\\ln\\;P_1\\;\\;+\\;\\frac{\\Delta            H_{vap}}{RT_1}\\;=\\;\\ln\\;P_2\\;\\;+\\;\\frac{\\Delta H_{vap}}{RT_2}\\;

Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) has an                octane rating of 100. It is used as one of the standards for the octane-rating                system for gasoline. At 34.0 C, the vapor pressure of isooctane is 10.0 kPa, and at                98.8 C, its vapor pressure is 100.0 kPa. Use this information to estimate the                enthalpy of vaporization for isooctane.
The enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap,                can be determined by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta                H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\ight)
Since we have two vapor pressure-temperature                values (T1 = 34.0 C = 307.2 K, P1 = 10.0 kPa and                T2 = 98.8 C = 372.0 K, P2 = 100 kPa), we can substitute                them into this equation and solve for \xceHvap. Rearranging the                Clausius-Clapeyron equation and solving for \xceHvap yields:
\\Delta                H_{vap}=\\frac{R\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{P_2}{P_1}}\ight)}{\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\ight)}=\\;\\frac{(8.314\\;\\mathrm                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm                K)\\cdot\\ln\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{100.\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}{10.0\\;\\mathrm{kPa}}}\ight)}{\\left(\{307.2\\;\\mathrm                K}-\{372.0\\;\\mathrm K}\ight)}\\;=33,800\\;\\mathrm                J/\\mathrm{mol}\\;=\\;33.8\\;\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{mol}
Note that the pressure can be in any units, so                long as they agree for both P values, but the temperature must be in kelvin for the                Clausius-Clapeyron equation to be valid.
For benzene (C6H6), the                normal boiling point is 80.1 C and the enthalpy of vaporization is 30.8 kJ/mol.                What is the boiling point of benzene in Denver, where atmospheric pressure = 83.4                kPa?
Solution
If the temperature and vapor pressure are known                at one point, along with the enthalpy of vaporization, \xceHvap, then the temperature                that corresponds to a different vapor pressure (or the vapor pressure that                corresponds to a different temperature) can be determined by using the                Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
\\ln\\;\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\Delta                H_{vap}}R\\left(\{T_1}-\{T_2}\ight)
Since the normal boiling point is the                temperature at which the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure at sea level, we                know one vapor pressure-temperature value (T1 = 80.1 C = 353.3 K,                P1 = 101.3 kPa, \xceHvap = 30.8 kJ/mol) and want to find the                temperature (T2) that corresponds to vapor pressure P2 = 83.4                kPa. We can substitute these values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and then                solve for T2. Rearranging the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and solving for                T2 yields:

1,182,197,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Module Summary and Quiz,"Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called                    the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An                    aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a                    solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of                    solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very                    useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter                    of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding                    solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple                    relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after                    dilution.
In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used                    in various applications. Percentage concentrations based on the solution                    components masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high                    concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using                    ppm or ppb units. These units are popular in environmental, medical, and other                    fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly used.

2,10,10,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Module Summary and Quiz,"Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry.                Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be                represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use the SI (International System)                or metric systems. We use base SI units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units,                such as liters (for volume) and g/cm3 (for density). In many cases, we find it convenient to use unit prefixes                that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10-6 seconds) and megahertz (106 hertz),                respectively.
Quantities can be exact or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number                of significant figures in the measurement. The uncertainty of a calculated value depends on the uncertainties in                the values used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Measured values can be accurate                (close to the true value) and/or precise (showing little variation when measured repeatedly).
Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured                quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors,                which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or                dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured                quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.

3,164,179,Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Colloids,"Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly            basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3, from            wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain            carboxylic acids). When animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or            sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic            acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic            acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and            contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the C17H35            unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the  CO2 unit (shown below).
Soaps contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon                end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end is a carboxylate group. The                length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from soap to soap.
Detergents (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar            hydrocarbon chains, such as C12H25, and an ionic group, such as a            sulfate, or a sulfonate (such            as the detergent shown below). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium compounds in            hard water; detergents form water-soluble productsa definite advantage for            detergents.
Detergents contain a nonpolar                hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be either a                sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from                detergent to detergent.
The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be            explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved. The hydrocarbon            (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to,            nonpolar substances such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted            by water (polar), illustrated in the following figure. As a result, the soap or            detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the            water so they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar            and polar. Molecules such as this are termed amphiphilic since they have both a            hydrophobic (cwater-fearingd) part and a hydrophilic (cwater-lovingd) part. As a            consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily            washed away.
This diagrammatic cross section of an                emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent acts as an                emulsifier.
Dispersed colloidal particles are often            electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example, does not            contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the            iron(III) ions. Thus, each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and            the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal particles and some free hydroxide            ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids have            positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged            dispersions. All colloidal particles in any one system have charges of the same sign.            This helps keep them dispersed because particles containing like charges repel each            other.
The charged nature of some colloidal particles may            be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For example, the particles            comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick            Cottrell, an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The            charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes, where they are neutralized            and deposited as dust, such as in the Cottrell precipitator shown below. This is one of            the important methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes.            The process is also important in the recovery of valuable products from the smoke and            flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar electrostatic air            filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.
In a Cottrell precipitator, positively                and negatively charged particles are attracted to highly charged electrodes,                where they are neutralized and deposited as dust.
Gelatin desserts, such as Jell-O, are a type of            colloid. Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous mixture of gelatin coagulates            as it cools, yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal            dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a solid phase. It appears that the fibers of the            dispersing medium form a complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled            with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the dispersing medium.
Gelatin desserts are colloids in which                an aqueous solution of sweeteners and flavors is dispersed throughout a medium                of solid proteins. (credit photo: modification of work by Steven                Depolo)
Pectin, a carbohydrate from fruit juices, is a            gel-forming substance important in jelly making. Silica gel, a colloidal dispersion of            hydrated silicon dioxide, is formed when dilute hydrochloric acid is added to a dilute            solution of sodium silicate.

4,57,60,Gases,Gas Laws,Measuring Gas Pressure,"We can measure atmospheric pressure, theforce exerted by the atmosphere on the earths surface, with a barometer. Abarometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatileliquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of thatliquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, thecolumn of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquidsurface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in thetube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.
If the liquid is water, normal atmosphericpressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is ratherinconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury (Hg) is about.6-times denser than water, a mercury barometer only needs to be .6 as tall as a water barometera more suitable size. Standardatmospheric pressure of 1 atm at sea level (101,325 Pa) corresponds to a columnof mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high.
A manometer is a device similar to abarometer that can be used to measure the pressure of a gas trapped in acontainer. An open-end manometer is a U-shaped tube with one arm open to theatmosphere, one arm that connects to the gas to be measured, and a nonvolatileliquid (usually mercury) in between. The distance between the liquid levelscorresponds to the difference in pressure between the gas in the container andthe atmosphere.
Calculate the pressure of the gas in the manometer pictured below in units ofkPa. Atmospheric pressure is determined to be 100.5 kPa.
In order to use the equation Pgas = Patm  h, the height and the atmosphericpressure need to be in the same units. Since we want our final answer inunits of kPa, we will convert 53 mmHg to kPa and then use the equation.
Now we can apply the equation:

5,20,21,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Early Atomic Theory,"The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers,             the scientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was             composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for cindivisible.d             They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later,             Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four celementsdfire,             earth, air, and waterand could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and celementsd             as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.
The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John             Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic             theory. First published in 1807, many of Daltons hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern             atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Daltons atomic theory.
Daltons atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that youve             learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken             down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither             created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one             type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).

6,190,205,Solutions,Solubility,Module Summary and Quiz,"A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that            is homogeneous at the molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component            and determines the physical state of the solution. The solutes are the other components            typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may form            endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and            solvent intermolecular attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable            change in energy.
Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may            be covalent compounds that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example,            acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds that dissociate to yield their            constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is            facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar            water molecules. Soluble ionic substances and strong acids ionize completely and are            strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only a small extent and are            weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when            dissolved in water.
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several            factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces            that may exist between the substances atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to            dissolve is quantified as a substances solubility, its maximum concentration in a            solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute            at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a            solutes concentration exceeds its solubilitya nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that            will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed.            Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low            mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing            temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.            The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial            pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henrys            law.

7,101,106,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,The Nuclear Atom,"The next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a            physicist from New Zealand who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and            England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of high-speed, positively            charged alpha particlespositively charged particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons (\xce particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of            radium; \xce particles consist of two protons and two neutrons. Rutherford and his            colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest Marsden aimed a            beam of \xce particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of            the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering            of the \xce particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an \xce            particle.

What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being            deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were            deflected almost straight back toward the source.
Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving \xce particles passed            through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty            space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when            they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like            charges repel one another, the few positively charged \xce particles that changed paths            abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly            concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the            time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing            a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:
This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very            small, positively charged nucleus, in which most of the mass of the atom is            concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the atom is            electrically neutral. He named this fundamental particle the protonPositively charged subatomic particle located in the nucleus of the atom., the positively            charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will            learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used            today.

The image in the activity below represents a close-up diagram of Rutherford\'s gold                foil experiment. Drag the description of the observation that Rutherford made to the                place on the diagram that represents that observation.
One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom,            with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different            proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the            existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged            particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found            evidence of neutronsuncharged, subatomic particle located in the nucleus, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same            as that of protons.

8,0,0,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Introduction,Introduction to Composition of Substances and Solutions,"Swimming pools have long been a popular means of recreation, exercise, and physical            therapy. Since it is impractical to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent            basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent the growth of harmful            bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various            chemical compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of            calcium ion, Ca2+, in the water should be maintained within certain limits to prevent            eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To maintain proper calcium            levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that            also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of Ca2+ in            the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium            level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances (such as the            calcium-containing compound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of            this unit.",,what should be kept in the pool according to the text?,1,0,0.0,90.21105194091795
9,50,53,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Heating and Cooling Curves,"In the unit on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or            released by a substance, q, and its accompanying temperature            change, \xceT, was introduced:
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,            but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a            temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat            is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of            increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a            change in state, its temperature remains constant.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply            heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the waters            temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant            despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is            maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to            provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the            boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase            transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state            is in progress.
The slide show below shows the change in temperature that occurs when a constant source            of heat is added to ice with an initial temperature of -10.0 oC. The resulting graph is            known as a heating curve.
How much heat is required to convert 135 g of ice at  C into water vapor at 120                C?
The transition described involves the following steps:
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in                phase) is: q = m  c  \xceT (see previous chapter on                thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given by q = n  \xceH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water,                and steam, and enthalpies of fusion and vaporization, we have:
Converting the quantities in J to kJ permits them to be summed, yielding the total                heat required:
The values below for water are used in the following example:
Calculate the heat required to convert 25.0 g solid ethanol at -135.0 oC                to liquid at 72.0 oC. Specific heat of solid ethanol = 0.97 J/g                    oC. Specific heat liquid ethanol 2.3 J/ g oC.
\xceHfus of ethanol = 4.9 kJ/mol

10,27,28,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Introduction to Aqueous Solutions,"In preceding sections, we focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter            that contain only one type of element or compound. However, mixturessamples of matter            containing two or more substances physically combinedare more commonly encountered in            nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition            of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount            of oxygen in a planets atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The            relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known            as an calloyd) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative            amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving            the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage            determines its sweetness. In this section, we will describe one of the most common ways            in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.
We have previously defined solutions as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the                    composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout                    its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been                    implemented in many forms of man-made technology. Here we will introduce some of                    the basic properties of solutions.
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration.                    Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentrationquantitative measure of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present in a solution                    that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component                    is called the solventsolution component present in a concentration that is higher relative to other components and may be viewed as the medium in which the other                    components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent                    are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the                    solvent is called an aqueous solutionsolution for which water is the solvent. Water has the ability to dissolve many                    different types of substances. Because of this, it is often referred to as the                    universal solvent.

A solutesolution component present in a concentration less than that of the solvent is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower                    concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with                    qualitative terms such as dilutequalitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively low concentration (of relatively low concentration) and                    concentratedqualitative term for a solution containing solute at a relatively high concentration (of relatively high concentration).

11,61,65,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,The Mole,"The moleamount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12 is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It            provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of            matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing the same number of            discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a            sample of pure 12C weighing exactly 12 g. The mole provides                a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely                important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.
amount of substance containing the same number of atoms, molecules, ions, or other entities as the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of C-12
The number of entities composing a mole is defined to be            6.02214179×1023, a fundamental constant named Avogadros number                (NA)defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo            Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of cper mole,d a            conveniently rounded version being 6.022×1023/mol.
defined value of the number of entities comprising 1 mole of substance, equal to 6.022  1023 per mole
Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the            same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. For example 1 mole of carbon            contains 6.022×1023 atoms of carbon and 1 mole of phosphorus contains 6.022×1023             atoms of phosphorus. The masses of 1 mole of different elements,            however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically            different. The molar massmass in grams of 1 mole of a substance of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of            that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). Because the            definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference            substance, 12C, the molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to            its atomic or formula weight in amu. The molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol (same value            as its atomic mass) and the molar mass of phosphorus is 30.97 g/mol (same value as its            atomic mass).
mass in grams of 1 mole of a substance
While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are            vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the            magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the            mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g. Although this represents            just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (approximately 18 g), it contains more water            molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among            the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100            billion molecules.
As we discussed, the molar mass of an element is numerically the same value as                    the atomic mass of that element listed on the periodic table. Likewise, the                    molar mass of a compound is numerically the same value as the formula mass for                    that compound. For example, the formula mass of NaCl is 58.44 amu. Therefore the                    molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g and the number of NaCl units is 6.022×1023.                         The formula mass of water H2O is 18.02 amu.                    Therefore the molar mass of water is 18.02 g and the number of water molecules                    in one mole of water is 6.022×1023.
*Note that one unit of a molecular(covalent) compound is referred to as a                    molecule. However, one unit of a ionic compound is referred to as a formula                    unit.

13,118,126,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Combustion Analysis,"The elemental composition of hydrocarbons and            related compounds may be determined via a gravimetric method known as combustion            analysis. In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high            temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield            gaseous products of known identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for            example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only products. The gaseous            combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing            compounds that selectively absorb each product, as shown in the figure below. The mass            increase of each device corresponds to the mass of the absorbed product and may be used            in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the relevant            element.
This schematic diagram illustrates the                basic components of a combustion analysis device for determining the carbon and                hydrogen content of a sample.
Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to                produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic items. A combustion                analysis of a 0.00126 g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2                and 0.00161 g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?
The primary assumption in this exercise is that                all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon dioxide, and all the                hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:
{\\mathrm C}_x{\\mathrm                H}_y\\mathit(s\\mathit)+excess\\;{\\mathrm O}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)\\longrightarrow                x\\;{\\mathrm{CO}}_2\\mathit(g\\mathit)+\\frac y2\\;{\\mathrm H}_2\\mathrm O(g)\\;\\;
Note that a balanced equation is not necessary                for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the compound, only the                subscripts x and y are needed.
First, calculate the molar amounts of carbon                and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the carbon dioxide and                water, respectively. With these molar amounts, the empirical formula for the                compound may be written as described in an earlier unit. An outline of this                approach is given in the following flow chart:

14,36,38,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP),"The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most            fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely            regarded as the cfather of modern chemistry,d changed chemistry from a qualitative to a            quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation            of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the            composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He            was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death,            mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, cIt took the mob only a moment            to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.

However, we can also answer this question            another way: with volumes of gases. We can use the ideal gas equation to relate the            pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas. Here we will combine the            ideal gas equation with other equations to find gas density and molar mass. We will deal            with mixtures of different gases, and calculate amounts of substances in reactions            involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will            provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already            discussed.

We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of                    molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and                    temperature.

We can calculate the molar volume of a gas by using the ideal gas law.
What is the volume of 1.00 mol of He at a pressure of 1.00 atm and 273.15                        K?
\equire{cancel} V = \\frac{(1.00 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.08206                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(273.15 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1.00                            \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}} = 22.4 \\mathrm{L}
Recognize that the answer in the above example would have been the same                    regardless of the type of gas identified in the problem. 1 mole of ANY gas at                    STP has a volume of This provides a simple conversion factor to use in                    situations when gases are at STP.
A 4.9 g sample of methane, CH4, gas is at standard temperature and                        pressure. What volume does the sample occupy?
Notice here that the amount of gas is given in grams. We will need to convert                        from grams to moles and then use the relationship between moles and volume                        of gas at STP to convert to volume.
\\mathrm{g} \ightarrow \\mathrm{mol} \ightarrow                            \\mathrm{L}
4.9 \\mathrm{\\cancel{g\\ CH_4}} \imes \\frac{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\                            CH_4}}}{16.05 \\cancel{\\mathrm{g\\ CH_4}}} \imes \\frac{22.4 \\mathrm{L\\                            CH_4}}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol\\ CH_4}}} = 6.84 \\mathrm{L}
The molar volume of a gas can also be applied to more complex stoichiometry                    problems involving reactions. We can add volume of gases to our stoichiometry                    flowchart that we saw earlier.
Most metals react with acid to produce hydrogen gas. Zinc reacts with                        hydrochloric acid according to the reactions below.
5.8 g of zinc is reacted with an excess amount hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen                        gas produced is collected at STP. What is the volume of the hydrogen                        gas?
We will use the following steps to solve this problem according to our                        flowchart above:

15,24,25,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Formula Mass,"Earlier we described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of averageatomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup ofsubstances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substancesformula.
For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atomscomposing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may becorrectly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic andnow primarily used in the production of the canti-stickd polymer, Teflon. Themolecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains onecarbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecularmass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the averageatomic masses of these atoms. The table below outlines the calculations used toderive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.

Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and theactive ingredient in several popular nonprescription pain medications, such as Adviland Motrin. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound?
Molecules of this compound are comprised of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2oxygen atoms. Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass forthis compound is therefore:
Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios toyield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compoundis calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: bysumming the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compounds formula.Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not representthe composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred toas the cmolecular mass.d
As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common tablesalt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations,Na+, and chloride anions, Cl, combined in a 1:1ratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu.
Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ioniccompound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various waterpurification processes. What is the formula mass (amu) of this compound?
The formula for this compound indicates it contains Al3+ and ions combined in a 2:3 ratio. For purposesof computing a formula mass, it is helpful to rewrite the formula in thesimpler format, Al2S3O12. Following theapproach outlined above, the formula mass for this compound is calculated asfollows:

16,156,169,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Liquids in Liquids,"We know that some liquids mix with each other in all proportions; in other words, they            have infinite mutual solubility and are said to be miscible. Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and            ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze) are examples of liquids that are            completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline.
Liquids that mix with water in all proportions are usually polar substances or substances            that form hydrogen bonds. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen            bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as            those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds            of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because            there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent,            and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in            polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration            of the chemical axiom clike dissolves like.d
Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible.                    Layers are formed when we pour immiscible liquids into the same container.                    Gasoline, oil, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other                    nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. The attraction between the molecules                    of such nonpolar liquids and polar water molecules is ineffectively weak. The                    only strong attractions in such a mixture are between the water molecules, so                    they effectively squeeze out the molecules of the nonpolar liquid. The                    distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of degrees, so                    that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to                    be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility.
Two liquids, such as bromine and water, that are of moderate mutual solubility are said            to be partially miscible. Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when            mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated            with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is            nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly            discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water            in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine            layer.

17,137,146,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Molecular Structure and Polarity,Module Summary and Quiz,"VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that                    minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone                    pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a                    molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only                    when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment                    measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is                    determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a                    molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond                    moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar                    molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric                    fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.

However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbersbecause most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
average mass of atoms of an element, expressed in amu
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomicmasses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturallyoccurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individualisotopes mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
For example, the element boron is composed of twoisotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10 B with a mass of 10.0129 amu,and the remaining 80.1% are 11 B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The averageatomic mass for boron is calculated to be:
It is important to understand that no single boronatom weighs exactly 10.81 amu; 10.81 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, andindividual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37 Cl (mass 36.96590 amu),with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in termsof these two isotopes?
The average mass of chlorine is the fractionthat is 35 Cl times the mass of 35 Cl plus the fraction thatis 37 Cl times the mass of 37 Cl.
If we let x represent the fraction that is Cl, then the fraction that is 37 Cl is represented by.00  x.
(The fraction that is 35 Cl + thefraction that is 37 Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00  the fraction of 35 Cl.)
Substituting this into the average massequation, we have:
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which meansthat 1.00  0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% 35 Cland 24.24% 37 Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances ofisotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a massspectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics,medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and helpidentify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer(Figure), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beamthat causes the samples atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged,typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a(variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cations path to anextent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of alarge steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extentthan that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of therelative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a massspectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a massspectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specifiedmass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modernatomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis ina wide range of applications.
Based on the information in the massspectra for zirconium in the image above, we can determine that there are 5naturally occurring isotopes of zirconium, Zr, Zr, Zr, Zr, and Zreach with an approximate percent abundance as seen in the table below.

The value of \xceH for a reaction in one direction is                    equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to \xceH for the reaction                    in the opposite direction, and \xceH is directly proportional to                    the quantity of reactants and products.

If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise                    processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy                    changes of the various steps.

The engines of            these rockets rely on carefully prepared solid mixtures of chemicals combined in            precisely measured amounts. Igniting the mixture initiates a vigorous chemical reaction            that rapidly generates large amounts of gaseous products.

21,173,188,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ionic Compounds,"The nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is            the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred between atoms and ions            form, ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is,            the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this            case, cations and anions).
electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound
When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an            element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of            electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is            stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite            charge present in the compound.
For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one            electron to form a sodium cation, Na+, and each chlorine atom in a sample of            chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, Cl,            the resulting compound, NaCl, is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio            of one Na+ ion for each Cl ion. Similarly, each calcium atom            (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to            form CaCl2, which is composed of Ca2+ and Cl ions in            the ratio of one Ca2+ ion to two Cl ions.

A compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic            compoundCompound held together by ionic bonds.. The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic:            When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This            guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds            typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always            true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic).
Compound held together by ionic bonds.
You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are            solids that typically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures.            For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and boils at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the            molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C and AlCl3 melts at 180 °C.) In solid form, an ionic            compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow            (celectricityd is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct            electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid.

22,186,201,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Module Sumamry and Quiz,"Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for                    atoms and monatomic ions) and Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic                    ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple bonds are                    used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a                    Lewis structure. Most structuresespecially those containing second row                    elementsobey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is surrounded by                    eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules                    (free radicals), electron-deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.
In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating                    each bond as if one-half of the electrons are assigned to each atom. These                    hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate                    Lewis structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as                    possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in cases where two or more Lewis                    structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of                    electrons can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance                    hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated by the individual Lewis                    structures (the resonance forms).
The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that                    is, the amount of energy required to break that particular bond in a mole of                    molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same atoms.                    The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required                    to break bonds and the energy released when new bonds are formed.

23,179,194,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Module Summary and Quiz,"A balanced chemical equation may be used to describe a reactions stoichiometry                    (the relationships between amounts of reactants and products). Coefficients from                    the equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that subsequently may be                    used for computations relating reactant and product masses, molar amounts, and                    other quantitative properties.
When reactions are carried out using less-than-stoichiometric quantities of                    reactants, the amount of product generated will be determined by the limiting                    reactant. The amount of product generated by a chemical reaction is its actual                    yield. This yield is often less than the amount of product predicted by the                    stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation representing the reaction (its                    theoretical yield). The extent to which a reaction generates the theoretical                    amount of product is expressed as its percent yield.
The stoichiometry of chemical reactions may serve as the basis for quantitative                    chemical analysis methods. Titrations involve measuring the volume of a titrant                    solution required to completely react with a sample solution. This volume is                    then used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the sample using the                    stoichiometry of the titration reaction.

24,95,100,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Calorimetry: Physical Processes,"One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical            process is known as calorimetryprocess of measuring the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat            transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat is exchanged with a calibrated            object (calorimeterdevice used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released in a chemical or physical process). The change in temperature of the measuring part of the calorimeter            is converted into the amount of heat (since the previous calibration was used to            establish the calorimeters heat capacity). The measurement of heat transfer using this approach            requires the definition of a systemportion of matter undergoing a chemical or physical change being studied (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical            or physical change) and its surroundingsall matter other than the system being studied (the other components of the measurement            apparatus that serve to either provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the            system). Knowledge of the heat capacity of the surroundings, and careful measurements of            the masses of the system and surroundings and their temperatures before and after the            process allows one to calculate the heat transferred as described in this section.

all matter other than the system being studied
A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or            physical process. For example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a            calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the solution, which            increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is            absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature. The            temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be            used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.
Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat            between the calorimeter and its environment. This enables the accurate determination of            the heat involved in chemical processes, the energy content of foods, and so on. General            chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from polystyrene cups.            These easy-to-use ccoffee cupd calorimeters allow more heat exchange with their            surroundings, and therefore produce less accurate energy values, but for the purposes of            a general chemistry student are accurate enough.
Before we practice calorimetry problems involving chemical reactions, consider a simpler            example that illustrates the core idea behind calorimetry.
Click through the slide show below that describes the general concepts of calorimetry.
If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all of this heat transfer occurs between the two            substances (in this example the water and the metal), with no heat gained or lost by            either the calorimeter or the calorimeters surroundings. Under these ideal            circumstances, the net heat change is zero:
This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by the metal is equal to            the heat lost the water:
The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the            negative sign merely shows that qmetal and qwater are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain            or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic sign of either q            value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per            definition). In the specific situation described, qmetal is a negative value and qwater is positive, since heat is transferred from the metal to the            water.
A 248 g piece of copper is dropped into 392 mL of water at 22.6 C in a coffee cup                calorimeter. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 C. Calculate                the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs                between the copper and the water. The specific heat of copper is 0.385 J/g C.
The temperature of the water increases from 22.6 C to 39.9 C, so the water absorbs                heat. That heat came from the piece of copper, which initially was at a higher                temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the copper and the water,                with no heat clostd to the surroundings, then heat given off by the copper = heat                taken in by water, or:
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:
Letting f = final and i = initial, in                expanded form, this becomes:
The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 392 mL of water = 392 g. Noting that the final                temperature of both the copper and water is 39.9 C, substituting known values                yields:
Rearranging to solve for Ti,copper:
Solving this gives Ti,copper = 337 C, so the initial temperature of the                copper was 337 C.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of            an unknown metal.
A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly                transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 C in a calorimeter. The final                temperature is 28.5 C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal.                Use this result to identify the metal.
Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = heat taken in by water,                or:
                qmetal = qwater
In expanded form, this is:
Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was            100.0 C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:
Rearranging the equation to solve for cmetal:
Comparing this with values in the table on page ""Heat Capacity and Specific Heat"" , our            experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g C), so we identify the metal as copper.","Click ""NEXT"" to advance the slide show.,Click ""NEXT"" to see the example progress.",what is calorimetry?,1,1,0.0,41.984596252441406
25,11,11,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Nomenclature for Acids,"Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known            as acidssubstances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water. The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail later in this            course, but for now, it will suffice to note that many acids release hydrogen ions,                H+, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a            mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compounds name.
substances that produces H3O+ when dissolved in water
If the compound is a binary acidcompound containing two different elements (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic                    element) use the steps below to name the acid.
compound containing two different elements
For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the                    solution is called hydrochloric acid. Several other examples of this                    nomenclature are shown in table below.
Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or                    coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you                    will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known                    as oxyacidscompound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and one other element, bonded in a way that imparts acidic properties to the compound (ability to release H+ ions when dissolved in water), compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other                    element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the                    compound (you will learn the details of this later in this course). Typical                    oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion.                    To name oxyacids follow the steps below.

For example, consider H2CO3 (which you might be tempted to                    call chydrogen carbonated). To name this correctly, chydrogend is omitted; the                    ate of carbonate is replace with ic; and acid is addedso its name is carbonic                    acid. Other examples are given in Table. There are some exceptions to the                    general naming method (e.g., H2SO4 is called sulfuric                    acid, not sulfic acid, and H2SO3 is sulfurous, not                    sulfous, acid).

27,38,41,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Wave-Particle Duality of Matter,"Bohrs model explained the experimental data for the hydrogen atom and was widelyaccepted, but it also raised many questions. Why did electrons orbit at onlyfixed distances defined by a single quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, butnever in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen andone-electron ions, but could not correctly predict the emission spectrum forhelium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed tocompletely revise the way they thought about matter.
We know how matter behaves in the macroscopic worldobjects that are large enoughto be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiardball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in astraight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or isacted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-definedposition and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, p = mv) at any given moment.In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is thetypical behavior of a classical object.
When waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are notdisplayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example,interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterssimilar to those shown in the image below. This is a case of wave behavior onthe macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are verydifferent phenomena in the macroscopic realm.
As technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic worldin greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very smallpieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for largeobjects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer thecase for the microscopic world.
One of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of themicroscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: Ifelectromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons andother submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoraldissertation, de Broglie extended the waveparticle duality of light thatEinstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles.He predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linearmomentum p) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value\xce\xbb, given by this expression in which h is the familiar Plancks constant:
\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}
This is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of \xce\xbb discussedearlier, the de Broglie wavelength is a characteristic of particles and otherbodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this equation involves velocity[v, m/s], not frequency [\xce\xbd, Hz]). Where Bohr had postulated the electron asbeing a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized orbits, de Broglie arguedthat Bohrs assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron isconsidered not as a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such thatonly an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly within the orbit.
If an electron travels at a velocity of 1.000  107 m/s and has amass of 9.109  10-28 g, what is its wavelength?
We can use de Broglies equation to solve this problem, but we first must doa unit conversion of Plancks constant. You learned earlier that 1 J = 1 kg/s2. Thus, we can write h = 6.626 -34 J s as 6.626  10-34 kg m2/s.
\\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}
\\lambda = \\frac{6.626\imes 10^{-34}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(9.109\imes 10^{-31} \\mathrm{kg})(1.000\imes 10^7 \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}
\\lambda = 7.274 \imes 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m}
This is a small value, but it is significantly larger than the size of anelectron in the classical (particle) view. This size is the same order ofmagnitude as the size of an atom. This means that electron wavelike behavioris going to be noticeable in an atom.
Shortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists atBell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentallythat electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference patternfor electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. Theregularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interferenceexperiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to besimilar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference patternto form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their cslits,dsince the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same asthe de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. In the image below,part a shows an interference pattern. The waveparticle duality of matter can beseen in diagrams below by observing what happens if electron collisions arerecorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons havebeen recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in smalllocalized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrivedand were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelikebehavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localizedparticles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied byclassical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equationthat governs a probability distribution even for a single electrons motion.Thus the waveparticle duality first observed with photons is actually afundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.

28,2,2,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Introduction,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties Introduction,"            The Crab Nebula consists of remnants of a supernova (the explosion of a                star). NASAs Hubble Space Telescope produced this composite image. Measurements                of the emitted light wavelengths enabled astronomers to identify the elements in                the nebula, determining that it contains specific ions including S+ (green                filaments) and O2+ (red filaments).

In 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of a cguest stard in the sky,            visible even during the day, which then disappeared slowly over the next two years. The            sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the            original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the            remaining Crab Nebula continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light            but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The            nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra            (the colored filaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of            electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms.

30,82,86,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Molarity,"Concentrations of solutions may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of            measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. Molarity (M)unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution is a useful            concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number            of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution.
unit of concentration, defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter of solution
A 355mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the                molar concentration of sucrose in the beverage?
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the                molarity can be calculated using the definition of molarity. Per this definition,                the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:
How much sugar (mol) is contained in 10 mL of the soda described in the example                above?
In this case, we can rearrange the definition of molarity to isolate the quantity                sought, moles of sugar. We then substitute the value for molarity that we derived in                the previous example, 0.375 M.
Distilled white vinegar is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H,                in water. A 0.500L vinegar solution contains 25.2 g of acetic acid. What is the                concentration of the acetic acid solution in units of molarity?
To calculate the molarity, you need mol of solute. Convert grams of acetic acid to                mol.
Substitute the values for mol and L into the definition of molarity.
How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30M solution?
The volume and molarity of the solution are specified. We can rearrange the                definition of molarity to isolate mole.
mol solute = M  L solution
Finally, this molar amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:
When performing calculations stepwise, it is important to refrain from rounding any            intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result.            In the previous example, the molar amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol,            would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be reported; however, although the            last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the            intermediate calculation. If we had not retained this guard digit, the final calculation            for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g.
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, we can also avoid            rounding errors by performing computations in a single step. This eliminates            intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.
In many situations you will be concerned with the molarity of a solution as                    described above. However, sometimes it may be useful to consider the                    concentration of individual ions in solution. Remember the equation for                    molarity:
When ionic compounds are dissolved in water they dissociate into their                    constituent ions. When sodium chloride, NaCl, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Na+ and one Cl ion per formula unit dissolved.                    However, when calcium chloride, CaCl2, is dissolved in water it produces one                        Ca2+ and two Cl ions per formula unit                    dissolved. This means that the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of Ca2+ ions when CaCl2 is                    dissolved in water. Likewise the concentration of Cl ions will be                    twice the concentration of the solution.

The solution of CaCl2 in the right animation has twice the                    concentration of Cl to Ca2+.
What is the concentration in molarity of a CaCl2 solution in which 4.85 g                of CaCl2 has been dissolved in water to form 850 mL of solution? What is                the concentration in molarity of the Ca2+ ions in the solution                and the Cl ions in the solution?
Calculating the molarity of the CaCl2 solution is the same process as we                have seen previously.
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
Since there is one Ca2+ ion produced per formula unit of                    CaCl2, the concentration of Ca2+ is also 0.0514                M.
Since there are two Cl ions produced per formula unit of                CaCl2, the concentration of Cl is:
The concentration of the solution is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Ca2+ is 0.0514 M.
The concentration of the Cl is 0.103 M.

31,87,92,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Quantized Energy and the Photoelectric Effect,"One observation that could not be adequately explained by viewing light as waves                    is the light emitted as objects are heated. The wavelengths and intensities of the                     objects energy distribution can be measured by a spectrometer, and each distribution                     depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. As shown in the figure below,                     the maxima in these spectral distribution curves, \xce\xbbmax, shift to shorter wavelengths as                     the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that as a metal is heated it glows                     red, then orange, yellow, and eventually white (as the intensities of all of the visible                     wavelengths become appreciable at very high temperatures). This common observation was                          at the heart of the first paradox showing the fundamental limitations of classical physics                     that we will examine.
Using the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism, which held that electromagnetic waves                     could have any frequency within a continuously varying range, late 19th century scientists derived                     mathematical expressions for these energy distributions. These expressions fit the observed experimental                     blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths but diverged more and more as the wavelength became shorter,                    with the absurd consequence of infinitely large energies as the wavelength approached zero. This became                     known as the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"", since it implied that everyday objects at room temperature should                     be emitting large amounts of UV light and no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment                     that led to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.
Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for this phenomenon that                    fit the experimental observations. Planck treated the vibrating atoms as the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation                    (a premise from previous work), but instead of allowing the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a                    continuous set of energies (as allowed by classical physics, and as previously thought) Planck proposed that the vibrational                     energies were restricted to a discrete set of values for each frequency (i.e. that energy was quantized).
E\\;=\\;nh\u\\;,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;n\\;=\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;...
The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck\'s constant, in his honor.                    Although it appears that energy is emitted and absorbed continuously and not in                    discrete quantities, notice that the value of Planck\'s constant is very small,                    6.626 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy                    quantization is not observed in macroscopic phenomena.
The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the                    photoelectric effect. It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from                    the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than a                    threshold frequency, unique to the type of metal, was shone on it. Since the electrons in the metal had a                    certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed                    to have more energy - and therefore a higher frequency - to free the electrons. This is illustrated in the animation                    below.
According to classical wave theory, a wave\'s energy depends on its intensity                     (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. However, the frequency at which                     electrons start to be emitted from the metal (known as the threshold frequency)                     does not change when the intensity of the light changes. This is illustrated by comparing                     the animation below with the animation above.
Although the threshold frequency doesn\'t change with changes in intensity (brightness) of the light,                     once the threshold is met the number of electrons emitted within a given time period (i.e. the electric                     current) increases with increasing intensity of the light. This is shown in the following two animations.
Along with the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons also does not depend                     on the intensity of the light. However, if the frequency of the light is increased the kinetic energy of                     the electrons increases as well. This is shown in the graph below.
Different metals have different threshold frequencies. As we have seen in the                    previous animations the wavelength of the frequency threshold for sodium is                    approximately 500 nm. As seen in the animation below the wavelength of the                    threshold frequency for calcium is approximately 400 nm.
In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck\'s quantization                     findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work,                     and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).                     Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated could be                    applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the                    metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of                    particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency,                    according to Planck\'s formula, E = h\xce\xbd (or, in terms of wavelength using c = \xce\xbb\xce\xbd,                    E = hc/\xce\xbb).
Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency                    greater than the threshold). Einstein also argued that the light intensity did                    not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to                    the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This                    explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing                    brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the                    likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.
With Einstein\'s findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Some                    phenomena could be explained by viewing light as a wave and other phenomena,                    such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by viewing light as a                    particle. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level still not fully understood, light                    is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality.
When we see light from a neon sign, we are observing radiation from excited neon                atoms. If this radiation has a wavelength of 640 nm, what is the energy of the                photon being emitted?
We use the part of Planck\'s equation that includes the wavelength, h\xce\xbd\xce\xbb, and convert                units of nanometers to meters so that the units of \xce\xbb correspond to the length units of c.

32,13,13,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Module Summary and Quiz,"Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass                    numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the                    number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is                    composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the                    average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the                    atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, or two-letter                     abbreviations for the atoms.
A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact                    numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives                    the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula                    indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick                    and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule.                    Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements                    of atoms.
The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements                    led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged                    in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known                    as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar                    chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and                    nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition                    metals. Groups are numbered 1 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are                    known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals;                    those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are                    the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.
Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of                    electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the                    preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged                    ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and,                    to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed                    to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in                    the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively                    charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions.                    Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic                    (containing more than one atom).
Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally                    form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead                    consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms                    that behave as a single unit), are called covalent or molecular compounds. Covalent compounds                    usually form from two nonmetals.
Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular                    compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds                    typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written                    first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to ide. For                    example, K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions                    with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the                    metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and                        FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic                    ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular                    compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so                    prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule                    of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and                        N2O4, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important                    class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.                    Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the ide suffix to ic,                    and adding cacid;d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the                    ending of the anion to ic, and adding cacid;d H2CO3 is                    carbonic acid.

33,16,16,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Attractive Forces,"As was the case for gaseous substances , the kinetic molecular            theory may be used to explain the behavior of solids and liquids. In the following            description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion.
Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and            gaseous matter:
From everyday experience we know that substances exist in different states of matter            under various conditions. For example, water is a liquid at room temperature, a solid at            tempertures below 0 oC and a gas at temperatures above 100 oC.            Table salt (NaCl) is a solid a room temperature with a very high melting point and            boiling point of 800 oC and 1413 oC, respectively. While nitrogen                (N2), which is the main component in the air all around us, is a gas at            room temperature with a melting point of -210 oC and a boiling point of -196                oC.
The difference in the conditions at which a substace is a solid, liquid, or gas reflect            the strengths of the attractive forces between the atoms, molecules, or ions that make            up the substance. These attractive forces are either ionic bonds, in the case of ionic            compounds, or intermolecular forces (IMFs), in the case of molecular compounds. IMFs are            the various forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a            molecular substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as will be detailed in this module.            The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative extents of its attractive            forces and the kinetic energies (KE) of its particles. The attractive forces serve to            hold particles close together, whereas the particles KE provides the energy required to            overcome these forces and thus increase the distance between particles.
Consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is cooled sufficiently, the kinetic energy            of its molecules decreases and the attractions between the molecules will be capable of            holding them together when they come into contact with each other; the gas condenses,            forming liquid H2O. When the liquid water is cooled even more, the kinetic            energy of its molecules decreases further and the attraction between the molecules will            be capable of holding them together in a rigid structure to form solid H2O or            ice.
Different substances have widely varying strengths of attractive forces between their            particles because of their composition. These attractive forces have a direct impact on            boiling points and melting points. In this module, we will explore these attractive            forces and their effects. Note that throughout this module we will focus primarily on            differences in boiling points, but, by and large, the concepts discussed can also be            applied to melting points.

34,9,9,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Module Summary and Quiz,"Macroscopic objects act as particles. Microscopic objects (such as electrons)                    have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot                    be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the                    three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according                    to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as . Atomic                    wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the                    wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the                    electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe                    the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.
An atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal                    quantum number, n, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of                    energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus                    are related to n. Orbitals having the same value of n are said to be in the same                    shell. The angular momentum quantum number, l, can have any integer value from 0                    to n  1. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital.                    Orbitals with the same principle quantum number and the same l value belong to                    the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml, with 2l + 1 values ranging                    from l to +l, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition,                    each electron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can be equal to . No two                    electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four                    quantum numbers.
The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals                    are filled (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, and so on). Electron configurations                    and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle                    (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hunds rule                    (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).
Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible                    for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements                    with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same                    group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly                    when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table                    can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last                    electron to be added is placed: main group elements (s and p orbitals),                    transition elements (d orbitals), and inner transition elements (f                    orbitals).

35,106,112,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,Non-Ideal Gas Behavior,"Thus far, the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, has beenapplied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from reaction stoichiometryand empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar massof a gas. As mentioned previously, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal,meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperatureare not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for thesedeviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.
The KMT assumes that the volume of gas particles iszero. This assumption can be made because the volume of the individual gas particles isnegligible compared to the volume of the container that the gas is in. Observe in theanimation below that as the pressure of the gas increases the volume of the gasparticles will take up a larger percentage of the container. Therefore as pressureincreases, gases become less ideal. Gas volumes predicted by the ideal gas equation willbe slightly larger than the actual volume. As pressure increases this difference willbecome greater. The difference becomes very significant at 10 atm.

The graph below shows the measured values of PV/RTfor 1 mole of several different gases at 300 K and varying pressures. Note that thehorizontal line at 1.0 represents the value that would be calculated for PV/RT for eachof the given gases. As the pressure increases, generally speaking, the differencebetween the measured value and the value calculated by the ideal gas law increases.
A graph of the compressibility factor (Z)vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from thebehavior predicted by the ideal gas law.
The KMT also assumes that there are no attractiveforces between particles. Like the assumption about volume, under certain conditionsthis is for practical purposes true. At higher temperatures the attractive forcesbetween the gas particles is negligible and can be ignored. However, when a gas iscooled the particles begin to move more slowly. As the particles are moving more slowly,these attractive forces become more significant. Eventually at some temperature(depending on the gas) the attractive forces will become so significant that the gaswill condense to a liquid.
As temperature decreases the gas particlesmove more slowly. As the particles move more slowly, attractive forces betweenthe particles become more significant. Eventually, if the gas is cooled enoughthe attractive forces will become so significant and cause the gas to condenseinto a liquid.

36,158,171,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Oxidation-Reduction: Oxidation States,"Earths atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O2, a chemically            reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in            many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidationprocess in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons             was originally            used to describe chemical reactions involving O2, but its meaning has evolved            to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox)            reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of            this classification.
process in which an elements oxidation number is increased by loss of electrons
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield            ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium            chloride:
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to            represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a            half-reaction:
These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl2            molecule) gain electrons, the csd subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are            present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the            loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:
In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes reductionprocess in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons        . Viewed from            a more active perspective, sodium functions as a reducing agent(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized (reductant), since it            provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an            oxidizing agent(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes)            sodium.
process in which an elements oxidation number is decreased by gain of electrons
(reductant) substance that brings about the reduction of another substance, and in the process becomes oxidized
(oxidant) substance that brings about the oxidation of another substance, and in the process becomes reduced
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for            example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the            explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the            previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called            oxidation number has been defined. The oxidation numberthe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic (or oxidation statethe charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic) of an            element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic.            The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a            molecule or ion.
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
the charge each atom of an element would have in a compound if the compound were ionic
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals                    the charge on the molecule or ion.
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first,                    followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the                    reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to                    emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.
Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all                the elements in the following species:
a) H2S
b) SO32
c) SO42-
The oxidation number for H is +1.
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the                charge on the molecule or ion.
Since the oxidation state of H is +1 and there are 2 hydrogen atoms in this compound,                in order to obtain an overall charge of zero, we assign  for the oxidation state                of the sulfur.
The oxidation number for each oxygen in this situation, as it is in most, is .

37,135,143,Solutions,Colligative Properties,Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions,"A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that            only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are            capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide            elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove            metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of            how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable            membranes.
Consider the apparatus illustrated in the diagram below, in which samples of pure solvent            and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate.            Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the            concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these            molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a            faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of            solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of            solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.
When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown above, the volume of the            solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the            level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of            the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent            molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a            reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent            ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (\xce) of the solution.
The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T,                    according to the equation
where R is the universal gas constant.
If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in Figure, applying pressure            greater than the osmotic pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes            solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent. This technique of reverse            osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to            produce high-purity tap water for drinking.
What is the osmotic pressure (atm) of a 0.30 M solution of glucose in water that is                used for intravenous infusion at body temperature, 37 C?
We can find the osmotic pressure, \xce, using the formula \xce = MRT, where T is on the                Kelvin scale (310 K) and the value of R is expressed in appropriate units (0.08206 L                atm/mol K).
Examples of osmosis are evident in many biological systems because cells are surrounded            by semipermeable membranes. Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have            lost water can be made crisp again by placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot            or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated salt solution loses            water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect            animal cells. Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are            injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids and blood serum give these solutions            an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body must have            the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood            serum. If a less concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient            quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the diluted serum passes into the blood            cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called            hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the            cells lose water to the more concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a            process called crenation. These effects are illustrated below.

39,168,183,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Dimensional Analysis: Multi-step Conversions,"Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex            problems involving computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the            sameall the factors involved in the calculation must be appropriately oriented to            insure that their labels (units) will appropriately cancel and/or combine to yield the            desired unit in the result. This is why it is referred to as the factor-label method. As            your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this            approach.
Let\'s look at a couple of examples that are a bit more complex
Amanda is 64 inches tall. What is her height in meters?
Notice that on our list of conversion factors there is no direct conversion from                inches to meters. We will take a two-step approach first converting in. to cm and                then cm to m.
One method of using dimensional analysis is to enter the units for the conversion                first and then add in the values. This activity will take you through this                approach.

Convert 22,500 inches to kilometers. Round your final answer to the correct number of significant figures.

Based on these steps, fill in the conversion factors below.
Let\'s say you want to convert from m to ft. You know that 1 m = 3.2808 ft.                    However, this is a unit of length and not a unit of area so we cannot use this                    conversion factor as is.
If we look at the square above that measures 1 meter by 1 meter, to find the area                    we multiply length times width.
Making conversions involving cubed units of volume is similar. Let\'s say you                    want to convert from in3 to cm3. You know that 1 in. = 2.54 cm. However, this is                    a unit of length not volume so this unit cannot be used directly.
If we look at the cube above that measures 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch, to find                    the volume we multiply length times width times height.

For example, if we know the mass and chemical                    composition of a substance, we can determine the number of moles and calculate                    number of atoms or molecules in the sample. Likewise, if we know the number of                    moles of a substance, we can derive the number of atoms or molecules and                    calculate the substances mass.

We can use this relationship between mol of K and g of K as a conversion                        factor and solve using dimensional analysis.
We can see when we set up the dimensional analysis that we will divide by the                        molar mass for the answer.

41,90,95,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Vapor Pressure,"We witness and utilize changes of physical state, or phase transitions, in a great number            of ways. As one example of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation,            freezing, and melting of water. These changes of state are essential aspects of our            earths water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and technological processes            of central importance to our lives.
When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas            phase molecules move randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of            the condensed phase, and in some cases, these collisions will result in the molecules            re-entering the condensed phase. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate            of vaporization, neither the amount of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the            container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in equilibrium with the            liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually            exchanged between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a dynamic            equilibrium, the status of a system in which reciprocal processes (for example,            vaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted by the vapor            in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the            liquids vapor pressure (or equilibrium vapor pressure). We can measure the vapor            pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated            below, and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the            vapor in equilibrium with the condensed phase.
The chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths)            of intermolecular attractions possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit            different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong intermolecular attractive            forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring crecaptured of gas-phase            molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor            pressure. Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and            a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The            following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular            attractive forces.
Given the shown structural formulas for these four compounds, explain their relative                vapor pressures in terms of types and extents of IMFs:
As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to                    the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature,                    the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic energies, with a                    certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and                    escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of                    molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid. The escape of more                    molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that                    escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.
When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric                    pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid is                    the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure                    exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open                    containers, this pressure is that due to the earths atmosphere. The normal                    boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding                    pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). Figure shows the variation in vapor                    pressure with temperature for several different substances. Considering the                    definition of boiling point, these curves may be seen as depicting the                    dependence of a liquids boiling point on surrounding pressure.

42,111,117,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Pressure-Volume Work,"A type of work called pressure-volume work occurs when a system pushes back the            surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the            system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine.            The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as            heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder.
The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of            the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing            work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases.

The work done on the surroundings by the system or on the system by the surroundings can            be calculated with the following equation:
Where                                     Δ                    V                                         =                                                                 V                        final                                                             −                                                                 V                        initial                                                
The negative sign in the above equation is present because when the gas expands (when                    \xceV                is positive), the system does work on the surroundings (w                is negative).

43,192,207,Gases,Gas Laws,Module Summary and Quiz,"The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations            of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to            its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Gay-Lussac\'s law).            The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at            constant pressure (Charless law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely            proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyles law). Under the            same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same            number of molecules (Avogadros law).
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the            gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

44,40,43,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Balancing Chemical Equations,"The chemical equation on the previous page is a balanced equation, meaning that equal            numbers of atoms for each element involved in the reaction are represented on the            reactant and product sides.
This is a requirement the equation must satisfy to be consistent with the law of            conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers of atoms on            either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that            the number of atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of            any formula containing that element by the elements subscript in the formula. If an            element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the number of            atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both            product species in the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the            element oxygen. To determine the total number of oxygen atoms on the product side we add            the 2 atoms of oxygen in the CO2 molecule to the 2 atoms of oxygen in the 2                H2O moleucles for a total of 4 oxygen atoms.
The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and            water is confirmed to be balanced per this approach, as shown here:
Indicate whether the following equations are balanced or unbalanced.
Write a balanced equation for the reaction of molecular nitrogen (N2) and                oxygen (O2) to form dinitrogen pentoxide.
First, write the unbalanced equation.
Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.
Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number                of oxygen atoms. To balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt                would be to change the coefficients for the O2 and                    N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least                common multiple for the O atom subscripts in these two formulas).
The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the                coefficient for the reactant N2 to 2.
The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the                equation is balanced.

It is sometimes convenient to use fractions instead of integers as intermediate            coefficients in the process of balancing a chemical equation. When balance is achieved,            all the equations coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole number to convert the            fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example,            consider the reaction of ethane (C2H6) with oxygen to yield                H2O and CO2 , represented by the unbalanced equation:
Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by            changing the coefficients for the two product species, as shown:
This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd numberno            integer coefficient can be used with the O2 reactant to yield an odd number,            so a fractional coefficient, 7/2, is used instead to yield a provisional balanced            equation:
A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying            each coefficient by 2:
Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the            smallest whole-number coefficients. Although the equation for the reaction between            molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to produce ammonia is, indeed, balanced,
the coefficients are not the smallest possible integers representing the relative numbers            of reactant and product molecules. Dividing each coefficient by the greatest common            factor, 3, gives the preferred equation:
The physical states of reactants and products in chemical equations very often                    are indicated with a parenthetical abbreviation following the formulas. Common                    abbreviations include s for solids, l for liquids, g for gases, and aq for                    substances dissolved in water (aqueous solutions, as introduced in the preceding                    chapter). These notations are illustrated in the example equation here:
This equation represents the reaction that takes place when sodium metal is                    placed in water. The solid sodium reacts with liquid water to produce molecular                    hydrogen gas and the ionic compound sodium hydroxide (a solid in pure form, but                    readily dissolved in water).
Special conditions necessary for a reaction are sometimes designated by writing a                    word or symbol above or below the equations arrow. For example, a reaction                    carried out by heating may be indicated by the uppercase Greek letter delta (\xce)                    over the arrow.
Other examples of these special conditions will be encountered in more depth                    later in the course.

45,126,134,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Electron Affinities,"The electron affinity [EA] is the energy change forthe process of adding an electron to a gaseous atom to form an anion (negative ion).
X(g) + e^- \ightarrow X^-(g) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{EA}_1
This process can be either endothermic orexothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is given inperiodic table below. You can see that many of these elements have negative values ofEA, which means that energy is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron.However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom to become negatively chargedand the value of their EA is positive. (It is important to note that the more negative avalue for EA the greater its EA. The values indicate the magnitude of energy change, thesign indicates the direction.) Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA values areassociated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associatedwith adding an electron to an anion to form a  ion, and so on.
As we might predict, it becomes easier to add anelectron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of the atomsincreases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become morenegative. The exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), andgroup 18 (8A) can be understood based on the electronic structure of these groups. Thenoble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the incoming electronmust be added to a higher n level, which is more difficult to do. Group 2 (2A) has afilled ns subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy np, so,again, the observed EA value is not as the trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A)has a half-filled np subshell and the next electron must be paired with an existing npelectron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electronconfiguration disrupts the trend in EA.
We also might expect the atom at the top of eachgroup to have the largest EA; their first ionization potentials suggest that these atomshave the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we seethat the second element in the group most often has the greatest EA. The reduction ofthe EA of the first member can be attributed to the small size of the n = 2 shell andthe resulting large electronelectron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EAvalue of  kJ/mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EAof fluorine is  kJ/mol. When we add an electron to a fluorine atom to form afluoride anion (F  ), we add an electron to the n = 2 shell. The electron isattracted to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the otherelectrons already present in this small valence shell. The chlorine atom has the sameelectron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron is goinginto the n = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and theelectronelectron repulsions are reduced. The entering electron does not experience asmuch repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional electron more readily.
The properties discussed in this module (size ofatoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and electron affinities)are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has anenergetically favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is mucheasier to form fluorine anions than cations. Metallic properties including conductivityand malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having electrons thatcan be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group anddecreases across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it iseasier to remove an electron that is farther away from the nucleus.

46,138,147,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Resonance,"Some molecules can have two possible structures with the atoms in the same positions and            have identical formal charges such as the nitrite ion seen below. The electrons involved            in the NO double bond, however, are in different positions:
If nitrite ions do indeed contain a single and a double bond, we would expect for the two            bond lengths to be different. A double bond between two atoms is shorter (and stronger)            than a single bond between the same two atoms. Experiments show, however, that both NO            bonds in NO2 have the same strength and length, and are identical            in all other properties.
It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for NO2 in            which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are equivalent. Instead, we use the concept            of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement of atoms can be            written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of            that shown by the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each            of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in NO2 is the average of a double            bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance formstwo or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons. The            actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is            called a resonance hybridaverage of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures of the individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow            between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms. Thus, the electronic            structure of the NO2 ion is shown as:
two or more Lewis structures that have the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons
average of the resonance forms shown by the individual Lewis structures
We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an            electronic structure described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between            resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic structure is always the average of that            shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of resonance theory,            used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and            resonance hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described            it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn because it had many properties in common with            both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn at other times, a            resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros,            it is a real entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some            characteristics in common with its resonance forms, but the resonance forms themselves            are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).
The carbonate anion, CO32, provides a second example of            resonance:
One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central            atom. All oxygen atoms, however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any            one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three resonance forms of the carbonate ion.            Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the actual            arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures.            Again, experiments show that all three CO bonds are exactly the same.

47,69,73,Thermochemistry,Enthalpy,Standard Enthalpy of Formation,"Standard enthalpies of formation provide a convenient means to calculate the enthalpy of            reactions. A standard enthalpy of formation,                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                , of a pure substance is the enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1            mole of that substance is formed from the elements in their most stable states under            standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or            predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to            carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have            values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the            enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hesss            law.
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is .5 kJ/mol. This is the            enthalpy change for the reaction that forms CO2(g) from the elements:
The reactants are the elements in their cstandard statesd, which is the most stable form            of the element at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 C. For the element carbon, the standard            state is graphite, because this is the most stable form of carbon under at 1 atm and 25            C. For oxygen, the standard state is O2(g). The product of the formation            reaction is one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 C. For nitrogen dioxide,                NO2(g),                                     \xce                                            H                        f                        o                                                                     is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
A reaction equation with 1/2 mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is            correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole            of product, NO2(g).
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in            this  Table of Thermodynamic Properties. These values indicate that            formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as  kJ/mol for the formation            of P4O10) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the            formation of acetylene, C2H2). Note that the standard enthalpy of            formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero.
Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic                process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction                in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the                reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation,                                                                \xce                                                    H                            f                            o                                                                                     of ozone from the following information:

48,84,88,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Orbital Quantum Numbers,"The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons inatoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theoryprovides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor tochemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energylevels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in anatom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values andcan jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or staybetween these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n =, 2, 3, . Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greaterfor greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principle quantum numberquantum number specifying the shell an electron occupies in an atom. The principlequantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially thesame concept as the n in the Bohr atom description. Another name for theprincipal quantum number is the shell number. The shellsset of orbitals with the same principal quantum number, n of an atom can bethought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons thatbelong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the correspondingcircular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shellnumber, and so the higher the energy level. The positively charged protons inthe nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attractionbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of theelectrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater theenergy it has.

The principal quantum number, n, is one of three quantumnumbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbitalmathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction), it can be used to find the probability of locating an electron in a specific region around the nucleus, as well as other dynamical variables, which is distinctfrom an orbit, is a general region in an atom within which an electron is mostprobable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability offinding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and isbased on solutions of the Schrdinger equation. In addition, the principlequantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-likeatom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general regionin which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ionsare located. The values for n can be positive wholenumbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4...

Another quantum number is l, the angular momentum quantumquantum number distinguishing the different shapes of orbitals; it is also a measure of the orbital angular momentumnumber. It is an integer that defines the shape of the orbital, and takes on thevalues, l = 0, 1, 2, , n  1.This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only onevalue of l, l = 0, whereas n = 2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. The principal quantum number definesthe general size and energy of the orbital. The l value specifies the shape ofthe orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l form a subshellset of orbitals in an atom with the same values of n and l. In addition, thegreater the angular momentum quantum number, the greater is the angular momentumof an electron at this orbital.

Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitalsspherical region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 0. An electron in this orbital is called an s electron (or the ssubshells). The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitalsdumbbell-shaped region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 1. An electron in this orbital is called a p electron. The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitalsregion of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2. An electron in this orbital is called a d electron, followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitalsmultilobed region of space with high electron density, describes orbitals with l = 3. An electron in this orbital is called an f electron for l =, 4, 5, and there are higher values we will not consider.

The subshell which exist within the shells exhibit different shapes of electron densitya measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function . The value of the Magnetic Quantum Number, ml, indicates the region that an electron occupieswithin a subshell based on the shape of the subshell.
a measure of the probability of locating an electron in a particular region of space, it is equal to the squared absolute value of the wave function 
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical, as seen in the diagrambelow.
For the s subshell there is only one region, the sphere, in which an electroncan reside. Therefore in the s subshell there is only one value for ml, which is designated 0. Each region ofelectron density of a subshell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. Since the ssubshell only has one region of electron density the maximum number of electronsfor any s subshell is 2.
The shape of the p sublevel is more complex than the s sublevel, consisting of 3dumbbell-shaped orbitals originating from a center origin and along the x, y, and z axis as seen in the diagram below.
Within a p subshell electrons may reside in one of the three dumbbell-shapedregions. Therefore, within the p subshell there are three possible values forml, which are -1, 0, 1. Because there are three regions ofelectron density in a p subshell, a maximum of 6 electrons can occupy any psubshell.
The shape of the d subshell is even more complex as seen in the diagram below.Describing the exact shape of the regions of electron density is not importantfor our purposes, but you do need to recognize there are a total of five regionsof electron density within this subshell. Therefore for the d subshell, thereare five possible values for ml which are designated -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.The five regions of electron density, indicate that any d subshell can hold 10electrons.
As you might expect, the shapes of the regions of electron density are even morecomplex within the f subshell. Again, knowing the specific of the shapes is notimportant for our purposes, however you should recognize that there are sevenregions of electron density. Therefore there are seven possible values forml within the f subshell, which are designated -3, -2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3. A maximum of 14 electrons can occupy the seven regions ofelectron density in a f subshell.

49,117,125,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Gravimetric Analysis,"A gravimetric analysis is a process in which a sample is subjected to some treatment that            causes a change in the physical state of the analyte that permits its separation from            the other components of the sample. Mass measurements of the sample, the isolated            analyte, or some other component of the analysis system, used along with the known            stoichiometry of the compounds involved, permit calculation of the analyte            concentration. Gravimetric methods were the first techniques used for quantitative            chemical analysis, and they remain important tools in the modern chemistry            laboratory.
The required change of state in a gravimetric analysis may be achieved by various            physical and chemical processes. A common gravimetric technique is one in which the            analyte is subjected to a precipitation reaction. The precipitate is typically isolated            from the reaction mixture by filtration, carefully dried, and then weighed. The mass of            the precipitate may then be used, along with relevant stoichiometric relationships, to            calculate analyte amount and/or concentration. Watch the video below to see the            gravimetric analysis process involving the precipitation of analyte in detail.

50,143,153,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams,"The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a            molecular orbital diagram, as seen below. For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of            one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each            horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular            orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center.            Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals.            For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular            orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that            combining the six 2p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one  and two )            and three antibonding orbitals (one * and two *).
We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the            orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle.            Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before            pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins            as seen in the diagram below. Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the            molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating            the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular            orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so            parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion            containing seven electrons (such as Be2+) would have the molecular electron            configuration (s)2(s)2(s)2(s)1. It is common to omit the core electrons from            molecular orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence            electrons.
The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both                    bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals. The net contribution of the                    electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the                    bond order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by                    electrons.
When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in                    molecules, we define bond order as the number of bonding pairs of electrons                    between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond has a                    bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order                    differently when we use the molecular orbital description of the distribution of                    electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO technique is                    more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but                    both methods describe the same phenomenon.
In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction                    if it occupies a bonding orbital and it contributes to an antibonding                    interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated                    by subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing                    (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists of two electrons, we divide by two to                    get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:
The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given                    atoms becomes stronger as the bond order increases, as seen in the table below. If the                    distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such                    that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not                    form. We next look at some specific examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.

51,142,152,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Molecular Orbital Theory,"Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the            same way that the distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals.            Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron in a molecule is still described by            a wave function, \xce, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons around            isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized)            energies. The region of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be            found is called a molecular orbital (\xce). Like an atomic orbital, a molecular            orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.
We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms                (H2 or Cl2, for example). Such molecules are called            homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular            orbitals occur.
The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is            called the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the            wavelike properties of an electron. Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic            orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive interference, in which            peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with            troughs, as seen below. In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine            with in-phase waves producing regions with a higher probability of electron density and            out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron density.
There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s            orbitals on adjacent atoms. The two types are illustrated below. The in-phase            combination produces a lower energy s molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s"") in which            most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase addition            (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher            energy s molecular orbital (read as ""sigma-s-star"") molecular orbital in which there            is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the orbital is an antibonding            orbital. Electrons in a s orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are            more stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons            to these orbitals creates a force that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these            orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the s orbitals are located well away from the            region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these            electrons pulls the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding            orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding orbital before the higher-energy            antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill            higher-energy atomic orbitals.
In p orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous            to how a two-dimensional wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate            the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors. When orbital lobes of the same            phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When            regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron            density and creates nodes. When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create  and *            orbitals. If two atoms are located along the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system,            the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form px (bonding) and px (antibonding)            (read as ""sigma-p-x"" and ""sigma-p-x star,"" respectively). Just as with s-orbital            overlap, the asterisk indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a            higher-energy, antibonding orbital.
The side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi () bonding molecular            orbital and a * antibonding molecular orbital, as shown below. In valence bond theory,            we describe  bonds as containing a nodal plane containing the internuclear axis and            perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either side of            the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the  orbital by this same shape, and            a  bond exists when this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact            with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together, making it a bonding orbital. For            the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the            internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.
In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of p            orbitals oriented side by side (py and pz), so these four atomic            orbitals combine pairwise to create two  orbitals and two * orbitals. The py and                py orbitals are oriented at right angles to the pz and pz            orbitals. Except for their orientation, the py and pz orbitals            are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals. The                py and pz antibonding orbitals are also degenerate and            identical except for their orientation. A total of six molecular orbitals results from            the combination of the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms: px and                px, py and py, pz and                pz.
Predict what type (if any) of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave                functions so each pair of orbitals shown overlap. The orbitals are all similar in                energy.
(a) is an in-phase combination, resulting in a p orbital
(b) will not result in a new orbital because the in-phase component (bottom) and                out-of-phase component (top) cancel out. Only orbitals with the correct alignment                can combine.

52,115,122,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Types of Hybridization,"The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a                    central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in a linear arrangement of three                    atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2                    molecule that correspond to the two covalent BeCl bonds. To accommodate these                    two electron domains, two of the Be atoms four valence orbitals will mix to                    yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the                    valence s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp                    hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear geometry. The set of sp orbitals                    appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but there is an important                    difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number                        of hybrid orbitals formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold                    up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point 180 from                    each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now                    distributed to the two sp orbitals, which are half filled. In gaseous                        BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with                    orbitals from the chlorine atoms to form two identical  bonds.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded                    Be atom in the orbital energy-level diagram. These diagrams represent each                    orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each electron by an                    arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow                    to indicate one electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate                    two electrons of opposite spin.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created                    orbitals. The Be atom had two valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets                    one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the unpaired                    electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap                    during the formation of the BeCl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a                    molecule will exhibit sp hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom                    in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in                        Zn(CH3)2, which contains a linear CZnC arrangement,                    and the carbon atom in CO2.
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron                    density consist of a set of three sp2 hybrid orbitals and one                    unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2                    hybridization, the mixing of one s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three                    identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry.
Although quantum mechanics yields the cplumpd orbital lobes as depicted,                    sometimes for clarity these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor                    lobes, to avoid obscuring other features of a given illustration. We will use                    these cthinnerd representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily                    visualize.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests                        sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The molecule is                    trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen                    atoms. We can illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in                    an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in BH3 as shown in the                    orbital energy level diagram. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the                    boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron                    pairs with a hydrogen electron when BH bonds form.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit                        sp2 hybridization. This includes molecules with a lone pair on                    the central atom, such as ClNO, or molecules with two single bonds and a double                    bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O.
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of                    bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of a set of four sp3 hybrid                    orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p                    orbitals that produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals. Each of                    these hybrid orbitals points toward a different corner of a tetrahedron.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by                    four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane                    exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron                    distribution in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in                    CH4. The four valence electrons of the carbon atom are distributed                    equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen                    electron when the CH bonds form.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps                    with one of the four sp3 orbitals of the carbon atom to form a sigma                    () bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent                    bonds between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the                    methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of                    methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms arranged at the                    corners of a tetrahedronthree hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. However, in                    ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an                        sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form a  bond between the                    two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps                    with an s orbital of a hydrogen atom to form carbonhydrogen  bonds. The                    structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane. The orientation                    of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other.                    Experimental evidence shows that rotation around  bonds occurs easily.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For                    example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded by three bonding pairs and a                    lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The                    nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by                    the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of                    two lone pairs and two bonding pairs of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen                    atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by                    lone pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than                    bonding pairs, structures that contain lone pairs have bond angles slightly                    distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5, but the                    observed angles in ammonia (107.3) and water (104.5) are slightly smaller.                    Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,                        PCl3, and NCl3.
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we                    must use five of the valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p                    orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid                    orbitals. With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six                    valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and two of                    the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These hybridizations are only                    possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not                    those in the first or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five PCl                    bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons around the phosphorus atom) directed                    toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p                    orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d                    hybrid orbitals that are involved in the PCl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and                    the chlorine atoms in ClF3 and in ClF4+. (The                    electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2                    hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six bonding pairs of                    electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no                    lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s                    orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals form six equivalent                        sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a                    different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that exhibit                        sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in                        PCl6, the iodine atom in the interhalogens                        IF6+, IF5, ICl4,                        IF4 and the xenon atom in XeF4.
Ammonium sulfate is important as a fertilizer. What is the hybridization of                        the sulfur atom in the sulfate ion, SO42?
The Lewis structure of sulfate shows there are four regions of electron                        density. The hybridization is sp3.

53,159,174,Solids and Liquids,Phase Changes,Module Summary and Quiz,"Phase transitions are processes that convert matter from one physical state into another.            There are six phase transitions between the three phases of matter. Melting,            vaporization, and sublimation are all endothermic processes, requiring an input of heat            to overcome intermolecular attractions. The reciprocal transitions of freezing,            condensation, and deposition are all exothermic processes, involving heat as            intermolecular attractive forces are established or strengthened. The temperatures at            which phase transitions occur are determined by the relative strengths of intermolecular            attractions and are, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of the substance.
The temperature and pressure conditions at which a substance exists in solid, liquid, and            gaseous states are summarized in a phase diagram for that substance. Phase diagrams are            combined plots of three pressure-temperature equilibrium curves: solid-liquid,            liquid-gas, and solid-gas. These curves represent the relationships between            phase-transition temperatures and pressures. The point of intersection of all three            curves represents the substances triple pointthe temperature and pressure at which all            three phases are in equilibrium. At pressures below the triple point, a substance cannot            exist in the liquid state, regardless of its temperature. The terminus of the liquid-gas            curve represents the substances critical point, the pressure and temperature above            which a liquid phase cannot exist.
Before you take the quiz, please evaluate your understanding of the                    learning objectives for the Phase Changes module and use the                    My Response link below to ask any questions you might have about                    the material that you would like the instructor to address.

54,170,185,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Energy of Covalent Bonds,"Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the            strength of a covalent bond by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy            necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of bonded atoms requires            energy. The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it.
The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is            called the bond energy or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic            molecule, DXY, is defined as the standard enthalpy change for the            endothermic reaction:
For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent HH bond, DHH, is 436 kJ            per mole of HH bonds broken:
Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies            in such a molecule is equal to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction            that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example, the sum of the four CH bond            energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the            reaction:
The average CH bond energy, DCH, is             \\frac{1660\\;\\mathrm{kJ}}{4\\;\\mathrm{mols}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{bonds}}\\;=\\;415\\;{\extstyle\\frac{\\mathrm{kJ}}{\\mathrm{mol}}}            because there are            four moles of CH bonds broken per mole of the reaction. Although the four CH bonds are            equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break;            once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining bonds are            easier to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to            break any one bond.
The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the            bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases.            Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the            same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds            between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in the            table below, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds            appears in the table that follows. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the            bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, CF is 439            kJ/mol, CCl is 330 kJ/mol, and CBr is 275 kJ/mol.
We can use bond energies to calculate approximate enthalpy changes for reactions                    where enthalpies of formation are not available. Calculations of this type will                    also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An exothermic                    reaction (\xceH negative, heat produced) results when the                    bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants. An                    endothermic reaction (\xceH positive, heat absorbed)                    results when the bonds in the products are weaker than those in the                    reactants.
The enthalpy change, \xceH, for a chemical reaction is                    approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all bonds in the                    reactants (energy cind, positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds                    are formed in the products (energy cout,d negative sign). This can be expressed                    mathematically in the following way:
In this expression, the symbol  means cthe sum ofd and D represents the bond                    energy in kilojoules per mole, which is always a positive number. The bond                    energy is obtained from a table, like the Bond Energies table above, and will depend on whether the                    particular bond is a single, double, or triple bond. Thus, in calculating                    enthalpies in this manner, it is important that we consider the bonding in all                    reactants and products. Because D values are typically averages for one type of                    bond in many different molecules, this calculation provides a rough estimate,                    not an exact value, for the enthalpy of reaction.
Using bond energies from the table above, calculate the enthalpy change of                        the following reaction:
or
To form two moles of HCl, one mole of HH bonds and one mole of ClCl bonds                        must be broken. The energy required to break these bonds is the sum of the                        bond energy of the HH bond (436 kJ/mol) and the ClCl bond (243 kJ/mol).                        During the reaction, two moles of HCl bonds are formed (bond energy = 432                        kJ/mol), releasing 2  432 kJ; or 864 kJ. Because the bonds in the products                        are stronger than those in the reactants, the reaction releases more energy                        than it consumes:
Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The                        high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon produces a mixture of the                        gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol                        can be produced. Using the bond energies in Table, calculate the approximate                        enthalpy change, \xceH, for the reaction here:
First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the                        products:
From this, we see that \xceH for this reaction involves                        the energy required to break a CO triple bond and two HH single bonds, as                        well as the energy produced by the formation of three CH single bonds, a                        CO single bond, and an OH single bond. We can express this as follows:
Using the bond energy values in the table above, we obtain:
In the following series of activities, we will calculate the change in                        enthalpy for the reaction below using bond energies.

55,133,141,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Multiple Bonds,"The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving            single covalent bonds. Is it also capable of describing molecules containing double and            triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple bonds consist of  and  bonds.            Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to hybrid            orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C2H4, shows us that each            carbon atom is surrounded by one other carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.
The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect            the  bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of sp2 hybrid            orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p orbitals and the 2s orbital.            These orbitals form the CH single bonds and the  bond in the C=C double bond. The             bond in the C=C double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2p orbital            on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital            (lobes shown in red and blue in diagrams below) is perpendicular to the plane of the                sp2 hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a            side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis and form a  bond.
In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the            same plane. If the two planes of sp2 hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each            other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the  bond.            The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable            bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between  and  bonds; rotation            around single () bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not            depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other            words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the             bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the            axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds;            however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the  bonding orbitals,            essentially breaking the  bond.
In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom. We            find this situation in acetylene, HCCH, which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid            orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a  bond between the carbon            atoms. The remaining sp orbitals form  bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized            p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence,            form two  bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one             bond and two  bonds, giving a triple bond.

57,127,135,Thermochemistry,Introduction to Energy,Module Summary and Quiz,"Energy is the capacity to do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE)        is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position,        composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy        is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of        thermodynamics).
The total of all energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (E). As a            system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred            from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. The change            in internal energy of a system can be determined from the equation \xceE = q + w. When the work done            by or on the system is pressure-volume work, the change in internal energy is calculated            using the equation: \xceE = q  P\xceV.

58,98,103,Composition of Substances and Solutions,Aqueous Solutions,Dilution of Solution,"Dilutionprocess of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes is the process whereby the concentration of a solution is lessened by the            addition of solvent. For example, we might say that a glass of iced tea becomes            increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the            volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby            reducing the relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its            taste.
process of adding solvent to a solution in order to lower the concentration of solutes
Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By            adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated stock solution, we can            achieve a particular concentration. For example, commercial pesticides are typically            sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is            appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must            be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of            common laboratory reagents.
A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations            of a solution before and after the dilution process. According to the definition of            molarity, the molar amount of solute in a solution is equal to the product of the            solutions molarity and its volume in liters:
Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:
where the subscripts d and d refer to the solution before and after the dilution,            respectively. Since the dilution process does not change the amount of solute in the            solution, n1 = n2. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to            one another.
Although we derived this equation using molarity as the unit of concentration and                    liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be                    used, so long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method.                    Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more                    general form:
where C and V are concentration                    and volume, respectively.
If 0.850 L of a 5.00M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is                diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the                diluted solution?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and                    C1, and the volume of the resultant diluted solution, V2.                We need to find the concentration of the diluted solution, C2. We thus                rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate C2:
Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased                from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), we would expect the diluted solutions concentration to be                less than one-half 5 M. We will compare this ballpark estimate to the calculated                result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, an improper                substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms                on the right side of this equation yields:
This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (its a bit less than one-half the                stock concentration, 5 M).
What volume of 0.12 M HBr can be prepared from 11 mL (0.011 L) of 0.45 M HBr?
We are given the volume and concentration of a stock solution, V1 and                    C1, and the concentration of the resultant diluted solution,                    C2. We need to find the volume of the diluted solution,                V2. We thus rearrange the dilution equation in order to isolate                    V2:
Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the                original concentration (0.45 M), we would expect the volume of the diluted solution                to be roughly four times the original volume, or around 44 mL. Substituting the                given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
The volume of the 0.12 M solution is 0.041 L (41 mL). The result is reasonable and                compares well with our rough estimate.
What volume of 1.59 M KOH is required to prepare 5.00 L of 0.100 M KOH?
We are given the concentration of a stock solution, C1, and the volume and                concentration of the resultant diluted solution, V2 and C2. We                need to find the volume of the stock solution, V1. We thus rearrange the                dilution equation in order to isolate V1:
Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that                of the stock solution (1.59 M), we would expect the volume of the stock solution to                be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters.                Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
Thus, we would need 0.314 L of the 1.59 M solution to prepare the desired solution.                This result is consistent with our rough estimate.

60,113,120,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,The Spin Quantum Number,"The other three quantum numbers, n, l,            and ml, are properties of specific atomic orbitals            that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located.            Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrdinger equation for electrons in atoms. The            electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon            with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving            the Schrdinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as            the Cartesian x, y, and z). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron crotationd or            cspinning.d Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an            angular momentum, even though this rotation cannot be observed in terms of the spatial            coordinates.
The magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can            only cspind in one of two quantized states. One is termed the \xce state, with the z            component of the spin being in the positive direction of the z axis. This corresponds to            the spin quantum number ms = \\(\\\). The other is called            the \xce state, with the z component of the spin being negative and ms = \\(\\\). Any electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is            located in, can only have one of those two values of the spin quantum number. The            energies of electrons having ms = \\(\\\) and ms = \\(\\\) are different if an external magnetic field            is applied.
The image below illustrates this phenomenon. An electron acts like a tiny magnet. Its            moment is directed up (in the positive direction of the z axis)            for the \\(\\\) spin quantum number and down (in the negative z            direction) for the spin quantum number of \\(\\\). A magnet has a lower energy if its            magnetic moment is aligned with the external magnetic field (the left electron on the            image below) and a higher energy for the magnetic moment being opposite to the applied            field. This is why an electron with ms = \\(\\\) has a            slightly lower energy in an external field in the positive z direction, and an electron            with ms = \\(\\\) has a slightly higher energy in the            same field. This is true even for an electron occupying the same orbital in an atom. A            spectral line corresponding to a transition for electrons from the same orbital but with            z different spin quantum numbers has two possible values of energy; thus, the line in            the spectrum will show a fine structure splitting.
An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l,                        ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the                    orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property                    called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle                    that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general                    behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated                    as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of                    all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the                    same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but                    only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values. Since                    the spin quantum number can only have two values (\\(\\\)), no more than two                    electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the                    same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can                    be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.

The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C            atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule. The lines            represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between            atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss            chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For            now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a            molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with            atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the            atoms.
A representation of a molecule that gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule.
Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules            made up of two or more atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example,            most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are composed of molecules            that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the molecular            formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements            commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine (F2), chlorine                (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most            common form of the element sulfur is composed of molecules that consist of eight atoms            of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a            symbol do not represent the same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent            distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents a            diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are            chemically bonded together. The expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate            hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The expression 2H2 represents            two molecules of diatomic hydrogen.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the            formation of bonds. For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium            and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of            these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present            and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound.            For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white,            blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of TiO2. This identifies            the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide, and            indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the            element titanium.
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which            the subscripts indicate the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the            compound. In many cases, the molecular formula of a substance is derived from            experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the sum            of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be            determined experimentally that benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen            (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one hydrogen atom. Thus, the            empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals            that a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the            molecular formula for benzene is C6H6.
If we know a compounds formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is            somewhat of an academic exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual            practice.) For example, the molecular formula for acetic acid, the component that gives            vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of acetic            acid contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of            atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest,            whole-number ratio of atoms, 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a            molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an empirical formula.

62,194,209,Composition of Substances and Solutions,The Mole,Module Summary and Quiz,"The formula mass of a substance is the sum of the average atomic masses of each                    atom represented in the chemical formula and is expressed in atomic mass units.                    The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular mass. A                    convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules                    is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities                    composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 , a quantity called                    Avogadros number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass.                    Due to the use of the same reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit                    and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) for any substance                    are numerically equivalent (for example, one H2O molecule weighs                    approximately18 amu and 1 mole of H2O molecules weighs approximately                    18 g).
The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers                    of atoms composing its fundamental entities (molecules in the case of covalent                    compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compounds percent                    composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it                    is often experimentally determined and used to derive the compounds empirical                    formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be compared to                    the compounds molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula.

63,97,102,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Covalent Bond Formation,"In ionic compounds, electrons are transferred between atoms of different elements to form            ions. But this is not the only way that compounds can be formed. Atoms can also make            chemical bonds by sharing electrons  between each other. Such bonds are called            covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar            tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or            fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen            atoms bond covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the            H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same            number of valence electrons as the noble gas He
Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic            compounds. Because the attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is            weaker than that between electrically charged ions, covalent compounds generally have            much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many covalent            compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are            typically much softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good            conductors of electricity when dissolved in water, most covalent compounds are insoluble            in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors of electricity            in any state.
Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the            hydrogen molecule, H2, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen            atoms. The diagram illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we            have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the            red line. Along the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms            approach each other (moving left along the x-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to            overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic            nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared            electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the            bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive            charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases.            The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is            achieved.
Similar to hydrogen, an oxygen atom will form a covalent bond with another oxygen                atom to form and oxygen molecule, O2. In this interactive you will                explore the energy associated with the formation of this bond.

1. Click on the radio button for two oxygen atoms.
2. Zoom out on the graph so that the full potential energy graph can be viewed. The                graph should look like the image below.
3. Drag the oxygen atom on the right to the right so that it lines up with the right                side of the graph.
4. When you let go of the oxygen atom you see that it very slowly begins to move                towards the stationary oxygen atom. Continue watching as the two oxygen atoms get                closer together.
5. Now drag the oxygen atom on the right that has formed the covalent bond with the                oxygen atom of the left further to the left. Observe the graph.
It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an            endothermic process), whereas forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic            process). In the case of H2, the covalent bond is very strong; a large amount            of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules            and cause the atoms to separate:
Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2            molecules forms from two moles of H atoms:
Repeat steps 1-4 above. Click on the oxygen atom. Drag the atom on the right to the                right and observe as the two atoms are drawn together to form a covalent bond and an                oxygen molecule.

64,21,22,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Electromagnetic Energy and the Bohr Model of the Atom,Electromagnetic Energy,"Electromagnetic energy is transmitted by waves that have electric and magnetic fields            oscillating perpendicularly from each other and from the direction the wave propagates            or travels, as seen in the animatation below. The electromagnetic spectrum contains waves with a continuous range of            energies, frequencies and wavelengths. There are different classifications for the            electromagnetic waves in the spectrum, many of which you are likely familiar with            including: visible light, cell phone signals, microwaves, X-rays, infrared (IR)            radiation, and gamma rays.
Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic radiation. For example, radio            waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food in your            microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television            screen are forms of electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.
Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in            chemistry, since they can be used to infer the energies of electrons within atoms and            molecules. In this section we will explore the nature of electromagnetic energy, and            in following sections we will see how the theories about electromagnetic energy are used            to help describe the electronic structure of the atom.

65,77,81,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Chemical Reactions and Equations,Equations for Ionic Reactions,"Given the abundance of water on earth, it stands to reason that a great many chemical            reactions take place in aqueous media. When ions are involved in these reactions, the            chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail appropriate to their            intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking            place in an aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and                AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous                Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl:
This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation            because it doesnt explicitly represent the ionic species that are present in solution.            When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate into their constituent ions,            which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a            thorough discussion of this important process is provided later in the course). Ionic            compounds dissolved in water are, therefore, more realistically represented as            dissociated ions, in this case:
Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant            extent, as signified by its physical state notation, s.
Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this            particular case, the formulas for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas            for their dissociated ions:
Examining this equation shows that two chemical species are present in identical form on            both sides of the arrow, Ca2+(aq) and NO3(aq). These                 spectator ions                                                            An ion that remains unchanged from the reactant to the products side of                            an equation.                                                 ions whose presence is required to maintain charge neutralityare neither            chemically nor physically changed by the process, and so they may be eliminated from the            equation to yield a more succinct representation called a                 net ionic equation                                                            A chemical equation written such that all dissociated ions are shown as                            such in the equation.                                                :
An ion that remains unchanged from the reactant to the products side of                            an equation.
A chemical equation written such that all dissociated ions are shown as                            such in the equation.
Following the convention of using the smallest possible integers as coefficients, this            equation is then written:
This net ionic equation indicates that solid silver chloride may be produced from            dissolved chloride and silver(I) ions, regardless of the source of these ions. These            molecular and complete ionic equations provide additional information, namely, the ionic            compounds used as sources of Cl and Ag+.

Begin by identifying formulas for the reactants and products and arranging them                properly in chemical equation form:
Balance is achieved easily in this case by changing the coefficient for NaOH to 2,                resulting in the molecular equation for this reaction:
The two dissolved ionic compounds, NaOH and Na2CO3, can be                represented as dissociated ions to yield the complete ionic equation:
Finally, identify the spectator ion(s), in this case Na+(aq), and remove                it from each side of the equation to generate the net ionic equation:

66,34,35,Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter,Matter,"                        Matter                                                                                    Anything that occupies space and has mass.                                                                         is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass, and it is all                    around us. Solids and liquids are more obviously matter: We can see that they                    take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also                    matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would stay collapsed rather                    than inflate when filled with gas.
Anything that occupies space and has mass.
Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on                    earth. A                         solid                                                                                    State of matter that has a definite shape and definite                                    volume.                                                                         is rigid and possesses a definite shape. A                         liquid                                                                                    State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.                                                                         flows and takes the shape of a container, except that it forms a flat                    or slightly curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity,                    liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and solid samples have volumes                    that are very nearly independent of pressure. A                         gas                                                                                    State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take                                    on the shape and volume of its container.                                                                         takes both the shape and volume of its container.
State of matter that has a definite shape and definite                                    volume.
State of matter that has a definite volume, but and indefinite                                    shape and will take on the shape of its container.
State of matter with an indefinite shape and volume. It will take                                    on the shape and volume of its container.
Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases                    at the same time. This can occur when the sample is composed of many small                    pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is                    composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of                    more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to                    behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny                    particles of water (liquid or solid).
A fourth state of matter, plasma                                                                        A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.                                                            , occurs naturally in the interiors of stars and                    other high temperature situations. Like gases, plasmas are less dense than                    liquids or solids and do not have a fixed shape or volume. But unlike gases,                    plasmas contain significant amounts of electrically charged particles that are                    able to move freely. Due to these mobile charged particles, plasmas are very                    conductive and highly responsive to external electric or magnetic fields. In                    addition to stars, plasmas are found in neon signs, plasma TVs, lightning and                    the plasma torch (shown in the image below being used to cut through metal).
A gaseous state of matter that contains appreciable numbers of                                electrically charged particles.
The                         mass                                                                                    The measure of the amount of matter of an object.                                                                         of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to                    measure an objects mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the                    object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the                    car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is                    to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.
The measure of the amount of matter of an object.
Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing.                         Weight                                                                                    The force that gravity exerts on an object.                                                                         refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is                    directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes                    as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronauts mass does                    not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only                    one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moons gravity is only one-sixth                    that of the earths.
The force that gravity exerts on an object.
The                         law of conservation of matter                                                                                    There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.                                                                         summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that                    there is no change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts                    from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or                    gaseous states (a physical change). This can be seen in a lead-acid car battery:                    The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable                    of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and                    water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of                    matter.
There is no change in the total quantity of matter present when                                    matter is converted from one type to another.
Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter,                    convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled                    conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is                    produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and                    assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But                    because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted                    as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.

67,149,161,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Electronegativity,"Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding            atoms called electronegativitytendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond to itself. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an            atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the            shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an            atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in            a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more            electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the            difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the            larger the partial charges of the atoms.
tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond to itself
The periodic table shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one            of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling. In general,            electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and            decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have            the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all            (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have            the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure            because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a            full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO2 do exist, they can only be            formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model            of electronegativity.)
We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The                    electron affinity of an element is a measurable physical quantity, namely, the                    energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an                    electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes                    how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity                    that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity                    values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of                    bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative scale ranging from 0 to 4.
The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (\xceEN) of two bonded                    atoms provides a rough measure of the polarity to be expected in the bond and,                    thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero, the bond is                    covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic.                    The absolute values of the electronegativity differences between the atoms in                    the bonds HH, HCl, and NaCl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9 (polar covalent), and 2.1                    (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms                    varies from completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic                    bonding). The diagrams below show the relationship between electronegativity                    difference and bond type.
A rough approximation of the electronegativity differences associated with                    covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds is shown in Figure. This table is just                    a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example, the H and F atoms                    in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3                    a difference of 0.9, yet both of these compounds form bonds that are considered                    polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl atoms in NaCl have an electronegativity                    difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI2 have a difference                    of 1.0, yet both of these substances form ionic compounds.
The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the                    types of atoms involved and their relative positions in the periodic table.                    Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and                    a nonmetal is often ionic.
Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds. The atoms in polyatomic                    ions, such as OH, NO3, and                    NH4+, are held together by polar covalent bonds.                    However, these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds by combining with ions of                    opposite charge. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO3, contains the                    K+ cation and the polyatomic NO3 anion.                    Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic                    attraction between the ions K+ and NO3, as                    well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in                    NO3.
Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of                        proteins. Using the electronegativity values in Figure, arrange the                        following covalent bondsall commonly found in amino acidsin order of                        increasing polarity. Then designate the positive and negative atoms using                        the symbols \xce+ and \xce:
The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the                    electronegativity difference increases. The atom with the \xce designation is the                    more electronegative of the two. Table shows these bonds in order of increasing                    polarity.

68,23,24,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Periodic Variations in Element Properties,"The elements in groups (vertical columns) of the periodic table exhibit similar chemical            behavior. This similarity occurs because the members of a group have the same number and            distribution of electrons in their valence shells. However, there are also other            patterns in chemical properties on the periodic table. For example, as we move down a            group, the metallic character of the atoms increases. Oxygen, at the top of group 16            (6A), is a colorless gas; in the middle of the group, selenium is a semiconducting            solid; and, toward the bottom, polonium is a silver-grey solid that conducts            electricity.
As we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an            electron to the valence shell with each successive element. As we go down the elements            in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remains constant, but the            principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of the electronic            structure of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their            chemical behavior. These properties vary periodically as the electronic structure of the            elements changes. The periodic properties we will examine in this module are:
(1) size (radius) of atoms and ions,
(2) ionization energies, and
(3) electron affinities.

69,177,192,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Solids in Liquids,"The dependence of solubility on temperature for a number of solids in water is shown by            the solubility curves in the graph below. Reviewing these data indicate a general trend            of increasing solubility with temperature, although there are exceptions, as illustrated            by the ionic compound cerium sulfate.
The temperature dependence of solubility can be exploited to prepare supersaturated            solutions of certain compounds. A solution may be saturated with the compound at an            elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and subsequently cooled to a            lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains            solute at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower            temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is relatively stable. Precipitation of the            excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal or by mechanically agitating the            solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one pictured in Figure, take advantage of this            behavior.

70,1,1,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Introduction,Introduction to Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,"It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including            graphite and diamonds. But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was            recognized: buckminsterfullerene, commonly known as a cbuckyball.d This molecule was            named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895), whose            signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell            structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, C            60 , and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable            molecule.

71,132,140,Foundations of Chemistry,Atomic Theory,Modern Atomic Theory,"The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms.            It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleusmassive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons composed of positively charged            protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing            negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atoms mass            because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy            almost all of an atoms volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of                10 m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10-15            mabout 100,000 times smaller.
massive, positively charged center of an atom made up of protons and neutrons
For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size            of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium.
Atomsand the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose themare extremely small. For            example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2  10 g. When describing the            properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure.            The atomic mass unit (amu) is the unit of mass that is used for masses of atoms,            molecules, and subatomic particles. The amu is defined with regard to the most abundant            isotope of carbon, carbon. An atom of carbon contains 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6            electrons. (Isotopes will be discussed in more detail in the next module). The mass of a            carbon atom is assigned a mass of exactly 12 amu. Thus, one amu is exactly 1/12 of the            mass of one carbon atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 x 10 g.
The charge of subatomic particles is also extremely small. Like the amu, an appropriately            small unit of charge has been developed to describe the charge of subatomic particles.            An electron has a charge of less than 2  C (coulomb). The fundamental            unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of            an electron (e) with e = 1.602 x 10 C.
A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier            particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is            neutral. The electron has a charge of 1 and is a much lighter particle with a mass of            about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton).            The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in table below.
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number (Z). This is the            defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For            example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic            number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must            contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons            equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number            of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called            its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass            number and the atomic number: A  Z = number of neutrons.

72,7,7,Thermochemistry,Introduction,Introduction to Thermochemistry,"Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in            energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function            without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about 85% of US energy            consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We            use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw materials,            manufactured goods, and people (27%); for industrial production (21%); and to heat and            power our homes and businesses (10%). While these combustion reactions help us meet our            essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific            community as a major contributor to global climate change.
Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than            combustion. For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or            flashlight results from chemical reactions.

73,102,107,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Formal Charge and Molecular Structure,"On the previous page, we looked at three different ways to write the Lewis structure for            the thiocyanate ion (SCN-).
All three structures follow the general rules that we discussed previously. So which            structure is correct? Here we will look at how to use the formal charges that we            calculated for each structure to decide which structure is most correct.
The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many            cases, following the steps for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one            possible molecular structuredifferent multiple bond and lone-pair electron placements            or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal            charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a            particular molecule or ion:
Let\'s apply these guidelines to our three structures for thiocyanate.
Note that the sum of the formal charges in each case is equal to the charge of the ion            (). However, the first arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest            number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline 2). Also, it places the least            electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative            element (Guideline 3).
Let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know from our            previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central            position, but formal charges allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three            possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and double bonds, carbon in the            center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:
Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the            left as preferable because it has only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).
Nitrous oxide, N2O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor                surgeries, such as the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely                structure for nitrous oxide?
Determining formal charge yields the following:
The structure with a terminal oxygen atom best satisfies the criteria for the most                stable distribution of formal charge:
The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no                formal charge larger than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the                preference for having the less electronegative atom in the central position.

Measurements are said to be precise if they yield verysimilar results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurateif it yields a result that is very close to the true or accepted value. Precise valuesagree with each other; accurate values agree with a true value. These characterizationscan be extended to other contexts, such as the results of an archery competition.

Suppose a quality control chemist at apharmaceutical company is tasked with checking the accuracy and precision of threedifferent machines that are meant to dispense 10 ounces (296 mL) of cough syrup intostorage bottles.

Considering these results, she will report thatdispenser #1 is precise (values all close to one another, within a few tenths of amilliliter) but not accurate (none of the values are close to the target value of 296mL, each being more than 10 mL too low). Results for dispenser #2 represent improvedaccuracy (each volume is less than 3 mL away from 296 mL) but worse precision (volumesvary by more than 4 mL). Finally, she can report that dispenser #3 is working well,dispensing cough syrup both accurately (all volumes within 0.1 mL of the target volume)and precisely (volumes differing from each other by no more than 0.2 mL).
Let's take another look at the table in theexercise above. The results of Anita's measurements, which are neither accurate norprecise, represent random error. Random errorError produced from a series of measurement where there is no observablepattern in the results. occurs when the results of a series of measurements produce no observablepattern. Notice that in Anita's measurements some of the values are below theaccepted value and some are above.

Systematic errorError in a series of data in which there is an observable pattern. occurs when the results of a series of measurements produces an observablepattern. Each of Lynette's measurements is less than the accepted value byapproximately the same amount.
Error in a series of data in which there is an observable pattern.
When systematic error is present, it is oftenpossible to pinpoint the source of the error. In Lynette's measurements, it may bepossible that the balance she used to measure the mass of the copper is off byapproximately 1.7 g. This would be something that would be prudent for Lynette to checkto see if she could determine the source of her error. With random error on the otherhand, it is difficult if not impossible to determine the source of the error. Whileideally data that is collected in an investigation is both accurate and precise, datawhich shows systematic error is preferable to that which shows random error.

75,46,49,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Electronic Structure of Ions,"When forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its                    valence electrons, thus assuming the electronic structure of the noble gas that                    precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2 (the                    alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence                    shell electrons and, consequently, to the charges of the cations formed from                    atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed. For                    example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and                    a ground state electron configuration of                    1s22s22p63s23p64s2.

For metals in groups 12, the group numbers exceed the number of valence                    electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility of full d subshells in atoms of                    elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed                    by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10. For                    example, aluminum (in group 13) forms 3+ ions (Al3+).
Exceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the                    groups. In addition to the expected ions Tl3+, Sn4+,                    Pb4+, and Bi5+, a partial loss of these atoms valence                    shell electrons can also lead to the formation of Tl+,                    Sn2+, Pb2+, and Bi3+ ions. The formation of                    these 1+, 2+, and 3+ cations is ascribed to the inert pair effect, which                    reflects the relatively low energy of the valence s-electron pair for atoms of                    the heavy elements of groups 13, 14, and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an                    unexpected behavior: it forms a diatomic ion, Hg22+ (an                    ion formed from two mercury atoms, with an Hg-Hg bond), in addition to the                    expected monatomic ion Hg2+ (formed from only one mercury atom).
Transition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main                    group elements. Most transition metal cations have 2+ or 3+ charges that result                    from the loss of their outermost s electron(s) first, sometimes followed by the                    loss of one or two d electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example,                    iron                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2)                    forms the ion Fe2+                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d6)                    by the loss of the 4s electron and the ion Fe3+                    (1s22s22p63s23p63d5)                    by the loss of the 4s electron and one of the 3d electrons. Although the d                    orbitals of the transition elements areaccording to the Aufbau principlethe                    last to fill when building up electron configurations, the outermost s electrons                    are the first to be lost when these atoms ionize.
There are at least 14 elements categorized as cessential trace elementsd for                        the human body. They are called cessentiald because they are required for                        healthy bodily functions, ctraced because they are required only in small                        amounts, and celementsd in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two                        of these essential trace elements, chromium and zinc, are required as Cr3+                        and Zn2+. Write the electron configurations of these cations.
First, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms:
Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition                        metals, electrons are removed from the s orbital first and then from the d                        orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from the p orbitals                        and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have                        a charge of 2+, and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital.                        Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s electrons and then                        its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron                        configurations of the ions:
Most monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to                    completely fill its outer s and p orbitals, thereby reaching the electron                    configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to determine the charge                    on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must                    be gained to fill the s and p orbitals of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example,                    has the electron configuration 1s22s22p4,                    whereas the oxygen anion has the electron configuration of the noble gas neon                    (Ne), 1s22s22p6. The two additional electrons                    required to fill the valence orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2                    (O2).
Selenium and iodine are two essential trace elements that form anions. Write                        the electron configurations of the anions.

76,88,93,Foundations of Chemistry,Measurements,Significant Figures,"Counting is a type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number             of objects being counted does not change while the counting process is underway.             The result of such a counting measurement is an example of an exact number. If we             count eggs in a carton, we know exactly how many eggs the carton contains. The             numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12             inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram.             Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain             to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.
The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities,                 are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should                 make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface                 of the liquid.
Refer to the illustration in Figure above. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly                 lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21                 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the                 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquids volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number                 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate                 the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place                 digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit                 to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place,                 given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on                 this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division.                 The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL.
This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you                 place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits                 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71                 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement                 of  0.01 gram. If we weigh the quarter on a more sensitive balance, we may find that its mass is                 6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram.                 Every measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the users ability).                 All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant                     figures(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit or significant digits. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you                 stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows ,d then the 1 (hundreds),                 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.
(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit
All digits that are part of a measurement are significant digits. However, in some measurements                 we must include zeros as place holders, it is these zeros that are not significant digits.                 Let\'s look at an example.
Say that you wanted to record the volume of liquid in the flask pictured above. You can say with                 certainty that the volume is between 200 and 300 ml and you can make an estimate that the volume                 is closer to 200 than to 300. Your estimated digit would be in the tens place. Let\'s say you                 estimate that a 2 should be in the tens place. The 2 in the hundreds place is a certain digit                 and the 2 in the tens place is your estimated digit. However, you cannot record the volume as                 22 ml. You would add a zero in the ones place to show the place values of the twos and record                 the volume as 220 ml. In this example the 0 is not part of the measurement, as it is neither                 a certain nor estimated digit, it is a placeholder and therefore not a significant digit.
Here we will look at some guidelines to follow in determining whether or not digits in a measurement                 are significant. All nonzero digits are always significant. The zeros are a little more complex. We                 will use the terms cleading,d ctrailing,d and ccaptived for the zeros and will consider how to deal                 with them.
Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This                 is the number of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the                 left of where the decimal point would be located.
Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never                 significantthey merely tell us where the decimal point is located.
The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation and express the                 number as 8.32407×10-3; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures,                 and 10-3 locates the decimal point.
The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal                 point location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate                 where the decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation:                 1.3×103 (two significant figures), 1.30×103 (three significant figures, if the                 tens place was measured), or 1.300×103 (four significant figures, if the ones place was                 also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is available, it is prudent to assume                 that all trailing zeros are not significant.

77,166,181,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Module Summary and Quiz,"Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron                    configurations. The charges of cations formed by the representative metals may                    be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures of                    these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron                    shell. The charges of anions formed by the nonmetals may also be readily                    determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough electrons to                    fill their valence shells.
Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by                    the nuclei of both atoms. In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared                    equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one                    atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The                    ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called                    its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms                    determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical                    atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or                    pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is the                    case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.

78,79,83,Foundations of Chemistry,Elements and Compounds,Ions,"Atoms are electrically neutral having the same number of protons and electrons. However,            under certain circumstances atoms can become electrically charged. When an atom becomes            electrically charged it is called an ionAn atom that has gained or lost electrons and therefore is electrically charged.. As will be discussed in more detail later in            this unit, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing            electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and            is called an anionA negatively charged ion.. Positively charged atoms called cationsA positively charged ion. are formed when an atom            loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11            electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11             10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two            electrons it will become an anion with a 2 charge (8  10 = 2).

79,162,177,Solutions,Solubility,Colloids,"As a child, you may have made suspensions such as            mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension of solid pigments in water,            known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of            relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying            glass). They are cloudy, and the suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the            other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no settling occurs and in which            the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different            behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the            molecules or ions are invisible, and they do not settle out on standing. Another class            of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit properties intermediate            between those of suspensions and solutions, as illustrated below. The particles in a            colloid are larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small            enough that they do not settle out upon standing.
(a) A solution is a homogeneous                mixture that appears clear, such as the saltwater in this aquarium. (b) In a                colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do                not settle. (c) A suspension, such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of                suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can settle.                (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo:                modification of work by Melissa Wiese; credit c photo: modification of work by                Peter Burgess)
The particles in a colloid are large enough to            scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make colloidal mixtures            appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in the photo below. Clouds            are colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than            molecules, but that are small enough that they do not settle out.
The paths of searchlight beams are                made visible when light is scattered by colloidal-size particles in the air                (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: cBahmand/Wikimedia Commons)
The term ccolloiddfrom the Greek words kolla,            meaning cglue,d and eidos, meaning clikedwas first used in 1861 by Thomas Graham to            classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are            aggregates of hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and            polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely large molecule. The protein and            synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging from a            few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution            components as csoluted and csolvent,d the components of a colloid are likewise            classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically            present in a relatively minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or            solution throughout which the particulate is dispersed is called the dispersion medium.            Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in liquid, liquid            in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given            in the following table.

Colloids are prepared by producing particles of            colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a dispersion medium.            Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
Dispersion methods: breaking down larger                particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing large                particles by grinding in special mills.
Condensation methods: growth from smaller                units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when water molecules                condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact            with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems. Gelatin, glue, starch,            and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal            size; the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are            produced by dehydrating milk spray. Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a            liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or            blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into droplets of colloidal size,            which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be            difficult to clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an            emulsion. In many emulsions, however, the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large            drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by an emulsifying            agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a            little soap will stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of            butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise            is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by            aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the colloidal size range,            drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water            molecules aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce            to form adequately large water drops of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they            settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation methods involve chemical            reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a            concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of            a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such as formaldehyde,            tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:

Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact            (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-term stability of            many colloids.","Dispersed Phase,Dispersion Medium,Common Examples,Name,Preparation of Colloidal Systems",what's the relationship between a solid substance and a suspended substance?,1,1,9.99999999999998,35.5880126953125

If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions is            essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the            substance is known as a strong electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the            dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is called a weak            electrolyte.
Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the            electrical conductance of an aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct            electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged species. Most familiar is            the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged            entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved            ions, with conductivity increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to            electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment of the relative concentration of            dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or            qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit .
Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions. The electrostatic                    attraction between an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole                    attraction. These attractions play an important role in the dissolution of ionic                    compounds in water.
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and                    disperse uniformly throughout the solution because water molecules surround and                    solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This                    process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most                    conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate nearly completely when dissolved,                    and so they are classified as strong electrolytes.
Let us consider what happens at the microscopic level when we add solid KCl to                    water. Ion-dipole forces attract the positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water                    molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they                    attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water                    molecules penetrate between individual K+ and Cl ions and                    surround them, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together                    and letting them move off into solution as solvated ions, as seen in the                    illustration below. The reduction of the electrostatic attraction permits the                    independent motion of each hydrated ion in a dilute solution, resulting in an                    increase in the disorder of the system as the ions change from their fixed and                    ordered positions in the crystal to mobile and much more disordered states in                    solution. This increased disorder is responsible for the dissolution of many                    ionic compounds, including KCl, which dissolve with absorption of heat.
In other cases, the electrostatic attractions between the ions in a crystal are                    so large, or the ion-dipole attractive forces between the ions and water                    molecules are so weak, that the increase in disorder cannot compensate for the                    energy required to separate the ions, and the crystal is insoluble. Such is the                    case for compounds such as calcium carbonate (limestone), calcium phosphate (the                    inorganic component of bone), and iron oxide (rust).
Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very                    slightly ionizedonly about two out of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25                    C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton (H+                    ion) to another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions.
In some cases, we find that solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct                    electricity because the solute molecules react chemically with the solvent to                    produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of                    covalent HCl molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, when we dissolve                    hydrogen chloride in water, we find that the solution is a very good conductor.                    The water molecules play an essential part in forming ions: Solutions of                    hydrogen chloride in many other solvents, such as benzene, do not conduct                    electricity and do not contain ions.
Hydrogen chloride is an acid, and so its molecules react with water, transferring                    H+ ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) and chloride ions (Cl):
This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a strong acid                    and, consequently, a strong electrolyte). Likewise, weak acids and bases that                    only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when                    dissolved in water and are classified as weak electrolytes.

81,59,63,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Quantum Mechanics,"Werner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure                    properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that                    there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particles                    position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the                    momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at                    that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg                    uncertainty principle.
It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the                    momentum and the position of a particle.
For a particle of mass m moving with velocity vx in the x direction (or equivalently with momentum px), the product of the uncertainty in the                    position, \xcex, and the uncertainty in the momentum, \xcepx, must be                    greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{\\mathitf}{\}\\) (recall that                    \\(\\mathitf=\\;\\frac h{2\\pi}\\), the value of Plancks constant divided by 2).
\\Delta x \imes \\Delta p_x = (\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq                    \\frac{\\hbar}2
This equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both                    the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we                    improve our measurement of an electrons position so that the uncertainty in the                    position (\xcex) has a value of, say, 1 pm                    (10-12 m, about 1% of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our                    determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at                    least
\\left[ \\Delta p = m \\Delta v = \\frac{h}{2 \\Delta x} \ight] =                    \\frac{(1.055 \imes 10^{-34} \\mathrm{kg}\\                    \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s})}{(2\\^{-12}\\mathrm{m})} = 5 \imes                    10^{-23} \\mathrm{kg}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}
The value of h is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a                    macroscopic object like a baseball is too insignificant to observe. However, the                    mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the                    uncertainty can be large and significant.
Heisenbergs principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science.                    The uncertainty principle can be shown to be a consequence of waveparticle                    duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum theory                    from classical mechanics. Recall that the equations of motion obtained from                    classical mechanics are trajectories where, at any given instant in time, both                    the position and the momentum of a particle can be determined exactly.                    Heisenbergs uncertainty principle implies that such a view is untenable in the                    microscopic domain and that there are fundamental limitations governing the                    motion of quantum particles. This does not mean that microscopic particles do                    not move in trajectories, it is just that measurements of trajectories are                    limited in their precision. In the realm of                         quantum mechanics                                                                                    field of study that includes quantization of energy,                                    wave-particle duality, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle                                    to describe matter                                                                        , measurements introduce changes into the system that is being                    observed.

Shortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom                    could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a                    particle moving in quantized circular orbits, as Bohr had argued, Erwin                    Schrdinger extended de Broglies work by incorporating the de Broglie relation                    into a wave equation, deriving what is today known as the Schrdinger equation.                    When Schrdinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to                    reproduce Bohrs expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula                    governing hydrogen spectra, and he did so without having to invoke Bohrs                    assumptions of stationary states and quantized orbits, angular momenta, and                    energies; quantization in Schrdingers theory was a natural consequence of the                    underlying mathematics of the wave equation.
Like de Broglie, Schrdinger initially viewed the electron in hydrogen as being a                    physical wave instead of a particle, but where de Broglie thought of the                    electron in terms of circular stationary waves, Schrdinger properly thought in                    terms of three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by                    the Greek letter psi, . A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation                    of the                         wavefunction                                                                                     mathematical description of an atomic orbital that describes the                                    shape of the orbital; it can be used to calculate the                                    probability of finding the electron at any given location in the                                    orbital, as well as dynamical variables such as the energy and                                    the angular momentum                                                                         that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the                    waves represented by  are not physical waves but, instead, are complex                    probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction                     describes the probability of the quantum particle being                    present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be                    used to determine the distribution of the electrons density with respect to the                    nucleus in an atom. The general form of the Schrdinger equation is seen                    below.

Schrdingers work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists                    following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.

82,42,45,Foundations of Chemistry,Properties of Matter,Classification of Matter,"An atomThe smallest particle of an element that retains the propertiesof that element. is the smallest particle of an element that has the properties of thatelement and can enter into a chemical combination. Consider the element gold,for example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of thehalves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained thatwas so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knifemay be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek atomos,meaning cindivisibled). This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided anyfurther.
The smallest particle of an element that retains the propertiesof that element.
An atom is so small that its size isdifficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eyeis a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of acentimeter (0.0001 cm) in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand isalmost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. Asingle carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter,and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. Toput this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, thecross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which wouldrequire about 150 million carbon atom cdimesd to cover it.
The mass of an atom is also difficult toimagine. A billion lead atoms (1,000,000,000 atoms) weigh about 3  10-13 grams, a mass that is far too light to be weighed on even theworlds most sensitive balances. It would require over 300,000,000,000,000 leadatoms (300 trillion, or 3  10 14 ) to be weighed, and they wouldweigh only 0.0000001 gram.
It is rare to find collections ofindividual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, andargon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independentlyof one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms. One form ofthe element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. Theelement sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composedof eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A moleculeTwo or more atoms joined together by chemical bonds. consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemicalbonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of sodain a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. Amolecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules foundin the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or moredifferent atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is aunit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose moleculeis a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass ofwater were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside itwould be about the size of golf balls.
Two or more atoms joined together by chemical bonds.
We can classify matter into severalcategories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A pure substanceA substance that has a constant composition. has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance haveexactly the same makeup and properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar)consists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4% oxygen by mass. Any sample ofsucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, andsweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated.
A substance that has a constant composition.
We can divide pure substances into twoclasses: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken down intosimpler substances by chemical changes are called elementsPure substances that cannot be broken down into simplersubstances by chemical changes.. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiarexamples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturallyon the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories. Allelements are listed on the Periodic Table of Elements as seen below. It islikely that you are familiar with many of these elements, but not all. We willdiscuss the Periodic Table in much more detail a little later in thiscourse.
Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simplersubstances by chemical changes.
Pure substances that can be broken down bychemical changes are called compoundsPure substances that can be broken down into simpler substancesby chemical changes.. This breakdown may produce either elements or other compounds, orboth. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down byheat into the elements mercury and oxygen as seen below. When heated in theabsence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon andthe compound water.
Pure substances that can be broken down into simpler substancesby chemical changes.
The properties of combined elements aredifferent from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, whitecrystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemicalcombination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of itsuncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorlessgases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallicsolid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to formsodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.
A mixtureSubstance composed of two or more types of matter that can bepresent in varying amounts and can be separated by physicalchanges. is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present invarying amounts and can be separated by physical changes, such as evaporation(you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that variesfrom point to point is called a heterogeneous mixtureA mixture with a composition that varies from point to point andtherefore has visibly different parts.. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture, as seen inthe image on left below. Its composition can vary because we can make it fromvarying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point topoint throughout the mixtureone drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a differentdrop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and theherbs settle to the bottom of the container. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chipcookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) andgranite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).
Substance composed of two or more types of matter that can bepresent in varying amounts and can be separated by physicalchanges.
A mixture with a composition that varies from point to point andtherefore has visibly different parts.
A homogeneous mixtureA mixture that has a uniform composition and appears visually thesame throughout., also called a solution, exhibits a uniform composition and appearsvisually the same throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink,consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes mixed togetheruniformly. Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each dropcontains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that thecomposition of a sports drink can varyit could be made with somewhat more orless sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Otherexamples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and asolution of salt in water.
A mixture that has a uniform composition and appears visually thesame throughout.
Although there are just over 100 elements,tens of millions of chemical compounds result from different combinations ofthese elements. Each compound has a specific composition and possesses definitechemical and physical properties by which we can distinguish it from all othercompounds. And, of course, there are innumerable ways to combine elements andcompounds to form different mixtures.
Drag the terms from the bottom of the activity into their appropriateposition in the flowchart below.
Eleven elements make up about 99% of theearths crust and atmosphere. Oxygen constitutes nearly one-half and siliconabout one-quarter of the total quantity of these elements. A majority ofelements on earth are found in chemical combinations with other elements; aboutone-quarter of the elements are also found in the free state.

83,31,32,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Ionic and Covalent Bonding,Ionic Bond Formation,"Chemical bonding is the force of attraction that holds two or more atoms                    together. Chemical bonding is the result of atoms gaining, losing, or sharing                    valence electrons. Ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound form from the transfer of electrons from one atom                    to another to form positively and negatively charged ions. Covalent bondsbond formed when electrons are shared between atoms form                    when two or more atoms share electrons. But why do atoms have this tendency to                    gain, lose, or share electrons to form compounds? The answer has to do with the                    stability of electron configurations. The most stable arrangement of electrons                    is when the outer shell is full. With the exception of the  first shell which                    is full with two electrons, all of the other shells are full with eight                    electrons. It is important to recognize that when the outer shell is full this                    corresponds to the electron configuration of a noble gas. From this general                    observation comes a very important concept of chemical bonding the Octet Ruleguideline that states main group atoms will form structures in which eight valence electrons interact with each nucleus, counting bonding electrons as interacting with both atoms connected by the bond.                    Main group elements will gain, lose, or share electrons in order to obtain the                    electron configuration of a noble gas.

Previously, we discussed the basic concepts of ionic and covalent bonding. In                    this unit, we will look at chemical bonding in more detail, beginning here with                    ionic bonding.
As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A                    cation (a positive ion) forms when a neutral atom loses one or more electrons                    from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral atom                    gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.
Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their                    constituent ions are held together by ionic bondselectrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions of an ionic compound: electrostatic forces of                    attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of                    ionic compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids                    exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be rigid and brittle; they also tend                    to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are                    very strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same                    reasonthe strength of ionic bonds prevents ions from moving freely in the solid                    state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or                    melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because                    the ions can move about freely.

Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical                    properties. Sodium atoms form sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that                    burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine atoms form                    chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to                    most metals and very poisonous to animals and plants. The vigorous reaction                    between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline compound                    sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride                    anions. The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely                    different from the properties of the elements sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is                    poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react                    vigorously with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.
Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms                    the cations) and a nonmetal (which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a                    binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such compounds in                    terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have                    relatively low ionization energies and lose electrons easily. The lower the IE                    the more easily the atom loses electrons and the more chemically reactive. The                    most chemically reactive metals are in the lower left of the periodic table.                    Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain                    electrons lost by metal atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. The most                    chemically reactive nonmetals are found in the upper-right corner of the                    periodic table not including the noble gases. The noble gases have very high                    ionization energies and very low electron affinities. With only a few                    exceptions, the noble gases do not form chemical bonds and are extremely                    unreactive.
As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive                    charges on the cations of an ionic compound must equal the total number of                    negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound represents the                    simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of                    positive and negative charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide,                        Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound contains two                    aluminum cations, Al3+, for every three oxide anions, O2                    [thus, (2  +3) + (3  ) = 0].
It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not                    represent the physical arrangement of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a                    sodium chloride (NaCl) cmoleculed because there is not a single ionic bond, per                    se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces                    between ions are isotropicthe same in all directionsmeaning that any                    particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite                    charge. This results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound,                    three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for example, consists of a                    regular arrangement of equal numbers of Na+ cations and                        Cl anions.

84,74,78,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding,Hybrid Atomic Orbitals,"Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how            chemical bonds form in diatomic molecules. However, to understand how molecules with            more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example,            let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two            hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration                1s22s22p4, with two unpaired electrons (one in each            of the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two OH bonds form            from the overlap of these two 2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If            this were the case, the bond angle would be 90, as shown below, because p orbitals are            perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is 104.5,            not 90. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world            observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed.
Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O            differ from those predicted by the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with            the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical expression known as the wave            function, , contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of            electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave            functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes.            This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization            and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, LCAO,            (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are            called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital            and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule            differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward            the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals            should result in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5). The observed angle of 104.5 is            experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful            explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate            predictions.
The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:

85,32,33,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,"The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are            empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The            mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases            at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships            that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these            relationships.
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively            explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is            based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term cmoleculed will            be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some            gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)
The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the            behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT,            which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately            represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws            (Boyles, Charless, Gay-Lussac\'s, Avogadros, and Daltons laws) conceptually to see            how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships            between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain            Grahams law.
Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends            directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we            see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas. In the following series of            activities use your knowledge of the gas laws to answer the following questions, thereby            making the connection as to how the KMT explains the observations that result in the gas            laws.

Temperatureintensive property of matter that is a quantitative measure of chotnessd and ccoldnessd is a quantitative measure of chotd or ccold.d When the atoms and            molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average            kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is chot.d When the atoms and molecules            are moving slowly, they have lower KE, and we say that the object is ccoldd.

And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as            condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of            matter will cause its temperature to decrease.

Heattransfer of thermal energy between two bodies (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at            different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases            the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we            initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low            temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a            higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L,            the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The            temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the            temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules.            Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature.

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A            change that releases heat is called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion            reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that releases heatthis            process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torchs flame. A            reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic processchemical reaction or physical change that absorbs heat. A cold pack used to            treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances            in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the            resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

87,25,26,Gases,Gas Laws,Gas Pressure,"The earths atmosphere exerts a pressure, as doesany other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric pressure, we are sensitiveto pressure changesfor example, when your ears cpopd during take-off and landing whileflying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gasmolecules colliding with the surfaces of objects. Although the force of each collisionis very small, any surface of appreciable area experiences a large number of collisionsin a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air pressure isstrong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from insidethe container.
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of thecolumn of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object, such as the tanker car. Atsea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown Africanelephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. Ifyou actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twicethe usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.
In general, pressure is defined as theforce exerted on a given area: P=FA. Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inverselyproportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing theamount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure canbe decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area.
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal(Pa), with 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 , where N is the newton, a unit of forcedefined as 1 kg m/s2. One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases,it is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) or bar (1 bar= 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds offorce on an area of one square inchpounds per square inch (psi)for example, incar tires. Pressure can also be measured using the unit atmosphere (atm), whichoriginally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximatelatitude of Paris (45).
The most commonly used units in this courseare kPa, atm, and mmHg or torr. The unit of mmHg refers to pressure measured ina barometer, which we will discuss shortly. At standard atmospheric pressure or atm the height of a column of mercury in a barometer is 760 mm. A torr is aunit that can be used interchangeably with mmHg, named after EvangelistaTorricelli, inventor of the barometer.
The US Weather Service reports airpressure in inches of mercury. If the pressure is reported on a particularday as 29.5 in. Hg, what is the pressure in units of atm? (1 inch = 2.54cm)
Here we will use a multi-stepdimensional analysis to make the conversion.

88,153,165,Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry,Lewis Structures,Exceptions to the Octet Rule,"While most central atoms of molecules and polyatomic ions have eight electrons, some have            central atoms that do not have an octet of electrons in their Lewis structures. These            molecules fall into three categories:
First we will consider hypervalent molecules. These are the most common of the exceptions            and will be important to understand for our discussion in the next module.
Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n =                    2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell orbitals because                    they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three                        2p orbitals).
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 2nd period, C, N, O, and F do NOT exceed                    an octet.
Elements in the third and higher periods (n  3) have                    their valence electrons in the 3rd period or higher. These shells include a d                    subshell and allow atoms in the 3rd period or higher to accommodate more than an                    octet of electrons.
Elements that form covalent bonds in the 3rd period or higher, while they usually                    form an octet, can exceed an octet of electrons. Molecules formed from these                    elements are called hypervalent molecules. The Lewis structures below show two                    hypervalent molecules, SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, which is used as an                    insulating gas in the electrical industry, but is a potent greenhouse gas.
In some hypervalent molecules, such as XeF4, xenon tetrafluoride which                     was the first binary compound of a noble gas, some of the electrons in                    the outer shell of the central atom are lone pairs:
When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have                    electrons left over after filling the valence shells of the outer atoms with                    eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central                    atom.
Determine the Lewis structure for phosphorus pentachloride,                        PCl5, which is an important chlorinating agent in organic and inorganic synthesis. .
As before, we need to calculate the number of valence electrons that will be                        represented in the Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central P atom to the terminal Cl atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The Lewis structure now shows all 40 valence electrons in the molecule and is                        therefore complete.
Determine the Lewis structure for iodine pentafluoride, IF5, a fluorinating agent.
Calculate the number of valence electrons that will be represented in the                        Lewis structure.
We use single bonds to connect the central I atom to the terminal F atoms to                        develop a skeleton structure.
The skeleton structure shows 10 electrons, which means there are 32 more                        electrons to incorporate into the structure. Add electrons to the terminal                        atoms first.
The structure with the octets of the terminal atoms complete shows 40                        electrons. There are still 2 electrons to incorporate into the structure.                        These additional electrons are added to the central atom.
Now the structure shows all 42 electrons. Note that no additional electrons                        can be added to the F atoms because F is in the 2nd period and cannot exceed                        an octet of electrons.
We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not                    have a filled valence shell. Generally, these are molecules with central atoms                    from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not                    form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium                    dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3, the beryllium                    and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is                    possible to draw a structure with a double bond between a boron atom and a                    fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental                    evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for BF single                    bonds. This suggests the best Lewis structure has three BF single bonds and an                    electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent with                    an electron deficient boron. However, the BF bonds are slightly shorter than                    what is actually expected for BF single bonds, indicating that some double bond                    character is found in the actual molecule.
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight                    electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with a molecule containing an                    atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with                        BF3 because the lone pair on nitrogen can be shared with the                    boron atom:
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals.                            Nitric oxide, NO a biological signaling molecule, is an example of an odd-electron molecule; it is                            produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react                            at high temperatures. Odd electron molecules are very rare and cannot                            achieve full octets of electrons around atoms because of the odd number                            of electrons. The two possible Lewis structures for NO are seen                            below. Based on formal charge, the left structure is more plausible than the right structure.

89,51,54,Thermochemistry,Calorimetry,Heat Capacity and Specific Heat,"Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorieunit of heat or other energy; the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius; 1 cal is defined as 4.184 J is the amount of            energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this            quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water.            The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is            still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used            in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and            energy is the jouleSI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of            1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James            Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is            also called 1 newtonmeter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its            definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.
unit of heat or other energy; the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius; 1 cal is defined as 4.184 J
SI unit of energy; 1 joule is the kinetic energy of an object with a mass of 2 kilograms moving with a velocity of 1 meter per second, 1 J = 1 kg m2/s and 4.184 J = 1 cal
We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change: heat            capacity and specific heat capacity.
The heat capacity (C) of a body of matter is the quantity of                            heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change                            (\xceT) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):
Heat capacityextensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs                    or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive propertyits value is                    proportional to the amount of the substance.
extensive property of a body of matter that represents the quantity of heat required to increase its temperature by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans.
The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small                    pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large                    pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more                    atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of                    those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan                    is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature                    of the pan by 50.0 C:
The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires                    90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 C. The larger pan has a                    (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material                    requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same                    temperature change:
The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its cspecific                            heat,d is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram                            of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):
Specific heat capacityintensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin) depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or                    releasing heat. It is an intensive propertythe type, but not the amount, of the                    substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a                    mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is                    therefore:
intensive property of a substance that represents the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin)
The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can                    also calculate the specific heat of iron:
Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of                    the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the                    material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of                    energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from                    a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity,                    also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular                    substance and has units of J/mol C.",,what is the same as a kilojoule and a newtonmeter?,1,0,5.888888888888883,75.63496398925781
90,128,136,Solutions,Solubility,Solutions of Gases in Liquids,"The chemical structures of the solute and solvent dictate the types of forces possible            and, consequently, are important factors in determining solubility. For example, under            similar conditions, the water solubility of oxygen is approximately three times greater            than that of helium, but 100 times less than the solubility of chloromethane,                CHCl3. Considering the role of the solvents chemical structure, note            that the solubility of oxygen in the liquid hydrocarbon hexane,                C6H14, is approximately 20 times greater than it is in            water.
Other factors also affect the solubility of a given substance in a given solvent.            Temperature is one such factor, with gas solubility typically decreasing as temperature            increases, as seen in the graph below. This is one of the major impacts resulting from            the thermal pollution of natural bodies of water.
When the temperature of a river, lake, or stream is raised abnormally high, usually due            to the discharge of hot water from some industrial process, the solubility of oxygen in            the water is decreased. Decreased levels of dissolved oxygen may have serious            consequences for the health of the waters ecosystems and, in severe cases, can result            in large-scale fish kills.
The solubility of a gaseous solute is also affected by the partial pressure of solute in            the gas to which the solution is exposed. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of            the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration of this            relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively            high pressure of carbon dioxide gas and then sealing the beverage container, thus            saturating the beverage with CO2 at this pressure. When the beverage            container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is            released, and some of the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in            the form of small bubbles. At this point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon            dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration will decrease to its            equilibrium value and the beverage will become cflat.d
For many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility and partial pressure is a            proportional one and can be determined using Henry\'s law.
The quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is                    directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.
where Cg is solubility, Pg is partial pressure, and k                    is a proportionality constant that depends on the identities of the gaseous                    solute and solvent, and on the solution temperature.
At 20 C, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water exposed to gaseous oxygen at                a partial pressure of 101.3 kPa is 1.38  10 mol L. Use                Henrys law to determine the solubility of oxygen when its partial pressure is 20.7                kPa, the approximate pressure of oxygen in earths atmosphere.
According to Henrys law, for an ideal solution the solubility, Cg, of a gas (1.38  10 mol L, in                this case) is directly proportional to the pressure, Pg, of the undissolved gas above the solution (101.3 kPa in                this case). Because we know both Cg and Pg, we can rearrange this expression to solve for                    k.
Now we can use k to find the solubility at the lower pressure.
Notice that as the pressure decreased from 101.3 kPa to 20.7 kPa the concentration also decreased,                 illustrating the direct proportionality of pressure and concentration of a gas in a liquid.

91,19,20,Solutions,Solubility,Properties of Solutions,"An earlier unit introduced solutions, defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more            substances. Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater            concentration, in which case it is called the solvent. The other components of the            solution present in relatively lesser concentrations are called solutes. Sugar is a            covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules,            C12H22O11. When this compound dissolves in water, its            molecules become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water:
The caqd in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are            therefore individually dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent).            Although sucrose molecules are heavier than water molecules, they remain dispersed            throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to csettle outd over time.
Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is an ionic compound            composed of colorless potassium ions, K+, and orange dichromate ions,                Cr2O72. When a small amount of solid potassium            dichromate is added to water, the compound dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium            ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed throughout the mixture (seen below), as            indicated in this equation:
As with the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its            solutes, potassium and dichromate ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent            (water) molecules.
Water is used so often as a solvent that the word solution has come to imply an aqueous            solution to many people. However, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent.            Many alloys are solid solutions of one metal dissolved in another; for example, US            five-cent coins contain nickel dissolved in copper. Air is a gaseous solution, a            homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and several other gases. Oxygen (a gas),            alcohol (a liquid), and sugar (a solid) all dissolve in water (a liquid) to form liquid            solutions. The table below gives examples of several different solutions and the phases            of the solutes and solvents.

92,72,76,Gases,Stoichiometry of Gases,Gas Density and Molar Mass,"One important application of the ideal gas law is to determine its molar mass and thereby            assist in its identification using the measured density of the gas. Review the            interactive below to see the derivation of the formula used to calculate the molar mass            of a gas from its density.
Press ""NEXT"" to advance slide show.
The molar mass of a gas can be determined given its density, temperature, and pressure            with the following equation:
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
Where d = density, R = ideal gas law            constant, T = temperature, and P = pressure.
A gas was found to have a density of 0.0847 g/L at 17.0 C and a pressure of 760                torr. What is its molar mass? What is the gas?
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
As before when using the ideal gas law constant, we need to ensure that the units in                the constant match the units used for the other variables and as before when using                the ideal gas law equation temperature must be in K. First we will convert the                pressure to units of atm. You will recall that 760 torr = 1 atm.
\equire{cancel} \equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{(0.0847                    \\mathrm{g/}\\cancel{\\mathrm{L}})( 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}\\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}\\ \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(290                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})}{1 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}}
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = 2.02 \\mathrm{g/mol}
The gas is hydrogen, H2.
This equation can also be used to determine the density of a known gas at a given            temperature and pressure.
Calculate the density of chlorine gas (Cl2) at 22 oC and 735 torr.
We can use the molar mass of a gas equation,
\equire{mathrsfs} \\mathscr{M} = \\frac{dRT}{P}
rearranging it to solve for density.
\equire{mathrsfs} d = \\frac{\\mathscr{M}P}{RT}
Because we know the identity of the gas, we can easily calculate its molar mass and                substitute it and the other given values (making the necessary conversions) into the                equation.
\equire{cancel} d = \\frac{(70.90 \\mathrm{g/}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}})(0.967 \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}})}{ (0.08206                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{atm}}\\ \\mathrm{L} \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}}\\                    \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}})(295 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}})} = 2.83                    \\mathrm{g/L}

93,78,82,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Ionic Radii,"Ionic radius is the measure used to describe thesize of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the same number of protons asthe parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived, as seen in thefigure below for the aluminum atom and ion. For example, the covalent radius of analuminum atom (1s22s22p63s23p1)is 118 pm, whereas the ionic radius of an Al3+(1s22s22p6) is 68 pm. As electrons are removed fromthe outer valence shell, the remaining core electrons occupying smaller shellsexperience a greater effective nuclear charge Zeff(as discussed previously) and are drawn even closer to the nucleus.
Cations with larger charges are smaller thancations with smaller charges (e.g., V2+ has an ionic radius of 79 pm, whilethat of V3+ is 64 pm). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, wefind that cations of successive elements with the same charge generally have largerradii, corresponding to an increase in the principal quantum number, n.
An anion (negative ion) is formed by the additionof one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This results in a greaterrepulsion among the electrons and a decrease in Zeffper electron. Both effects (the increased number of electrons and the decreased Zeff) cause the radius of an anion to be larger thanthat of the parent atom, as seen in the figure above for the sulfur atom and ion. Forexample, a sulfur atom ([Ne]3s23p4) has a covalent radius of 104pm, whereas the ionic radius of the sulfide anion ([Ne]3s23p6) is pm. For consecutive elements proceeding down any group, anions have larger principalquantum numbers and, thus, larger radii.
Atoms and ions that have the same electronconfiguration are said to be isoelectronic. Examples of isoelectronic species are N, O 2, F , Ne, Na+, Mg2+,and Al3+ (1s22s22p6). Another isoelectronicseries is P3, S2, Cl, Ar, K+,+, and Sc3+ ([Ne]3s23p6). For atomsor ions that are isoelectronic, the number of protons determines the size. The greaterthe nuclear charge, the smaller the radius in a series of isoelectronic ions and atoms

94,185,200,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Quantum Theory,Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table,"As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number            so that elements with the same chemical properties recur periodically. When their            electron configurations are added to the table as in the periodic table below, we also            see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of            these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play            the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest            energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core            electrons. Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties            of the elements.
It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the            chemical behavior of the elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was            available. Now we can understand why the periodic table has the arrangement it hasthe            arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons in the            same group. This arrangement is emphasized in the periodic table below.
Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the            alkali metals lithium and sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth            metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and the halogens fluorine and chlorine            each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among elements            of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is            the loss, gain, or sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.
The periodic table can be divided into three categories of elements classified by the            orbitals being filled: main group, transition elements, and inner transition elements.            These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or            highest energy level orbitals of an atom.
Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the            last electron added enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and            red in periodic table below. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as            well as many metals and the intermediate semimetallic elements. The valence electrons            for main group elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga,            atomic number 31) has the electron configuration                [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence            electrons (underlined). The completely filled d orbitals count as core, not valence,            electrons. Gallium is in group 13 of the periodic table. Just as it has 3 valence            electrons all of the elements in group 13 have 3 valence electrons. The periodic table            below indicates the number of valence electrons for each group of the main group            elements.
Transition elements or transition metals are metallic elements in which the last electron            added enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas            configuration) in these elements include the ns and (n  1) d electrons.
Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies            an f orbital. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n             2)f, the (n  1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:
The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)
The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)
Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series,            are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no            f electrons.
The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron                    configuration of an element. However, we do find exceptions to the order of                    filling of orbitals that are indicated by the aufbau principle we have just                    discussed. For instance, the electron configurations of the transition metals                    chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others,                    are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells                    with very similar energy (such as with 4s and 3d), and small effects can lead to                    changes in the order of filling.
In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled                    subshells apparently represent conditions of preferred stability. This stability                    is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the                    extra stability of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in                    Cu). Other exceptions also occur. There is no simple method to predict the                    exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is                    greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.

95,139,148,Reactions and Stoichiometry,Reaction Stoichiometry,Application of Stoichiometry: Titration,"In the 18th century, the concentration of vinegarsamples was determined by noting the amount of potassium carbonate, K2CO3 , which had to be added, a little at a time, before bubbling ceased.The greater the weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where thebubbling ended, the more concentrated the vinegar.
We now know that the effervescence that occurredduring this process was due to reaction with acetic acid, CH3CO2H, the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste ofvinegar. Acetic acid reacts with potassium carbonate according to the followingequation:
The bubbling was due to the production of CO2 gas.
The test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is onetype of quantitative analysisthe determination of the amount or concentration of asubstance in a sample. In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute(acetic acid) was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solutepresent in a known volume of the solution. In other types of chemical analyses, theamount of a substance present in a sample is determined by measuring the amount ofproduct that results.
The described approach to measuring vinegarstrength was an early version of the analytical technique known as titrationanalysisquantitative chemical analysis method that involves measuring the volume of a reactant solution required to completely react with the analyte in a sample. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buretdevice used for the precise delivery of variable liquid volumes, such as in a titration analysis to makeincremental additions of a solution containing a known concentration of somesubstance (the titrantsolution containing a known concentration of substance that will react with the analyte in a titration analysis) to a sample solution containing the substance whoseconcentration is to be measured (the analytechemical species of interest). The titrant and analyte undergo achemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrantsolution required for complete reaction with the analyte (the equivalence pointvolume of titrant solution required to react completely with the analyte in a titration analysis; provides a stoichiometric amount of titrant for the samples analyte according to the titration reactionof the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration.

The equivalence point of a titration may bedetected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solutionaccompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in theclassic vinegar analysis is one such example, though, more commonly, specialdyes called indicatorssubstances added to the sample in a titration analysis to permit visual detection of the end point are added to the sample solutions to impart a change incolor at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence pointsmay also be detected by measuring some solution property that changes in apredictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approachtaken to detect a titrations equivalence point, the volume of titrant actuallymeasured is called the end point. Properly designed titration methods typicallyensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible.Though any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titrationanalysis, the three described in this unit (precipitation, acid-base, and redox)are most common.

97,104,110,Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties,Periodic Properties,Variation in Ionization Energies,"The amount of energy required to remove the mostloosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state is called its firstionization energy (IE1 ). The first ionization energy for an element, X, isthe energy required to form a cation with +1 charge:
X(g) \ightarrow X^{+} + e^{-} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{IE}_1
The energy required to remove the second mostloosely bound electron is called the second ionization energy (IE 2 ).
X^{+}(g) \ightarrow X^{2+}(g) + e^{-} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{IE}_2
The energy required to remove the third electron isthe third ionization energy, and so on. Energy is always required to remove electronsfrom atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are alwayspositive. For larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from thenucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as size (atomic radius) increases, theionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learnedabout radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and toincrease across a period.
The graph below shows the relationship between thefirst ionization energy and the atomic number of several elements. The values of firstionization energy for the elements are given in periodic table below the graph. Within aperiod, the IE1 generally increases with increasing Z. Down a group, the IE value generally decreases with increasing Z. There are some systematicdeviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomicnumber 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclearcharge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy ofthe subshells increases as oneincreases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussedpreviously). Within any one shell, the s electrons are lower in energy than the pelectrons. This means that an s electron is harder to remove from an atom than a pelectron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium([He]2s2 ) is an s electron, whereas the electron removed during theionization of boron ([He]2s22p 1) is a p electron; this resultsin a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greaterby one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring eachtime a new subshell begins.
Another deviation occurs as orbitals become morethan one-half filled. The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than thatfor nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing IE1 values across a period.Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron willeliminate the electronelectron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the 2porbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable).Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods.
Removing an electron from a cation is moredifficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greaterelectrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from acation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electronfrom an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for oneelement always increase. As seen in Table below, there is a large increase in theionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds toremoval of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valenceelectrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so therapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.

98,125,133,Solids and Liquids,Intermolecular Forces,Dipole-Dipole Attractions,"Recall from the unit on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that polar molecules have            a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of            the moleculea separation of charge called a dipole. Consider a polar molecule such as            hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl atom bears the            partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial            positive charge. An attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction            between the positive end of one HCl molecule and the negative end of another. This            attractive force is called a dipole-dipole attractionthe electrostatic force between            the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of            another, as illustrated below.
The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of            HCl molecules to nonpolar F2 molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of            the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass. At a            temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE.            However, the dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause            them to cstick togetherd to form a liquid, whereas the relatively weaker dispersion            forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are not, and so this substance is            gaseous at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to                F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the greater strength of dipole-dipole            attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar                F2 molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing            points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as indicators of the relative strengths            of IMFs of attraction present within different substances.
Predict which will have the higher boiling point: N2 or CO. Explain your                reasoning.
CO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience                similar London dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences                dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit                dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO molecules are                comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO                is expected to have the higher boiling point.

99,140,149,Gases,The Kinetic-Molecular Theory,The van der Waals Equation,"The ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas            molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable            part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of low pressure            and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and            deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregardedthis is,            however, is not always the case.
In 1879, the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals developed an equation which corrects            for the attraction between gas particles and their volume. Under certain conditions of            high pressure and low temperatures the deviations from ideal gas law are significant and            the van der Waals equation should be used to accurately determine characteristics of a            sample of gas.
The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one                to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces                between them.
The constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a            particular gas, and the constant b corresponds to the volume of the molecules of a            particular gas. The ccorrectiond to the pressure term in the ideal gas law is                (n2a)/v2, and the ccorrectiond to the volume is nb. Note that            when V is relatively large and n is relatively small, both of these correction terms            become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV =            nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules            is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure.            Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some common gases are given in            table below.
At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than            the one for molecular volume, b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for            the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are            incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some            intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears            to follow the relationship given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This            behavior is reflected by the cdipsd in the graph seen below that we looked at earlier.            The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an            ideal gas, as pressure is raised. At very high pressures, the gas becomes less            compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly            significant fraction of the total gas volume.
Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions            between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an            appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of            low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave            ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be            disregardedthis is, however, very often not the case.
A 4.25-L flask contains 3.46 mol CO2 at 229 C. Calculate the pressure of                this sample of CO2:
(a) from the ideal gas law
P = \\frac{nRT}V
\equire{cancel} P = \\frac{3.46 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol}} \imes 0.08206 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}} \\mathrm{atm}                 \\cancel{\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}} \\cancel{\\mathrm{K^{-1}}} \imes 502 \\cancel{\\mathrm{K}}}{4.25 \\cancel{\\mathrm{L}}} = 33.5 \\mathrm{atm}
(b) from the van der Waals equation
\\left( P + \\frac{n^2a}{V^2} \ight) \imes (V - nb) = nRT \ightarrow P =                 \\frac{nRT}{(V - nb)} - \\frac{n^2a}{V^2}
P = \\frac{3.46 \\mathrm{mol} \imes 0.08206 \\mathrm{L\\ atm\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}} \imes 502 \\mathrm{K}}{                (4.25 \\mathrm{L} - 3.46 \\mathrm{mol} \imes 0.0427 \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}})} -                 \\frac{(3.46 \\mathrm{mol})^2 \imes 3.59 \\mathrm{L^2\\ atm\\ mol^2}}{(4.25 \\mathrm{L})^2}
P = 32.4 \\mathrm{atm}
(c) Explain the reason(s) for the difference.
This is not very different from the value from the ideal gas law because the                pressure is not very high and the temperature is not very low. The value is somewhat                different because CO2 molecules do have some volume and attractions                between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or                attractions.
