The stories on your Agile board are assigned certain points which relate to the amount of time and effort it would require to complete them. This would help the Product Owner and the Scrum Master get a sense of the team velocity at the end of the sprint and plan for the next sprints and project milestones accordingly. Your team collectively decides and assigns these points at the beginning of the sprint. During a particular sprint, you realize that the stories that you are working on require much more time than the allotted story points due to dependencies on the infrastructure team for running your experiments. Consider the following actions:</p><p id="fee5bdbbbd41437dabf5001c5cb59ddc">1. Go to the Agile Board of the team and change the story points to correctly reflect the time required to complete the story.</p><p id="ebade84c0b114f9aa37d89c99cb2c7f2">2.
