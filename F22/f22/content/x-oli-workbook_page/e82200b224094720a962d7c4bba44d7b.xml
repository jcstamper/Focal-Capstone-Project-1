Each of the tasks can be assigned to certain team members, and deliverables falling under each task could be documented along with the deliverable dates. For industry-oriented projects, it might be useful to include budget plans for every individual task. This would help judiciously distribute temporal, human, and monetary resources. The milestone plan developed in this section could be fairly specific, involving every minor update to the project. This could be communicated via a table of tasks, a flow diagram, or even a Gantt chart. These useful tools can further simplify the understanding process for future researchers and developers who would continue working in this domain.</p><p id="be983cbdf0084dbf832988bffa249249">Preparing such a comprehensive collection of documentation for any data science project. Diagrams in the documentation of a data science project are very useful as they help translate requirements and system design much more efficiently.</p></body></workbook_page>\n'
