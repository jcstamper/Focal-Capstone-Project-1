Data collection is the process of gathering and analyzing data that can meet defined business and analytic objectives. Data collection should be conducted systematically to ensure that the data is valid and reliable. In this section, we will explore the traditional methods used to collect data and describe how data can be collected via methods that reduce bias. </p><p id="bba8ee679c8a43d8b8a3f487b88787f0"><em>Data Collection Methods </em></p><p id="fb3cbd79673843b6bd7272b4a0a8fa08">Data collection before and during the data science project lifecycle includes data collected to define business and analytic objectives, data collected to define business requirements, and then the data needed for developing an analytic solution. Let us explore the traditional methods to collecting data:</p><p id="a319d9dc229341dba15adc15c999d2f2"><em style="italic"><em>Questionnaires and surveys.</em></em> Questionnaires are used to collect data from a group of individuals. Questionnaires can be administered on paper or online, it might be easier to distribute questionnaires online as there are efficient tools that can analyze the data. Questionnaires can have open-ended, closed-ended, rating, Likert scale, or multiple-choice questions. Data cleansing is still a consideration with questionnaire data as errors can occur. For example, responses to open-ended questions can contain misspellings among other errors. </p><p id="f8fb5fc775304d768601ef6a1f03164a"><em style="italic"><em>Interviews</em></em>. Interviews are used to collect data from small groups and unlike questionnaires, the questions are typically open-ended. </p><p id="a0f20368c13c4e40b4a42c15913cb8fd"><em style="italic"><em>Observations</em></em>. Data collected during an observation can support data collected during interviews and from questionnaires. Observations allow for the examination of subjects as they perform their duties. </p><p id="f7b1717cccb3431584f7ef2dc46749c5"><em style="italic"><em>Focus groups</em></em>. Focus groups can be used to explore topics that are difficult to observe, and sensitive topics. </p><p id="aded723b52a0431489089c7e6639da42">The collection methods above are can be considered as obtrusive data collection methods meaning the participants of the data collection exercise are aware that data is being collected from them for a purpose. There are unobtrusive data collection methods, those methods involve collecting data from web sources (Data from the web is used for data science related tasks including sentiment analysis, text classification, among others), document analysis, and use of available datasets from a data repository. Unobtrusive data collection methods can be done without the knowledge of the subject of the study. As is done in research studies and emphasized with data governance policies, data gathering must be done in an ethical manner.In the next module, we will explore collecting data from non traditional sources using non transforming and enriching the data to make it usable for analysis. </p><wb:inline idref="newccc769012dd24301849bcc525628b534" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>
