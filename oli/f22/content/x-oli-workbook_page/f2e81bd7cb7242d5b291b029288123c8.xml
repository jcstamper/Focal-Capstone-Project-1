This is the most important documentation of the project as it provides not only a low-level design of the system but also dives deep into the implementation details of the system. Some key design considerations that developers should address include assumptions that they will be making throughout the project, the various constraints involved, the system environment, and the design methodology. </p><p id="ac5c92b1b57e4588807eb453ba8a1947">The entire system architecture of both the low-level and high-level components should be explained while developing the design document of the data science project. A system architecture diagram can significantly simplify the explanation of the architecture of the solution. </p></body></workbook_page>\n'
