The data science project team will understand the needs of the system and stakeholders set by the business team and end-users (<em style="italic">elicit needs/expectations), </em>and then analyze and align the expectations to the business and analytic objectives to define the <em style="italic">requirements </em>for the project.</p><p id="bd3533feadbf4b16b949e277d6106c51">Requirements gathering should be performed systematically to ensure that information is extracted from diverse sources. This will ensure that little to no bias is introduced during the process and that all user and system needs are represented and met. It is important to note that different scenarios and circumstances call for a specific type of requirements-gathering technique. </p><p id="bb42ccbb799948f9987c3ac6ff41b529"><em>Requirements Gathering Techniques </em></p><ul id="ded26ef8b2764309923ef7b7f2c90284"><li><p id="f589c6f17eb343088ec35440d355ff7d"><em><em style="italic">Interviews</em></em>. Interviews allow the project team to thoroughly investigate the needs of the stakeholder. Interview questions are usually open-ended, providing an opportunity for the respondent to provide information about various aspects of the business and identify performance gaps specific to their roles. Bear in mind that this can be a time-consuming process. In order to ensure that an interview elicits the right information, an interviewer should develop questions that address the right issues and, in certain cases, probe for answers to get useful information related to the business, system, and user. Interviews can be conducted in a one-on-one setting or in a group setting.</p></li><li><p id="fc0166bb8dcb42e29e61ac7e8689b8b1"><em><em style="italic">Brainstorming</em></em>. Brainstorming sessions involve gathering ideas from multiple stakeholders at once. In a brainstorming session, a facilitator monitors the session to ensure all possible solutions are identified, and all parties contribute to the process in a reasonable amount of time. </p><p id="d017586c466543deb1e903adb1c18361">This technique can yield new ideas and themes that would otherwise be difficult for the analyst to produce. A brainstorming session should have five to eight representatives from each shareholder group, including management, users, and support staff.</p></li><li><p id="d268cafb45a24208b07e83cfbe9f6ce0"><em><em style="italic">Questionnaires</em></em>. The project team prepares and distributes a questionnaire with predefined questions to stakeholders in the company. The responses from these questionnaires are then analyzed and used to define the project requirements. A well-designed questionnaire can be completed by non-technical system users and stakeholders with little or no guidance from the project team. This technique can be used when interviews are not possible due to budget, time, and scheduling constraints.</p></li><li><p id="d8e3a1bd7dca4947b27aaf02c2233be3"><em><em style="italic">Document Analysis</em></em>. This is an information-gathering technique that involves reviewing existing documentation to elicit needs. Document analysis can be the first step in the requirements gathering process and can be used to create questions for questionnaires or interview sessions. Document analysis is considered to be a supporting technique and can serve as a completeness check for requirements.</p></li><li><p id="f4452322470a4cd293581e9de0835c3a"><em><em style="italic">Facilitated Workshops</em></em>.  A workshop, also known as a <link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_application_design" target="new" internal="false">Joint Application Design</link> session is facilitated by a neutral party, usually an outside consultant whose task is to collect information from stakeholders. These workshops should be structured yet interactive, and workshops can lead to the discovery of underlying issues within the business. A successfully executed workshop can result in the development of requirements. Participants of a workshop include a Scribe who records the discussions taking place during the session,  an Executive Sponsor who has the authority to make decisions about the project and who will set the vision of the project and resolve conflicts, and the appropriate client stakeholders, Subject Matter Experts, and Silent Observers.</p></li></ul><wb:inline idref="newcd7c87d3a7724f22818c075de594311a" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>\n'
