This data must either be available or sources are available to retrieve the data.</p></li><li><p id="f7626f9bee0f4119a7fa21bacfdd834a">The problem must be specific and realistic so that a corresponding data science project can succeed in principle.</p></li></ul><p id="de5de0be90cc4ee2b0d66a3bf9a8ece0">First, with the business objective clearly stated, one can propose a solution vision describing how the business can reach the objective. The path to realizing this vision can then be decomposed into sub-problems. The data science team will then be responsible for leveraging data to help solve these sub-problems and/or produce data-derived insight that allows the client to make good decisions along the way.</p><p id="e676bef49ef145108afab0bb05001125">As data-driven methods are still in the phase of being adopted across many fields, the perspective of using data to support business objectives may even be the main business objective that starts the whole engagement. In such a case, it is helpful to recall which higher-level business needs should be fulfilled in order to progress beyond \xe2\x80\x9cwe want to leverage data somehow\xe2\x80\x9d and arrive at a proper project formulation that allows the statement of specific requirements and evaluation criteria, even if they include exploratory tasks.</p><example id="f4336520b2da4206a9221c97d84510f9"><p id="ca71688e97e74c41a0d46172af132aa4">An online company asks for a data science project around the use of social media data for understanding its market, driven by the board\xe2\x80\x99s desire to keep up with the competition. After the data science team studies the business and explains to the client a number of possibilities regarding how social media streams are typically used in retail businesses, the client will focus on the need to increase market share and identify the business objective of increasing sales of a particular product. There seem to be two ways forward: (1) Spend money on increased advertising of a unique feature of their product or (2) lower the price. The client asks for an analysis of social media data to inform their decision. This need for gauging consumer preferences now forms the problem component of the analytic goal.</p></example><p id="cecc7569b7ea4d14a333c4e06b3d6e0d">Second, there must be a sound presumption that the problem\xe2\x80\x99s solution must benefit from the use of data. A collaborating team of domain experts and data scientists should discuss the available data sources and their suitability for the solution, including data that would need to be collected as part of the project. In order to be suitable, the data should exhibit informative patterns relating to the problem. It takes a combination of substantive expertise and data science skills to assess this criterion. </p><p id="f9247ece6faf46459e828c1a4814285b">Domain-specific problems around the availability of data include:</p><ul id="aaf159212547400bb765c846803d8d83"><li><p id="d7dc84b81ff54f119d9f42f4c5b583c9">Lack of readiness in the organization (e.g., the organization&apos;s data is not readily processable), unsuitability of the data for the objective (e.g., data is old/stale, out of domain, incomplete, or suffers from an obvious bias), or difficulty in collecting data because the expert labor involved is too expensive. </p></li><li><p id="dca71f6a208b42729d1e82108c92aa0f">Various technical objections, such as too little data for the required methods, fragmentation of data across multiple units with no suitable way of joining, or overwhelming imprecision/noise in the data. In cases where data is available, but the existence of a \xe2\x80\x9csignal\xe2\x80\x9d for the problem is uncertain, exploring whether the signal exists and the extent to which it can be leveraged can become an exploratory analytic objective in and of itself.</p></li></ul><p id="f48f6fcede254186be0264b64d2f59b5">Typically, data science projects/consultations involve a preliminary data survey that informs or even precedes a longer substantive discussion. It is very strongly recommended that such a survey be conducted before the team commits to fulfilling any analytical expectations on the part of the client. </p><p id="b08510d2530d4b4184d697bc4abb97be">Third, both the domain experts and data scientists must be in agreement that the problem is specific and realistic enough so that a data science project attempting to make progress towards it can succeed in principle. In other words, the system and/or insight produced by the project must add enough value to be deemed a success if executed properly. On the client&apos;s side, this criterion mandates a moderation of expectations and ensures that the data science component of the whole project can be evaluated. For example, while it should mostly be avoided, a solution vision may prove to be idealistic and somewhat resemble a science-fiction scenario. In such cases, the main purpose of the data science project is to assess its feasibility based on available data and methods and should be explicitly stated as such. On the other hand, the technicians must be very careful not to exaggerate analytical capacities and lead to unwarranted impressions that certain functionality is within reach. For example, once an initial data sample has been surveyed, the results should be communicated as being contingent on the assumption that the sample is representative of the larger dataset. Similarly, if a particular neural network model performs a classification task very well on some domain, the principle feasibility of transferring it to a second domain with reasonable performance should be explicitly tested before promising that it can perform at the same level.</p><wb:inline idref="newe0d43b7c923b456fb29141ab1c6ba10b" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>\n'
