That is, it pays to be explicit, rather than vague, about the nature of the population we are interested in studying. Doing so will ensure proper inference or conclusions about the data we study. Regardless of the study design, any analysis would suffer from potential incorrectnesses derived from any part of the data science lifecycle.</p><p id="ae51d46768e5428180d8c88c4bd0a44c" /><p id="b6a03f870f2a4c019bc2551303bf21b3"><em style="italic">Validity</em> is the development of sound evidence to demonstrate that the intended test interpretation (of the concept or construct that the test is assumed to measure) matches the proposed purpose of the test. This evidence is based on test content, response processes, internal structure, relations to other variables, and the consequences of testing. </p></body></workbook_page>\n'
