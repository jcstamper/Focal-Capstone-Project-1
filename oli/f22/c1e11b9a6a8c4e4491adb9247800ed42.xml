The disadvantage of this format is that matrices can be very sparse in certain domains. Sparsity refers to the fact that the majority of entries are unknown or missing. Sparsity leads to a waste of space and computational resources.</p></li><li><p id="e5179117479b4b4ca6d238af8ef3f3f8">Equivalent representations of A as a sparse matrix instead aim to store only the non-zero (non-empty) values and operate on them.</p></li><li><p id="a54cb162f5bd41c3887a1cacdee3e465">The sparse format is suitable for storing not only the input data but also model parameters in certain domains. For example, in computational biology, we typically need to build predictive models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) over a large number of features. We can opt to store the model weights in a sparse vector/matrix format to optimize training and inference.</p></li></ul></body></workbook_page>\n'
