While computer vision models take input feature matrices and output scalars or vectors, much like the standard machine learning paradigm, the fact that their inputs are images (2D or 3D matrices) presents several interesting challenges.</p><p id="e2b590be80824f3cba97747bd99a633e" /><p id="d1543850d7fe4e4e982c5e4232f9a795">Through the course of this module, we will be building upon the Deep Neural Network concepts introduced in the previous module. The power of neural networks, particularly multilayer perceptrons, lies in the ability to automatically extract a hierarchy of features at different levels of abstraction for classification tasks. As a result, neural networks preclude the need for feature engineering as standard machine learning methods require. However, one of its downsides is the presence of too many parameters and the inability to incorporate particular input structures required to model data from specific domains.</p><p id="f9beacb232a74d718225fc984e09743c" /><image id="b58d6ddc5a5a4229a4260076c336a393" src="../webcontent/image-d8b78764a4e748a1afa413780df9bf5b-1.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="245" width="468"><caption><p id="aa71fe1122354290aaece87d3223762d" /></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="df49358c77d54f339b0e4c0c2c04baee" /><p id="ce89262f97eb4529bfe3a481ce5f9b35">Figure 1.

In this image of a pickup truck (Figure 1), we get important signals regarding the objects within the truck, such as wheels, headlights, doors, and so on. The spatial proximity of the key features helps us understand what is happening in this image. This is the task of <em style="italic">image understanding</em> in computer vision. The input to all the computer vision models is the raw pixels in the images, which are just matrices of numbers representing the intensity levels of various spatial locations. From the computer&apos;s view, an image (Figure 2) is just a big matrix with a number (or tuple of numbers) at every pixel (Figure 3).</p><p id="ec8d4b5af66f4b1a992a1901c58f92c1" /><image id="e5a852f9587e46f9a0655948822c6f2e" src="../webcontent/image-d8b78764a4e748a1afa413780df9bf5b-2.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="320" width="468"><caption><p id="a06599cf926f451cb8401ecf3df0037a" /></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="f3ba35afd19f47c29e3cdfe925dd59c2">Figure 2.

However, by doing so, we lose the valuable signal captured by the spatial structure of the image. Therefore, while learning useful visual features in computer vision, the key idea is to preserve and use the spatial structure of the image. One way is to use some spatial filters to extract a spatially adjacent set of pixels in the image and then feed those image patches to a multilayer perceptron. This idea sparked the need for a mechanism for weighting those extracted patches from the image to highlight their relative importance. In addition, it is sensible to use spatial filters of varying sizes to extract features at different resolutions. The algorithm we described was formalized as the convolutional neural network (CNN).</p><p id="a2c69b490845473fa400d34ed282a017" /><p id="ac8724ae5da9436c84b9ffaeb6d34316">In this module, we will introduce the basic CNN architecture and classic architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet, which you will be implementing during the Computer Vision task in one of the Projects during the course.

The text images can be typed, handwritten, or printed into machine-encoded text such as a scanned document, a photo of a document, or an image that contains the text. Figure 4 shows the results of probably the first OCR task, LeNet.

It might be relatively easy for a human to look at a photograph or watch a video and spot people, objects, scenes, and visual details. However, it is not as straightforward for a computer not only to recognize the items but also to understand what the items mean to the level of understanding of a human. Object recognition is a key technology behind driverless cars (Figure 5), enabling them to recognize a stop sign or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is also valuable for disease identification in bioimaging, industrial inspection, and robotic vision applications, just to name a few.</p><p id="ce536bed95514f6a9bd368840edfeb75" /><image id="ddd9adf78cb04388b767fc9165a2c5a9" src="../webcontent/image-d8b78764a4e748a1afa413780df9bf5b-5.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="258" width="353"><caption><p id="d89fa066be934d489f3c8aea1e15cc7b" /></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="da6775013cd94e19a94e40fef27153e4">Figure 5.

While similar to object detection as a task, where features are detected and localized, facial recognition performs not only detection but also recognition of the detected face. Facial recognition systems search for standard features and landmarks like eyes, lips, or a nose and classify a face using these features and the positioning of these items.
