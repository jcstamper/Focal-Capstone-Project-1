The labeled data is considered previous knowledge that has both input and output parameters. This method of training a model is called <em style="italic">Supervised Learning. </em>DeepAI has a concise definition of supervised learning, it is defined as &quot;A class of systems and algorithms that determine a predictive model using data points with known outcomes.&quot; </p><p id="c8f4f77276e040dd87cba6f875e57087">Supervised Learning tasks can be used for Classification and  Regression tasks. Both tasks use algorithms to train the models. We will explore in the next pages and onwards. </p><p id="a30f40a7433a47758b218841ad85cb71">We have covered techniques should as Linear and Logistic Regression, we will explore some popular techniques including <em style="italic">k</em>-Nearest Neighbors, Tree Methods, and naive Bayes. As you continue your journey in the MCDS program especially in the Machine Learning course, you will explore supervised learning tasks outside of the well known algorithms introduced in this course. </p><table id="edcd500837d34e638fd1e1d3e9e81bb3" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="ibb9a0d7752194eb08c4d7304d051538e" /><caption><p id="d797a92f5afd48cca4d86307dda5db17" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="aaac1054c9c14d69a52edbc6ff910735"><em>Reading: A comprehensive list of </em><link href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html" target="new" internal="false">Supervised Learning </link><em>algorithms. </em></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="dd71d1ea2156479d9f6512a5f2b0e32b"><em>Reading</em>: <link href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364" target="new" internal="false">Supervised Learning and Natural Language Processing</link></p></td></tr></table></body></workbook_page>\r\n'
