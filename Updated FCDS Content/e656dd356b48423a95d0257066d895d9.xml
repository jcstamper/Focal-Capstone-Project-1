Later in this course, we will discuss cross-validation, but we must note here that feature engineering can be done during the cross-validation process. <em style="italic">Cross-Validation </em>is a model validation technique used to assess how a model will generalize to a new data set. At this time, feature engineering is done during the cross-validation loop. </p><p id="a23eabdf0f9242489f71dc97fb055e61">Feature engineering at any stage can introduce bias to the data. While you manipulate the data, you can unintentionally create a relationship between features that do not otherwise exist. The features that are selected or created during the feature engineering process can shape the insights that are gotten from the model.</p></body></workbook_page>\n'
