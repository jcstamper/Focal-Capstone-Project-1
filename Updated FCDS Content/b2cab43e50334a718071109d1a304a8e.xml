They proposed a CNN architecture called LeNet for the task of document recognition. In particular, the task they considered was to recognize handwriting. The architecture of LeNet (Figure 9) contains two convolutional layers separated by two pooling layers, and then finally, two fully connected layers to perform the eventual classification. The convolutional filters used were of size 5x5, with a stride of size 1, whereas the pooling layers were 2x2 with a stride of 2.</p><image id="e5d98341d07e488cae5e5353d6b26890" src="../webcontent/image-bb16329a3c9145988127e4388ebc07b4-1.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="194" width="650"><caption><p id="f1172881179f42fdb07ea30e6dba1c91">Figure 9.

It was the first CNN-based winner of the ImageNet challenge. It achieved an error rate of 15.3 percent on ImageNet in 2012, which was state-of-the-art at that time. The architecture of AlexNet (Figure 10) contains five convolutional layers with max pooling and three fully connected layers before making 1,000 class prediction problems via the softmax function. AlexNet contained eight layers and was also the first to use the fast and efficient Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions and used extensive data augmentation. The original AlexNet uses 11x11 convolutional filters with a stride of size 4.

A noteworthy successor to AlexNet was the architecture called <link href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf" target="new" internal="false">VGGNet</link> from Oxford University. It cut the error rate of AlexNet on ImageNet in half as it got an error rate of just 7.3 percent. VGGNet was twice as deep as the AlexNet as it had 16 layers and used smaller convolutional filters of size 3 by 3. In total, VGGNet had a staggering 138 million model parameters. The main rationale for using smaller filters and more layers is that the stack of smaller filters has the same receptive field as some larger ones, but more layers allow us to incorporate more non-linearities and potentially fewer model parameters overall.</p><image id="b795111de07548e79a4811d4b2d8a2f7" src="../webcontent/image-bb16329a3c9145988127e4388ebc07b4-4.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="550" width="650"><caption><p id="b3e471da1a854ace953bda2ed4b2f6f9">Figure 12.

(2015)</link> introduced the Residual Network or ResNet as &quot;shortcut connections&quot; that allow layers to be skipped. ResNet researchers showed that a 56-layer neural network has both higher training as well as a higher testing error compared to a 20-layer network. One reason for this surprising finding is that the valuable predictive signal attenuates as it passes through many layers and the associated activation functions. The solution to this problem and the key idea behind a ResNet is to fit the residual value of the signal instead of the actual desired mapping. Doing so allows us to train a staggering 152-layer residual network with an error rate of just 3.57 percent on the ImageNet dataset, which is actually better than human-level accuracy on this task.</p><image id="aa326c481e1540fcbbb123c428e3cdc4" src="../webcontent/image-bb16329a3c9145988127e4388ebc07b4-5.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="360" width="650"><caption><p id="ac23fc5d5c74455c84e38809ca2d9733">Figure 13.

The left figure shows a standard layer in a CNN where it tries to fit the actual desired mapping H of x. A residual layer, in contrast, fits the residual F(x) = H(x) - x. Architecturally, it is acquired using a residual or a short-circuit connection, as shown in the right figure. It is common to use residual connections after every couple of convolutional layers, as seen on the architectural diagram of ResNet-18 in Figure 14.</p><image id="a498afd740ad49fe8e652340c8467300" src="../webcontent/image-bb16329a3c9145988127e4388ebc07b4-6.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="800" width="300"><caption><p id="dd103454335543e08088619a7b08deab">Figure 14.

In recent years, the trend has been to go deeper as extra layers of non-linearities give significant accuracy boosts. In addition, recent algorithms use smaller filters as they can have similar receptive fields as some of the larger filters but simultaneously are parsimonious in terms of model parameters. Further, it is also becoming increasingly common to residual connections in state-of-the-art CNN architectures these days. Figure 15, taken from a <link href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07678.pdf" target="new" internal="false">2017 paper by Canziani et al.</link>, shows the accuracies of different models on the ImageNet dataset. It is a remarkably rapid area of research with successive innovations, and most modern-day architectures achieve accuracies better than humans on the ImageNet dataset.</p><image id="f9af0794fc584c11acc3a79697ac5295" src="../webcontent/image-bb16329a3c9145988127e4388ebc07b4-7.png" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="230" width="640"><caption><p id="d552e007d6d2400fbd54a006bcf0fae3">Figure 15.
