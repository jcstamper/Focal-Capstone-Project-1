Figure 1 lists the steps that are followed during the process. Requirements gathering for a data science project will involve eliciting the needs of the stakeholders and defining the requirements for the analytic solution(s).</p><image id="ac098fbf5d5b4c4d97cb56cbd5d328bb" src="../webcontent/Requirements.jpg" alt="" style="inline" vertical-align="middle" height="587" width="650"><caption><p id="c1b697565bce4dbc8b17f20329ea9b98">Figure 1. Requirement Gathering Process</p></caption><popout enable="false"></popout></image><p id="fcb3aaebaa454b4b9472f2eea1ef9c88">The requirements-gathering process involves eliciting user and system needs and defining data and analytic requirements for the successful implementation of a data-related project.</p><p id="abb67c819baf4ea7809dd2481ff4baab"><em>Gather Information: </em>The first step in gathering information is to identify the stakeholders within the business; the stakeholders will be individuals who perform tasks that will meet the business&apos;s need, as well as decision-makers within the business. Once stakeholders are identified, the business analyst will elicit information to determine what the solution should do to meet the defined business and analytic objectives. Later on in this unit, we will discuss the techniques used to gather information.</p><p id="df9b93d6adb24dcf83feaf651eeb2c01"><em>Define and Prioritize Requirements: </em>Stakeholders will provide information according to their view of the business needs; it is the job of the business analyst to lead the effort in defining and prioritizing requirements. It is important to document &quot;complete&quot; requirements that capture the needs of the stakeholders, as this will guide the project team in developing the right solution(s). Stakeholders might provide information that can be used for future projects related to the proposed solution; that information should not be discarded; it is prioritized as a low-priority requirement and considered for future implementation.</p><p id="d6cdc93f185548c9a42faf01f2aa5741"><em>Evaluate Requirements: </em>The project team must verify and validate all documented requirements. This additional step in the requirements-gathering process will ensure that the solution meets the business needs and satisfies the expectations of the stakeholders.</p><p id="c5f0fbcc381f4bd6ac30d5dd22fb4051"><em>Receive Sign-Off: </em>This is an indication that the requirements have been approved and agreed upon by the client. Requirements are signed off twice during the development lifecycle; sign-offs take place prior to the start of solution development and after testing the solution.</p><p id="e96435e54ba84532b8ac07f16852804e"><em>Requirements Management Plan</em></p><p id="a7d1f921bdf64bb7b30033256b49df13">A <em style="italic">requirements management plan</em> can be used to document the requirements-gathering process. This document is made available to the client and the project team as it contains information that affects both parties. There is no standard template for this document, but it is in good practice to include the following sections:</p><p id="a85caf4dc0e5423c9f0ac77b9232beef"><em>The project description</em> is an overview of your project. This section describes the purpose of your project.</p><p id="f2c88ada2cd643018e312c828f10c0a1"><em>Team Responsibilities</em> are defined in this plan to designate who will be involved in managing activities during the requirements-gathering process. Data science project team members might take on duties outside of their normal roles, e.g., a data analyst on the data science team might serve in the role of Scribe during joint application development sessions.</p><p id="f3829d8cbbbd497bb775671aa794d0ff"><em>Tools</em> used to manage the requirements include project management tools and word processing or other dedicated systems used to capture, manage, and track requirements through the requirements-gathering process and throughout the project lifecycle.</p><p id="ca1a2680df4f4985b85e3dfdb769fb16"><em>Requirements Gathering Process </em>should be defined in this plan. This section will describe the techniques used in eliciting user and system needs, defining the requirements, and evaluating the success of the requirements-gathering process (these techniques are covered later in this unit).</p><table id="d6ed29f5eee04749bad5802cff7f1960" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="i427c008884c940f6b47a174f429990d0" /><caption><p id="cd154efc0a714615821a0e3269c5e83d" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="e23fa408bada4f478688fdab55f62173"><em style="italic">Change control and requirements gathering</em>: Modern-day collaboration tools will support change control.
