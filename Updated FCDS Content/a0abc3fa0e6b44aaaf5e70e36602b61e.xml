The data collection techniques for a sentiment analysis project analyzing social media tweets will differ from the techniques of an image classification project for patient diagnosis. When you defined the project&apos;s business and analytic objectives, the tasks and methods were proposed as well, those tasks and methods drive the type of data that will be used in the project. The type of data will influence the source and data collection techniques. </p><p id="e6ac62b475384928a703ecfe7c4d56c4">This module described the traditional techniques for data collection. Those techniques include conducting interviews, focus groups, document analysis, and observations. There are various types of data and this affects the method employed to solve your analytic objective.</p><p id="d6e3ca89d5884674836bfcf39aebf1a9">A data scientist should also know the different sources of data and how it affects the solution development process. There is data that is sourced by your client but controlled by an external source and data that is collected and owned by your client.</p><activity idref="newb8e4f2938ef7460ab6684f76ad70e9e1" purpose="checkpoint" /></body></workbook_page>\n'
