An analytic objective can typically be phrased along with the following template: </p><table id="dbd6ef09acab490a8cc760ebae98d1ff" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="i325a5999e8b843be97cc54cf59186879" /><caption><p id="decb1070ab8c495f8a44eecd66ab2ebe" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="b358ec4e54374ccdb015bdfc9be71f35">As an incremental step towards business objective <em>O </em></p><p id="ecaf85a9eb094c2a8342e44aa9757a7e">We work towards solving problem <em>P </em></p><p id="b486dfc963c747f9895971f126125620">by focusing on specific tasks <em>T</em></p><p id="b239d109c4244edea8069e07e07b14af">and applying analytic methods <em>M</em> in conjunction with data <em>D</em></p><p id="d5b96a7d67c2406ab224099d2557d889">to create valuable functionality <em>F</em> and/or produce insight <em>I</em></p></td></tr></table><p id="c2923268e798499398275b9488d95d42">This formulation of an analytic objective can also be considered a research hypothesis because it effectively posits that a certain technique improves a metric with regard to a population of problem instances (comparable to treatment versus control condition). In fact, in academic settings, the effectiveness of data science methods will regularly be scrutinized using statistical tests, and it is good practice to principally strive for similar methodological rigor in industry applications. While data science teams and projects in the private sector may use different terminology and specific technical or other circumstances may differ, this pattern of formulating analytic objectives is a very good point of departure for framing data science work and effectively communicating with clients and domain experts. It is the connecting element between the problem, the technique to be applied, the associated requirements and evaluation, as well as the business objective. Also, one should keep in mind that projects often comprise multiple analytic objectives that form a larger plan.</p><p id="cd503432287742a196776876fadfe5d4">In order for you to become proficient in working with this definition, we will now move to examine its components.</p><wb:inline idref="newe24dd5075d2540cd9de815c1d10f3492" purpose="didigetthis" /></body></workbook_page>\n'
