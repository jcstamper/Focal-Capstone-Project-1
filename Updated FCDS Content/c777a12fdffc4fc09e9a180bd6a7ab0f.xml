It is important because it facilitates effective data management and has positive implications for the quality, security, and integrity of data used for analysis. An organization that handles data efficiently understands that data governance impacts data quality and the decisions made from the data available to the organization. This unit focuses on data governance as a component of data management and how it influences the development of analytic solutions in an organization and its decision-making. Any organization that stores and utilizes data should have a data governance strategy for internal data, or data stored within the organization, and external data.</p><p id="f86b0e287e044f3a980528bd2bfd50dd">Data governance is beneficial because it provides a reliable and consistent view of enterprise-wide data. It ensures that there is a plan for improved quality of data, maps the location of data in the enterprise, reduces the scourge of data silos, and improves data management overall.</p><table id="c2d1d829052e4700ae14bbdb6df0db04" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="ic003c4a763894898983f19cbc0904a0e" /><caption><p id="d8b4f553038745c48d6c827afdba44d8" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="eb14cc31d77e4fceaa56d922ada468fe"><link href="http://eprints.staffs.ac.uk/2804/1/A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Designing_Data_Governan.pdf" target="new" internal="false">Reading: Data Governance in the Cloud.</link></p></td></tr></table><p id="f4bd7e7a731a463d807384100ce06e33">Data governance is the responsibility of an entire organization; although it is often administered by the data management team, all users of data in an organization are considered stakeholders of the organization&apos;s data. The Data Governance Institute defines a stakeholder as an individual or group that makes or is affected by data-driven decisions within an organization. In addition to data governance policies, data stakeholders will have an influence on the state and use of data. As a quick reminder, the data science team works with different individuals in an organization to define business and analytic objectives during the data science project lifecycle, as well as to determine the requirements for the analytic solution. So why is data governance important to a member of a data science project team?</p><p id="d1b3c951c9a348cb8300a973802bc362">Data governance is more than just policymaking for data. Iit influences business strategy because data are now (more than ever) considered an asset to an organization. An organization that has embedded data governance principles into its data infrastructure or data management framework is an organization able to abide by data standards (whether industry-set or company-defined).</p><p id="c03235bb414743a2a4c1ab38abfdebfe">Data governance best practices for organizations are met when data has integrity, and data-related decisions and controls are transparent and can be audited. Another best practice gaining ground in the industry is for organizations to collect and store data that is unbiased. Unbiased data means something different to each organization and industry, but the general idea is that the data represent all members of a population that could be served by an organization. This best practice will positively influence the development of ethical models and algorithms for analytic solutions.</p><table id="dbdd9a989e424e9cad5508085cea59fa" summary="" rowstyle="plain"><cite id="i6791f8ecc8394b559160b6a3f3341991" /><caption><p id="cc49364245ba4d2298fd7c1f7fb12a3a" /></caption><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left"><p id="ed6de913e16e4640bb64e2ccbb44212e"><link href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2016.0117" target="new" internal="false">Reading: Data Governance and Its Implications for Ethical Models.</link></p></td></tr></table><section id="a128ac4b118c4a708763378e5f36f3b5"><title>What is Data Governance Used for?</title><body><p id="c6cb51dd03dc41ba9ccd5f548cf4cd72">Data governance is necessary to ensure that data is safe, secure, private, usable, and in compliance with both internal and external data policies. Data governance allows setting and enforcing controls that allow greater access to data, gaining security and privacy from the controls on data. Some common use cases include:</p><ul id="eca465e28122493fa83dce969e2c70fa"><li><p id="df88d58bffca416b9db167dc76eadea8"><em>Data stewardship.</em> Data governance often means giving accountability and responsibility for both the data itself and the processes that ensure its proper use to \xe2\x80\x9cdata stewards.\xe2\x80\x9d</p></li><li><p id="d819aebe72704ae9be2f0b5d14c6ec3e"><em>Data quality.</em> Data governance is also used to ensure data quality, which refers to any activities or techniques designed to make sure data is suitable to be used. Data quality is generally judged on six dimensions: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness.</p></li><li><p id="b0a480a5a9854dd3ac09c6cd174fc0a0"><em>Data management.</em> This is a broad concept encompassing all aspects of managing data as an enterprise asset, from collection and storage to usage and oversight, making sure that data  are leveraged securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively before they are disposed of.</p></li></ul></body></section></body></workbook_page>\n'
