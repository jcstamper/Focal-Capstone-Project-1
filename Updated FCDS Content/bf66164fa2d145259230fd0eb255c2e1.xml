They can typically be stated in broader terms, e.g., acquiring new customers, reducing production costs, improving the quality of its products, or increasing brand awareness. At the start of a data science project, the data science team will work with a client to understand the specific business need.</p><p id="c07771f66889472fb2542ecff5c95cb5">To meet a particular need, the company will identify one or more specific business objectives it can work towards. These objectives are stated fairly concretely and often have time periods associated with them, after which, somewhat simplified, they will be considered reached (in case of success) or not reached (in case of failure). For example, a business may want to increase sales of a particular product by a certain margin through online advertising, be smarter about scaling production to market fluctuations, reduce travel costs for its logistics, or get a better sense of current trends in its customer base for better product development.</p><p id="b4f102a657d24343b4e72957b716609b">Given a business\xe2\x80\x99s needs and objectives, one can now evaluate whether data science methods can be used to facilitate the company&apos;s efforts to meet them. However, the objectives in question will typically be framed in terms of business terminology and assumptions. A data science team will first engage with the client to understand the situation in sufficient depth and establish effective communication with the company\xe2\x80\x99s domain experts. Once the team has familiarized themselves with the problem, as well as the available data and resources, it will work with the client to develop a solution vision. This vision is effectively a walkthrough of what a full data-driven solution to the problem could look like. Based on this, one can identify a set of analytic objectives that, if achieved, will facilitate realizing the solution and reaching the business goal.</p><p id="d1a67024c65444ba9719fe7ff8f7cd92">In this context, an analytic objective states, in specific terms, what the data science project should produce (insight, resource, model, etc.) and serves as the main success criterion for the team. On the technical side, it drives the derivation of requirements for the project. On the business side, it is critical that analytical objectives stay firmly connected to the business objectives they facilitate.</p><wb:inline idref="newc26dfd3238be4dd2a0ea4b8d2abb59c1" purpose="learnbydoing" /></body></workbook_page>\n'
