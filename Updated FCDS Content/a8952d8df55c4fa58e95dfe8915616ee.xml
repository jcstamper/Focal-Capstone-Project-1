In <em>an observational study</em>, the threat to validity can arise by the inability to account for whether the observed changes can be attributed to the exposure or intervention and not to other causes and whether we can generalize that exposure more universally causes the outcomes.</p><p id="b0d59e35ea13422698b6d113497d5f3b">There are four types of validity:</p><ol id="fb9db00999634eed8f41c5b8b70d7493"><li><p id="ff265cafc4bc429387623ffdc44f78c8">Statistical conclusion validity refers to the appropriate use of statistics (e.g., violating statistical assumptions, restricted range on a variable, low power) to infer whether the presumed independent and dependent variables covary in the experiment.</p></li><li><p id="eb0e8a5a630141fa89650af38c9eb48e">Construct validity refers to the validity of inferences about the constructs (or variables) in the study.</p></li><li><p id="cf52e45b0d2f4361a2c5a1d3fb6a65f7">Internal validity relates to the validity of inferences drawn about the cause-and-effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables.</p></li><li><p id="c08509357eca488b8a4fa9a23ff9a452">External validity refers to the validity of the cause and effect relationship being generalizable to other persons, settings, treatment variables, and measures.</p></li></ol><p id="cc0659c0563d49378974853368131276">In this module, we will discuss external and internal validity in more detail.</p><section id="d0af45c44d4647e3b2e94a55ff383ca3"><title>External Validity</title><body><p id="ee8ba18d9c5f47178ea1e2bb312ab176">As data scientists, once we have defined the population of interest for the study, we must work hard to ensure that the data we will collect or the data given to us is representative of that population. For example, to investigate the impact of class size on high school student achievement, we need to decide whether it is possible to obtain a simple random sample of students from the population of students who are enrolling in formal education institutions in the United States. Alternatively, we might decide that we only want to study students in public schools, private schools, charter schools, etc., or that we want to study all high school students regardless of age. No matter what the sampling plan is, it is critical that the data we use are a <em>representative sample</em> of the population we want to study. Doing so is crucial to ensure the <em style="italic">external validity</em> of the study. <em style="italic">External validity</em> refers to the ability to generalize the findings or results to a known population of interest. <em style="italic">Threats to external validity</em> are problems that threaten our ability to draw correct inferences from the sample data to other persons, settings, treatment variables, and measures.</p><p id="cbb48c312a724b4b85f38cf033cc0de9"><em style="italic">Sampling bias</em> is bias in which data is collected in a way that some members or groups of members in a population are systematically more likely or less likely to be selected in a sample than others. Sampling bias results in discriminatory data with over- or under-represented instances that are related to the study design or data collection method and can occur in both probabilistic and nonprobabilistic sampling. A study measuring the completion rate of graduate students in the United States with a sample of students from one socioeconomic background, race, or gender will undermine the external validity of that study. This means the results of the study can not be truly generalized to the entire population of graduate students in the United States.</p></body></section><section id="f37cd3160fbf449b8ad3d435435b06f1"><title>Internal Validity</title><body><p id="b0b92c9bff3e4ead817112960bdd8ff7">As data scientists, we want to conduct sound research that produces meaningful, impactful, or novel results for stakeholders.

Bias made can be consciously or unconsciously, and it will affect the performance of a data science model but, most importantly, the analytic solution and the decisions made after the implementation of that solution.</p><p id="c27f25f30592433ba49461a1fbbec4b2">Statistical bias results from violations of external validity or internal validity of a study. In the previous module, we explored sampling bias that undermines external validity. In this module, we will explore additional common statistical biases that you need to be aware of and take into account during the data understanding process.</p><p id="c3b7256468344ea491784d96a6afaf03"><em style="italic">Selection Bias</em>, a threat to internal validity, occurs when there is a mismatch between the data selected for the study and the subject matter that the data scientist wants to make inferences about. Selection bias is usually a concern of studies using convenience samples. </p><p id="ddda1d4007a3490ab89ad5c3e6660d1a"><em style="italic">Self-selection Bias</em> occurs when individuals select themselves to be included in a study. Self-selection bias is a threat to the external validity of the study since such bias is usually untrollable during the data collection phase. Self-selection bias is often associated with certain characteristics of the sample that induce such individuals to be included in the resulting study sample. Take the example of a survey. If the response rate of a survey is not perfect, it is likely that certain characteristics of those individuals are related to the reason why they responded to the survey. </p><p id="cba12fb2d1b341fe949cc76e279e1ec2"><em style="italic">Confirmation Bias</em>. Your prior knowledge, beliefs, and values can play a role in the data that is used to build your analytic solution. This is because, as humans, we are prone to use our personal beliefs and experiences to guide us through daily life and decision-making. This type of bias occurs when we favor evidence that confirms our personal beliefs, values, and hypotheses.</p><p id="e0a553934b0a4222b3cb2c5eec4cce67"><em style="italic">Information Bias. </em>Also known as measurement bias, it occurs when data is collected, measured, or interpreted wrongly. Misclassification of observations is an example of information bias. For example, an observation with attributes similar to the stereotypical female student is recorded as female when that observation is actually from a male student. Another example is the misclassification of patients. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,  groups under the age of 45 are seen as low risk. o during a screening exercise, those in that age group might not be screened and therefore classified as negative. The data collected then has a misclassification bias and is not accurate. One way to control information bias is to implement <em style="italic">blinding</em>.</p><p id="de4f8c9a963440f7a94f3fc349ef1249"><em style="italic">Confounding Bias </em>occurs when incorrect inferences are made about the subject matters while failing to account for a potentially confounding variable, an exogenous factor that causes the subject matters of interest.</p></body></section></body></workbook_page>\n'
